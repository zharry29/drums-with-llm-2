You will compose some drum beats for a song. First, let's learn about a drum notation. A bar of drum beats may look like this:
@@@
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|S--o|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|-O--|---o
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----
@@@
Each line corresponds to an instrument on a drum set:
K: Kick drum
S: Snare drum
H: Hihat
T: Toms
C: Crash cymbal
R: Ride cymbal
Each character in a line represents a 16-th note. Each four characters separated by | constitute a beat. Note that there are 16 characters, not counting the |, because there are 16 16-th notes in a bar which constitute 4 beats. Each character is - if the instrument is not played on that note. When played, the character denotes the articulation which varies by instruments.
- For all instruments, O is a hard open hit, while o is a soft open hit. These two are the only articulations for Kick, Toms, and Cymbals.
- For Snare drum only, there are additionally S and s, which are hard and soft sidestick hits.
- For Hihat only, there are additionally X and x, which are hard and soft closed hits.

Additionally, here are a list of rules and conventions of drumming:
- Only two of Snare, Hihat, Toms, and Cymbals can be played at once (because a drummer only have two hands)
- Kick is usually only played with hard hits. Typically, it is not played with the Snare.
- Snare is sually played with hard open or sidestick hits on the backbeat. For most music styles, the backbeats are the first 16-th note on beat 2 and beat 4.
- HiHat is usually played regularly, but not necessarily so.
- Crash Cymbals are usually played in conjuction with the Kick, but not with the HiHat. 

To test your understanding, compose any reasonable bar of drum beat in the above notation. You should always put the notation between @@@ as the example above.
