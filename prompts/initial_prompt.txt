You will compose some drum beats for a song. First, let's learn about a drum notation. A bar of drum beats may look like this:
@@@
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|S--o|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|-O--|---o
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

Each line corresponds to an instrument on a drum set:
K: Kick drum
S: Snare drum
H: Hihat
T: Toms
C: Crash cymbal
R: Ride cymbal
Each character in a line represents a 16-th note. Each four characters separated by | constitute a beat. Note that there are 16 characters, not counting the |, because there are 16 16-th notes in a bar which constitute 4 beats. Each character is - if the instrument is not played on that note. When played, the character denotes the articulation which varies by instruments.
- For all instruments, O is a hard open hit, while o is a soft open hit. These two are the only articulations for Kick, Toms, and Cymbals.
- For Snare drum only, there are additionally S and s, which are hard and soft sidestick hits.
- For Hihat only, there are additionally X and x, which are hard and soft closed hits.
