Each line corresponds to an instrument on a drum set:
K: Kick drum
S: Snare drum
H: Hihat
T: Toms
C: Crash cymbal
R: Ride cymbal
Each character in a line represents a 16-th note. Each four characters separated by | constitute a beat. Note that there are 16 characters, not counting the |, because there are 16 16-th notes in a bar which constitute 4 beats. Each character is - if the instrument is not played on that note. When played, the character denotes the articulation which varies by instruments.
