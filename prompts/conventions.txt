Additionally, here are a list of rules and conventions of drumming:
- Only two of Snare, Hihat, Toms, and Cymbals can be played at once (because a drummer only have two hands)
- Kick is usually only played with hard hits. Typically, it is not played with the Snare.
- Snare is sually played with hard open or sidestick hits on the backbeat. For most music styles, the backbeats are the first 16-th note on beat 2 and beat 4.
- HiHat is usually played regularly, but not necessarily so.
- Crash Cymbals are usually played in conjuction with the Kick, but not with the HiHat.
