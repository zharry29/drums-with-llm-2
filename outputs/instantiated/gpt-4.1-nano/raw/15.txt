Certainly! To add accents on the quarter note down beats, we will mark those beats with a hard closed hi-hat notation (X), and for the rest of the 16th notes, we'll keep it as soft closed hi-hat (x). The down beats occur at the first and third beats of each measure, which correspond to the first and ninth notes in each line.

Here is the edited drum groove:

This notation:

- Plays a hard closed hi-hat (X) on every 16th note.
- Places an accent (X) on the down beats (beats 1 and 3), i.e., the first and ninth notes of each measure.
- The rest of the hi-hat notes are soft (x). However, since the instructions specify to play the closed hi-hat on all 16th notes with accents on down beats, I used X for all notes to emphasize the accent points.

Let me know if you'd like the accents only on the down beats or a different articulation!
