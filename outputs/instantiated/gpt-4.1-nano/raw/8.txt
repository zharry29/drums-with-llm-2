Sure! To make the drum groove feel fuller, I will add more hits to the existing pattern, especially in the kick, snare, and hi-hat parts, while maintaining the overall feel. Here's the revised groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|S---|--S-|S---
H: --x-|-x-x|--x-|-x-x
T: ----|--T-|----|--T-
C: ----|X---|----|X---
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

In this new version:
- The hi-hat now includes some softer closed hits (x) on off-beats to create more energy.
- The snare hits are slightly increased for a fuller backbeat.
- Added tom hits (T) to create movement.
- Crash cymbals (X) are placed on beats 2 and 4 for accentuation.

Would you like me to make it more complex or keep it at this level?
