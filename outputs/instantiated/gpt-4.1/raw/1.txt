**Thought Process:**

In your given groove, only the Hihat ("H") is playing consistently throughout the bar. According to the request, you want to have "not only hihat but also cymbal." In this notation, you have two cymbals available: Crash ("C") and Ride ("R"). The Crash is already present only on the first beat; letâ€™s add some Ride presence to complement the Hihat, possibly in a pattern that doesn't overpower but supports the groove.

Here's a plan:
- Keep the hihat pattern as is.
- Add Ride cymbal hits to accentuate the groove, for example, on the "and" (the second sixteenth note) of each beat or the downbeats, providing flavor.
- The Crash remains just for emphasis at the first beat.

Here's the resulting groove:
