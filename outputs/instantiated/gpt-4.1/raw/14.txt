Let's analyze the request: "Let's fill up the whole bar with double kick."

**Meaning:**  
- "Double kick" refers to playing the kick drum on every 8th (or, in metal, often every 16th) noteâ€”i.e., every slot in the bar gets an 'O' or 'o' for the kick, no dashes.  
- All other parts (snare, cymbals) stay the same as the original, unless otherwise specified.

**Original Kick line:**  
```
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
```
- This has some gaps.
- We need to replace all '-'s with 'O' (hard open hit, since the original already uses 'O', not 'o').

**Resulting Kick line:**  
```
K: OOOO|OOOO|OOOO|OOOO
```
- 16 'O's, matching a "filled up" double kick for the entire bar.

**Other instruments:**  
- Leave as per the original.
