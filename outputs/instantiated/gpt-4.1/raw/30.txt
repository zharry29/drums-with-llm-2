**Thought Process:**

1. The phrase '1 e & a' refers to the way beats are subdivided in 16th notes for each quarter note beat: 
   - 1 (downbeat, 1st 16th note)
   - e (2nd 16th note)
   - & (3rd 16th note)
   - a (4th 16th note)

2. The second beat starts at the fifth character (since there are four 16th notes per beat), which follows the notation:  
   Beat 1: 1  e  &  a |  
           1  2  3  4   

   Beat 2: 1  e  &  a (positions 5,6,7,8)

3. "The 'a' of the '1 e & a' of the second beat" refers to the 8th character (in 1-based counting).

4. The request is to have a cymbal hit (C) on this specific note. So, in the Crash "C" line, I will make sure the 8th character is 'O' (a hard hit).

5. The rest of the groove remains unchanged.

**Original Crash (C) line:**  
C: ----|----|----|----

**Edited Crash (C) line:**  
The 8th character (end of second beat) changes from '-' to 'O'.

So:
First bar: ----|---O|----|----

**Here is the new groove:**

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|S---|--S-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|---O|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
