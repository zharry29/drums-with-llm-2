To satisfy the request "Add some snare to the groove," I will look to insert extra snare drum notes (not just on the 2 & 4 backbeats, but in a musically interesting, groove-supporting way). I'll try to keep the groove balanced, not overcrowding with snares, but clearly adding more presence.

**Here’s the plan:**
- The original snare is already syncopated and uses a mix of soft and open hits.
- I will add extra snare hits, especially ghost notes (soft snare hits, represented as "o" or "s"), to fill in empty spaces and give a groove reminiscent of funk or hip-hop.
- I’ll be careful not to clash with the existing hihat groove.

**Explanation:**  
- Added a soft snare ghost note ("o") on beat 1, 3rd 16th note of bar 1, which adds a bit of push to the groove.
- Added a soft snare ("o") right before the last strong snare in each bar, helping to lead into the backbeat.
- This should make the groove feel busier, funkier, and more dynamic, while not overpowering the main groove.
