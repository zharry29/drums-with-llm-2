The original groove is very sparse, with only some soft and hard closed ride hits on the bow and soft closed hihats on the off-beats. The request is to "comp with the bass guitar on each quarter note downbeat in a jazzy way."

In jazz drumming, comping typically involves supportive, syncopated hits on the snare and ride cymbal, and sometimes the hi-hat on the 2 and 4 beats. The kick drum usually plays on the downbeats or in a way that interacts with the walking bass.

Given the request to align with each quarter note downbeat (which are the 1, 2, 3, 4 beats of the bar), and keeping a jazzy feel, I will add:

- Kick drum on each quarter note downbeat (hard hits on 1,2,3,4).
- Snare drum playing light side-stick hits (x) on the off-beats to add texture but without overpowering.
- Ride cymbal maintains the existing alternating pattern but I will add occasional open bell hits on downbeats for jazzy character.
- Hi-hat closed hits on 2 and 4 to emphasize the backbeat as typical in jazz.
- Toms and crash cymbals remain unused to keep it light and groovy.

Now let's build the final groove:

K: O---|O---|O---|O---
S: ----|x---|----|x---
H: ----|x---|----|x---  (keep original hi-hats on 2 and 4)
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|X-x-|O---|X-x-  (add open bell rides on downbeats)

This groove hits the bass with kick on quarter note downbeats, and comping with snares and ride cymbal, keeping hi-hat tight. It should be a nice jazzy comp.

Here is the final groove in notation:
