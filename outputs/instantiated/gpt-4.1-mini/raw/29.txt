Double time means the rhythm should feel twice as fast, or twice as many hits per bar compared to the original.

In the original groove, the ride cymbal plays on the 1st 16th note of the first beat (x---), and then a pattern on the 2nd beat (X-x-), then again on the 3rd beat (x---) and the 4th beat (X-x-).

Hihat plays softly closed on the 2nd and 4th beats on the first 16th note.

To make this double time, I need to double the number of hits in the bar. Essentially, the current 16 16th notes per bar turn into 32 16th notes in double time. But since we're limited to the same bar length with 16 16th notes in the notation, what is generally done is that the new double-time pattern fits into the same 16 slots, but the note density replicates the original pattern's subdivision doubled.

So I will create a groove with twice as many hits but keep the measure length.

Given the original ride rhythm:

- Beats 1: x---
- Beat 2: X-x-
- Beat 3: x---
- Beat 4: X-x-

In double time, we would expect ride hits roughly twice as dense.

Similarly for hihat on beats 2 and 4.

I will increase the note density accordingly, making the ride and hihat play both on 16th notes and 32nd notes to represent double time.

Because the notation only supports 16 16th notes, I will represent the "double time" feel by placing hits on every 8th note slot, and fill in with 16th note placements to simulate it.

Let's adapt:

- Ride: original hits at 1,5,6,7,9,13,14,15 â€” let's double the hits by also adding hits in between.

I will do:

R: x-xXxXx-xXxXx-

Hihat originally on 2nd and 4th beat first 16th note (positions 5,13 with x).

I will space hihat hits twice as dense: on every 2nd 16th note from 5 and 13.

So for H : from x--- at pos5, and x--- at pos13, become for example, xx--xx--xx--xx--

But 16 notes only, so I can do: x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-

Now let's write the final groove.

Since the original only had ride and hihat played, kick, snare, tom, crash remain silent.
