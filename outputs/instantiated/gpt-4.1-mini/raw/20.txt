To make the groove more funky, I will add some syncopation and ghost notes, which are common in funk drumming. I'll add some softer kick hits to create a groove, add some ghost snare hits for a more complex rhythm, and alternate the hihat between closed and open to give it more groove and movement.

Here's what I'll do:
- Kick drum (K): Add some soft kicks in between to create a syncopated feel.
- Snare (S): Add ghost notes on the "e" and "a" 16th notes (soft hits), keep the main backbeat on 2 and 4.
- Hihat (H): Alternate between closed (x) and open (o) notes to give the groove more life.
- Keep the toms, crash, and ride unchanged (resting).

Let's compose this:

K: O--o|--o-|O-o-|----
S: ----|O--o|x--o|O---
H: x--x|xoox|x-ox|x--o
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Now formatting correctly with the bars:

Bar 1: O--o|--o-|O-o-|----
K:  O - - o | - - o - | O - o - | - - - -  
S:  - - - - | O - - o | x - - o | O - - -  
H:  x - - x | x o o x | x - o x | x - - o  
T:  - - - - | - - - - | - - - - | - - - -  
C:  - - - - | - - - - | - - - - | - - - -  
R:  - - - - | - - - - | - - - - | - - - -  

It looks good and funky now.
