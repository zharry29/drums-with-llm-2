To make the drum groove sound more disco, common elements to add include:

- A steady and driving hi-hat pattern, often with open hi-hat on off-beats.
- Kick on every beat or on the important beats (four on the floor).
- Snare on beats 2 and 4.
- Adding some ghost notes or softer hits for groove and funkiness.

Current groove:
- Kick on beat 1 and 3 of bar 1 and bar 3.
- Snare on beat 2 and 4 of bar 2 and bar 4.
- Closed hi-hat on beat 1 of each bar.

For disco feel:
- Kick on all four beats (four on the floor).
- Consistent 8th-note closed hi-hat (soft hits) with open hi-hats on the "and" of 2 and 4.
- Snare on 2 and 4 (hard hits).
- Maybe some extra ghost snare notes for groove.

Let's create the edited groove:

Kick (K): O---|O---|O---|O---
Snare (S): ----|O---|----|O---
Actually snare on beats 2 and 4 means positions 4 and 12 (0-based indexing).
Positions 4 and 12 in 16 steps: 4th 16th note and 12th 16th note.

Positions counting from 0:
Beat 1: position 0
Beat 2: position 4
Beat 3: position 8
Beat 4: position 12

So snare O on position 4 and 12.

Hi-hat closed soft hits on 8th notes: positions 2, 6, 10, 14 (the +2 from each beat).

Also open hi-hat on the "and" of 2 and 4 means open hi-hat on positions 6 and 14.

We can use lowercase o for soft open hi-hat, X for hard closed hi-hat.

Summary for hi-hat:
- Closed (soft) on the downbeats: positions 0, 4, 8, 12 (maybe soft closed or hard closed? Disco often has hard closed steady beats)
- Open on "and" of 2 and 4: positions 6, 14.

Better to have hard closed hits on off beats (positions 0,4,8,12), soft open hi-hat on 6,14.

So patterns:
Hi-hat: X-X-o-X---X-o-X--- (fitting to 16 notes)

Let's build each line in 16 chars:

Kick:
Positions 0,4,8,12 = O, else -

Kick: O---|O---|O---|O---

Snare:
Positions 4, 12 = O, others -

Snare: ----|O---|----|O---

Hi-hat:
Positions 0,2,4,8,10,12 = X (hard closed)
Positions 6,14 = o (soft open)
Positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15 = -

Counting to fill 16 characters:

Positions:

0 - X  
1 - -  
2 - X  
3 - -  
4 - X  
5 - -  
6 - o  
7 - -  
8 - X  
9 - -  
10 - X  
11 - -  
12 - X  
13 - -  
14 - o  
15 - -

=> "X-X-X-o-X-X-X-o-"

Wait this is 17 characters, we need 16 only.

Corrected:

"X-X-oX--X-X-oX---"

Let's write carefully:

Pos 0: X  
1: -  
2: X  
3: -  
4: o (soft open hi-hat on beat 2 downbeat? No, open on "and" of 2 is pos 6)
Let's be sure,

Positions and 16th notes:

0: beat 1 downbeat  
1: beat 1 16th note 2  
2: beat 1 16th note 3  
3: beat 1 16th note 4  
4: beat 2 downbeat  
5: beat 2 2nd 16th  
6: beat 2 3rd 16th ("and" of 2)  
7: beat 2 4th 16th  
8: beat 3 downbeat  
9: beat 3 2nd 16th  
10: beat 3 3rd 16th ("and" of 3)  
11: beat 3 4th 16th  
12: beat 4 downbeat  
13: beat 4 2nd 16th  
14: beat 4 3rd 16th ("and" of 4)  
15: beat 4 4th 16th  

Open hi-hat on "and" of 2 and 4 = positions 6 and 14

So:

Pos: Sound  
0: X (closed)  
1: -  
2: X (closed)  
3: -  
4: X (closed)  
5: -  
6: o (open)  
7: -  
8: X (closed)  
9: -  
10: X (closed)  
11: -  
12: X (closed)  
13: -  
14: o (open)  
15: -

Make a string:

0:X  
1:-  
2:X  
3:-  
4:X  
5:-  
6:o  
7:-  
8:X  
9:-  
10:X  
11:-  
12:X  
13:-  
14:o  
15:-

=> "X-X-X-o-X-X-X-o-"

Count characters: 16.

Yes, this is perfect.

Toms, Crash, Ride: keep empty

Final groove:

K: O---|O---|O---|O---  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X-X-|X-o-|X-X-|X-o-  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

Actually, each 4-character segment needs 4 chars, let's check above with spaces:

Hi-hat line:

"X-X-" | "X-o-" | "X-X-" | "X-o-"

That's 4 groups of 4 chars each = 16 chars total.

This is consistent.
