The original groove has the Kick (K) pattern as:  
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
This means there are hits on many 16th notes, but there are also some rests.

The request is to "fill up the whole bar with double kick," which means the Kick drum should be played on every 16th note in the bar with hard hits (O), so there are no rests in the Kick line for the entire 16 notes.

So the new Kick line should be all Os:  
K: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

The other lines (Snare, Hihat, Toms, Crash, Ride) remain unchanged.

Here's the new groove:  
K: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

I'll reinsert the bars and keep the vertical bars for readability: every 4 characters add a | except at the edges.

New Kick line: OOOO|OOOO|OOOO|OOOO

Final notation format:
