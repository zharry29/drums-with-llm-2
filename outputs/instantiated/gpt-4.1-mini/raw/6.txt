The original groove has snare hits as hard head hits "O" on the 2nd and 4th beats:

S: ----|O---|----|O---

The request is to change all snare hits to sidesticks. A hard sidestick hit is denoted by "X."

So, the snare line should become:

S: ----|X---|----|X---

No other changes are requested, so everything else remains the same.

Final drum groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|X---|----|X---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
