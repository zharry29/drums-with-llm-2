The original groove has the hihat played on each first 16th note of every beat with a hard closed hit "X". The request is to replace the hihat with toms. 

So, I will remove all the hihat hits and move them to the toms line instead, preserving the pattern and articulation. The toms will adopt the "X" from the hihat, but since the toms articulation uses only capital "O" and lowercase "o" for hard and soft hits, I'll translate the hard closed hit on hihat (X) to a hard hit (O) on toms.

The resulting groove will have the same rhythmic pattern but with toms playing in place of hihat.

Here's the new drum groove:
