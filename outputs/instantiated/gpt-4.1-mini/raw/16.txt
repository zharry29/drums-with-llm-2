Let's analyze the request and the original groove.

Original groove:
- The hihat (H) is silent on all notes.
- The ride cymbal (R) is hitting on 8th notes (positions 1, 3, 5, 7... counting 16th notes), with a pattern "o-O-", meaning soft open bell, hard open bell...
- The request wants:
  - Closed hihat on all 8th notes (positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15)
  - Open hihat on every up beat. In 8th note subdivisions, the "up beats" are the "and" beats, that is the second 8th note of each quarter note beat: positions 3, 7, 11, 15.
  - All hits hard.
  
So to translate:
- For positions 1, 5, 9, 13 (downbeats of beats 1, 2, 3, 4), the hihat should be closed hard: "X"
- For positions 3, 7, 11, 15 (upbeats), the hihat should be opened hard: "O"

Let's create the new hihat line by placing "X" at 1,5,9,13, and "O" at 3,7,11,15. The rest are "-".

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ... 16

Thus:

1: X  
2: -  
3: O  
4: -  
5: X  
6: -  
7: O  
8: -  
9: X  
10: -  
11: O  
12: -  
13: X  
14: -  
15: O  
16: -

New Hihat line: "X-O-X-O-X-O-X-O-"

Now I will keep all other lines same from original groove.

Final groove:
