To add more low frequency sounds, I will focus on increasing the use of the Kick drum (K), as it generally produces the lowest frequencies on a drum set. The current groove has two kicks on the 1st and 3rd beats. I will add some extra kicks on the 2nd and 4th beats, using soft hits (o) to keep it balanced and groove-like instead of overpowering. This should add more body to the groove with low frequencies while maintaining the original rhythmic pattern.

Here is the edited groove:
