The original groove starts with a kick drum hit (K: OOO-) and a crash cymbal hit (C: O---) right at the first 16th note of the bar. The snare, hihat, toms, and ride cymbal are silent there.

The request is to add a kick hit and ride drum at the very beginning. There is already a kick hit at the first note, so that part is fulfilled.

Next, I need to add a ride drum hit at the very beginning, which means at the first 16th note.

The ride cymbal notation uses capital "O" for a hard open bell hit, lowercase "o" for soft bell, and "X" or "x" for closed hits on the bow. Since the request does not specify the articulation, I will add a hard open bell hit (O) for a clear presence.

So, at the first character of the ride line, replace the "-" with an "O".

I will otherwise keep the groove unchanged.
