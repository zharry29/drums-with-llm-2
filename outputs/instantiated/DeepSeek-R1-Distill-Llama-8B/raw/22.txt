Alright, I need to edit the drum groove to make it sound more like a metal groove. Let's see what the current groove looks like.

First, looking at the Kick drum (K): It's currently O---|---o|O-O-|----. That means on the first beat, it's a hard hit, then a soft hit, then a hard hit on the third beat, and a single hard hit on the fourth. For a metal feel, the kick should be more aggressive and consistent, maybe double kicks on every downbeat. So I'll change it to O---|---O|---O|---O, keeping the hard hits and adding some soft hits in between to give it that punchy metal sound.

Next, the Snare drum (S): It's currently ----|O---|----|O---. That's a hard hit on every downbeat and a soft hit on the upbeats. To make it more metal, snare drums often have fast, tight hits. Maybe adding some extra hits on the upbeats with X for hard sidesticks. So I'll change it to ----|X---|----|X---, giving it a snappy feel.

The Hihat (H): It's currently --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-. That's a soft open hit on the first beat, then a hard open, then a soft open, and so on. For metal, the hihat should be more active, maybe with some closed hits (x) to add texture. I'll switch it to x---|x---|x---|x---, using closed hits on every note to create a more dynamic and aggressive sound.

The Tom-toms (T) and Crash cymbal (C): They're not playing much in the current groove. In metal, toms and crashes are often used for fills and solos. I'll add some tom hits on beats 2 and 3, and some crash hits on the 3rd and 4th beats to give the groove more energy.

The Ride cymbal (R): It's not playing in the current groove. Ride cymbals are common in metal for their bright, cutting sound. I'll add X---|X---|X---|X---, using closed hits on every note to create a sharp, ride-like sound that cuts through the mix.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have a consistent, aggressive kick pattern, a snappy snare with sidesticks, active hihat with closed hits, tom fills, crash accents, and a sharp ride cymbal. This should give the groove a more metal edge with energy and dynamics.
