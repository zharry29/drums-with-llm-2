Alright, so I need to add some ghost notes on the Snare drum in this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The drum groove provided has four beats, each consisting of 16 notes. The Snare drum is represented by the 'S' line, and currently, it's only playing on the 3rd note of the first beat, the 1st note of the second beat, and the 3rd note of the fourth beat. 

First, I need to figure out where exactly the ghost notes should be added. Ghost notes are usually played subtly, often as open hits or sidesticks, and they don't replace the existing notes but rather add to the rhythm. Looking at the current Snare pattern, it's pretty straightforward with just a few notes. To add ghost notes, I can introduce additional open hits or sidesticks that don't interfere with the main pattern.

Let me break it down beat by beat. 

**Beat 1:** The Snare is playing on the 3rd note. I can add a ghost note on the 1st or 5th note of this beat. Since the 1st note is usually a downbeat, adding a ghost note there might be too prominent. Maybe adding it on the 5th note would be subtler. 

**Beat 2:** The Snare is playing on the 1st note. Adding a ghost note here could be on the 3rd note, which is a backbeat. It might feel natural without being too overwhelming. 

**Beat 3:** The Snare isn't playing here. Maybe adding a ghost note on the 1st note of this beat could help fill in the empty space without making it too busy. 

**Beat 4:** The Snare is playing on the 3rd note. Similar to beat 1, adding a ghost note on the 5th note here could work well. 

Now, considering the notation system, each line is separated by |, and each group of four characters represents a beat. I need to insert additional characters in the Snare line without disrupting the existing structure.

Let me sketch out the changes:

- **Beat 1 (First |):** Currently, the third position is 'o'. I'll add an 'o' at the fifth position.
- **Beat 2 (Second |):** Currently, the first position is 'o'. I'll add an 'o' at the third position.
- **Beat 3 (Third |):** Currently, nothing is playing. I'll add an 'o' at the first position.
- **Beat 4 (Fourth |):** Currently, the third position is 'o'. I'll add an 'o' at the fifth position.

This should add subtle ghost notes without overwhelming the existing pattern. I'll make sure to keep the notation clean and within the provided structure.
