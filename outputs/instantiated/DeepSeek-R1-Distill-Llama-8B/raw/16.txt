Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. Let me start by understanding what's being asked. The user provided a drum notation and a specific groove, and they want me to modify it by adding closed hihat notes on all 8th notes while keeping the upbeats as open hihats, and all hits should be hard.

First, I'll look at the current groove to see how it's structured. The bar is divided into four beats, each represented by four characters between the | symbols. Each character corresponds to a 16th note. The instruments are Kick, Snare, Hihat, Tom, Crash, and Ride.

The user's request is to play closed hihat on every 8th note, which I think refers to the 8th 16th note in each beat. But I'm a bit confused about how the 8th note falls within each beat. In drum notation, each beat is four 16th notes, so the 8th note would be the second note in each beat. So, in each beat, the second note should be a closed hihat, and the first, third, and fourth notes should be open hihats.

Looking at the current Hihat line, it's mostly x---, which I believe is closed hihat, but the user wants to change this. Wait, no, in the current groove, the Hihat is x---, which is closed on the first note and open on the subsequent ones. But the user wants the opposite: closed on the 8th note (second note of each beat) and open on the upbeats.

So, I need to adjust the Hihat pattern. The current pattern is x---|x---|x---|x---, which means the first note is closed, and the rest are open. But the user wants the second note (8th in the bar) to be closed, so I need to switch that. So, the first beat should have x---, the second beat should have -x--, the third beat should have x---, and the fourth beat should have -x--. But wait, that might not fit the notation correctly. Each beat is four 16th notes, so each section between | is a beat.

Wait, no, each | separates beats. So, the first four characters before the first | are the first beat, then the next four are the second beat, and so on. So, the 8th note is the second note in the second beat. So, in the second beat, the second note should be closed hihat.

So, the Hihat line should be: x---|x---|x---|x--- for the first beat, then in the second beat, it should be x---|---x|---x|---x? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Each beat is four notes, so the second beat's notes would be the 5th to 8th 16th notes. So, the 8th note is the second note in the second beat.

Therefore, in the second beat, the second note (8th in the bar) should be closed hihat. So, the second beat should be: x---|---x|---x|---x. Wait, but that would make the second note closed and the rest open. But the user wants all hits hard, so maybe all x's? No, because the user specified to keep the upbeats as open hihats. So, in the second beat, the second note is closed, and the first, third, and fourth notes are open.

So, the Hihat line would be: x---|---x|---x|---x. But I'm not sure if that's the correct way to represent it. Maybe it's x---|---x|---x|---x, where the second note is closed.

Wait, but in the original notation, x--- represents a closed hihat on the first note, and then open on the subsequent notes. So, to have the second note closed, I need to adjust that. Maybe it should be ---x for the second beat's second note.

So, the Hihat line would be: x---|---x|---x|---x. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct way to denote it. Maybe I should look at the example given in the initial explanation.

In the initial example, the Hihat line was x---|x---|x---|x---, which means closed on the first note and open on the rest. So, to have closed on the second note of the second beat, I need to adjust the second beat's second note to be closed, while keeping the first, third, and fourth notes open.

So, the second beat would be: ---x instead of x---. Wait, no, that would mean the first note is open and the second is closed. But I think the user wants the second note (8th in the bar) to be closed, regardless of the upbeats. So, in the second beat, the second note is closed, and the first, third, and fourth notes are open.

Therefore, the Hihat line would be: x---|---x|---x|---x. So, first beat: x---, second beat: ---x, third beat: ---x, fourth beat: ---x. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm mixing up the beats.

Each | separates beats, so the first four characters are beat 1, next four are beat 2, etc. So, in beat 2, the second note (8th in the bar) should be closed. So, in beat 2, the notes would be: first note (5th 16th): open, second note (6th 16th): closed, third note (7th 16th): open, fourth note (8th 16th): open.

Wait, no, the user said to play closed hihat on every 8th note, which is the second note of each beat. So, in each beat, the second note should be closed. So, beat 1: first note open, second note closed, third note open, fourth note open. Beat 2: same. So, the Hihat line would be: x---|---x|---x|---x.

But in the initial example, the Hihat was x---|x---|x---|x---, which is closed on the first note and open on the rest. So, to have closed on the second note, I need to adjust that. So, beat 1: x---, beat 2: ---x, beat 3: ---x, beat 4: ---x. Wait, that would mean all beats after the first have open on the first note and closed on the second. But the user wants every 8th note (second note of each beat) to be closed, so maybe all beats should have the second note closed.

So, the Hihat line would be: x---|---x|---x|---x. That way, each beat's second note is closed, and the first, third, and fourth notes are open.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Maybe I should check the notation again. Each | separates beats, so each four-character section is a beat. Each character represents a 16th note. So, in each beat, the notes are 1, 2, 3, 4 (16th, 32nd, 48th, 64th notes). The 8th note would be the second note in the second beat.

So, in the second beat, the second note (8th in the bar) should be closed. So, beat 2: first note (5th 16th): open, second note (6th 16th): closed, third note (7th 16th): open, fourth note (8th 16th): open.

Therefore, the Hihat line should be: x---|---x|---x|---x.

So, putting it all together, the Hihat line would be: x---|---x|---x|---x.

I think that's how it should be. Now, I'll apply this change to the groove and make sure all other instruments remain the same.
