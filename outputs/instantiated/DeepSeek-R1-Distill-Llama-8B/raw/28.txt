Alright, I need to figure out how to add a bass guitar part to the drum groove based on the user's request. The user wants the bass to be played on each quarter note downbeat in a jazzy style. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should recall the drum notation provided. Each line in the notation corresponds to a different instrument, including Kick, Snare, Hihat, Tom, Crash, and Ride. The user is asking to add a bass guitar part, so I'll need to introduce a new line for the bass.

In the current groove, there's no bass line, so I'll need to add it. The user specified that the bass should be played on each quarter note downbeat, which are the first and fourth notes of each bar. Additionally, the style should be jazzy, which typically involves a walking bass line with roots, thirds, and maybe some chromaticism.

Looking at the existing drum groove, each bar has four beats, each consisting of 16th notes. The first and fourth beats are downbeats, so the bass should be played on those. I'll need to decide on the notes for the bass line, making sure they fit a jazzy progression.

Let me think about a possible bass line. Maybe something like a blues scale or a minor pent scale. For example, starting with a D minor root, the bass can go D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D. That's a common walking bass line in jazz.

So, for each bar, the bass will play D on the first downbeat, E on the second, F on the third, G on the fourth downbeat, and so on. I'll need to represent this using the notation provided.

In the notation, each instrument's line has characters representing notes. The characters are: O for a hard hit, o for a soft hit, X for a hard sidestick, x for a soft sidestick, etc. Since the bass isn't a standard drum part, I'll need to use a different symbol, perhaps B for bass notes.

Now, I need to map the bass notes to the drum notation. Each character in a line represents a 16th note, so I'll need to indicate the bass notes on the appropriate beats. Since the bass is only played on the downbeats (first and fourth beats), I'll place the bass characters on those positions.

Let me draft the bass line for the first bar:

Bar 1:
- Beat 1 (downbeat): D (O)
- Beat 2: E (O)
- Beat 3: F (O)
- Beat 4 (downbeat): G (O)

So, the bass line would be: O---|---|---|---O

But wait, that's a bit too simple. Maybe I can add some variation. In a jazzy bass line, there's often a walking pattern with minor seconds. So, perhaps:

Bar 1:
- Beat 1: D (O)
- Beat 2: E (O)
- Beat 3: F (O)
- Beat 4: G (O)

Bar 2:
- Beat 1: A (O)
- Beat 2: B (O)
- Beat 3: C (O)
- Beat 4: D (O)

This continues the walking bass pattern. I'll need to make sure the notes are placed correctly in the notation.

Now, I'll add this bass line to the existing drum groove. Each instrument's line will be separated, and the bass will be the last line.

Finalizing the groove with the bass line added:

K: o---|----|o---|----  
S: ----|----|----|----  
H: x---|----|x---|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-  
B: O---|---|---|---O  

Wait, that doesn't look right. The bass line should be on the downbeats, so maybe:

B: O---|---|---|---O

But I need to ensure that the bass is only played on the first and fourth beats. Perhaps using different symbols or spacing to indicate the downbeats.

Alternatively, using the notation to show the bass notes only on the downbeats, maybe:

B: O---|---|---|---O

This way, the bass is only active on the first and fourth beats, matching the quarter note downbeats.

I think this should work. The bass is now added in a jazzy walking pattern, complementing the existing drum groove.
