Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. The user provided a drum notation and a current groove, and the edit request is to make sure there are no more than 8 notes in the entire groove. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I should understand the current groove structure. The bar has four beats, each represented by four characters before the |. Each instrument line corresponds to a specific drum part. The user wants the total number of notes across all instruments to be no more than 8. That means across Kick, Snare, Hihat, Tom, Crash, and Ride, the total notes should be ≤8.

Looking at the current K: line, it's O--O|----|--O-|----. That's 3 'O's and 1 '-' in each beat, so 3*4 = 12 notes. That's way over. Similarly, S: has Oo-o|-o--|O--o, which is 3 'O's and 1 'o', so 3*4=12 notes. H: is X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-, so each beat has X and x, that's 2*4=8 notes. T: and C: are all '-', so 0 notes. R: is ----|----|----|----, so 0 notes.

Total notes: 12 (K) +12 (S) +8 (H) +0 (T) +0 (C) +0 (R) = 32 notes. That's way too many. The user wants ≤8, so I need to reduce this significantly.

I need to remove notes from K, S, and H. Let's start with K. Maybe make it just O on the first and third beats, and '-' elsewhere. So O--O|----|--O-|----. That's 2 'O's, so 2*4=8 notes. Wait, that's still 8, but the user said no more than 8. Maybe make it O--O|----|---|----, which is 2 'O's, so 8 notes. But that's still 8, so maybe reduce by one. So O--O|----|---|---- would be 7 notes. Hmm, but maybe the user means per beat, but the instruction isn't clear. I'll go with 8 total.

Next, S: currently has 12 notes. Maybe reduce it to 0. So all '-' across S: ----|----|----|----. That would save 12 notes.

H: currently has 8 notes. Maybe reduce it to 0 as well. So all '-' across H: -----|-----|-----|-----.

T: already 0, so keep as is.

C: already 0, so keep as is.

R: already 0, so keep as is.

Now, total notes: K:8, S:0, H:0, T:0, C:0, R:0. Total=8. That meets the user's request.

I should adjust K to have 2 'O's, and S, H, T, C, R all as '-'. So the edited groove would have K: O--O|----|---|----, S: ----|----|----|----, H: -----|-----|-----|-----, T: ----|----|----|----, C: ----|----|----|----, R: ----|----|----|----.

Let me double-check: K has 2 'O's, each beat has 4 notes, so 2*4=8. S, H, T, C, R all have 0 notes. Total=8. Perfect.

I think that's it. Now, I'll present the final edited groove as per the user's instruction.
