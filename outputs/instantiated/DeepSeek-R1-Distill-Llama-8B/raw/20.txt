Alright, so I need to edit this drum groove to make it sound more funky. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the notation system.

First, the drum notation uses bars with each instrument's line representing their part. The Kick drum (K) is on the first line, Snare (S) on the second, Hihat (H) on the third, Tom (T) on the fourth, Crash cymbal (C) on the fifth, and Ride cymbal (R) on the sixth.

Each character represents a 16th note, and every four characters separated by | make a beat. So, each bar has four beats. If a character is '-', it means the instrument isn't played on that note.

Now, the original groove is:

K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

From this, I can see that the Kick drum has a hard hit on the first and third beats, and the Hihat is playing closed hits on every note.

The Snare has a soft hit on the first and fourth beats, and the Ride cymbal is only playing on the fourth beat.

To make it sound more funky, I should add more dynamic elements. Funk usually involves offbeat accents and a more rhythmic, groovy feel. Maybe adding some ghost notes or varying the accents can help achieve that.

Looking at the Snare drum line, it's currently playing on beats 1 and 4. Maybe adding a ghost note on beat 3 would add some texture. Ghost notes are played softly and aren't always noticeable, which can add depth to the groove.

For the Ride cymbal, it's only playing on beat 4. Adding a ghost note on beat 1 and 3 could create a more layered and rhythmic feel. Additionally, varying the Ride cymbal between open and closed hits can add dynamics.

The Tom and Crash cymbal lines are currently inactive. Adding some activity here, like a soft hit on Tom on beat 2 and a ghost note on Crash on beat 4, could add more layers and a fuller sound.

On the Kick drum, the original has hard hits on beats 1 and 3. Maybe varying between hard and soft hits on these beats can create a more dynamic kick pattern, giving the groove a more funk feel.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust each instrument's line to add these elements:

- **Kick Drum (K):** Alternate between hard and soft hits on beats 1 and 3.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Add a ghost note on beat 3.
- **Hihat (H):** Keep the closed hits but maybe add an open hit here or there for variation.
- **Tom (T):** Add a soft hit on beat 2.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Add a ghost note on beat 4.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Add ghost notes on beats 1 and 3, and vary between open and closed hits.

This should make the groove more dynamic and add the necessary funk elements by introducing ghost notes and varying accents across different instruments.
