Alright, so I need to figure out how to make this drum groove double time. Let me start by understanding what double time means in drum notation. From what I remember, each beat in the notation is a 16th note, and four beats make up a bar. So, if I want to make it double time, I guess that means each beat is now a 16th note, but the timing is compressed. Hmm, that might mean that the timing between the beats is shorter, making the overall feel faster.

Looking at the current groove, I see that the right hand (ride cymbal) is using X and x notation, which I think represents the articulation. The left hand (hihat) is using x and o, which I believe affects the type of hit. The kick drum is using o, which is a soft hit, and the snare drum is not playing anything except for the first note.

The edit request is to make this double time. So, I need to adjust the timing so that the notes come faster. That probably means shortening the spacing between the notes. But how exactly do I do that in the notation? Each | separates beats, so maybe I need to reduce the number of characters between the | to make the notes come quicker.

Let me look at the ride cymbal part first. The current ride is x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-. This seems to be a pattern where each X is a hard hit and x is a soft hit. To make it double time, I might need to add more X and x in each beat section. But I'm not entirely sure how to represent that in the notation.

For the hihat, it's currently ----|x---|----|x---. This means that on beats 1 and 3, there's an x (closed hihat), and on beats 2 and 4, it's open. To double the time, I might need to add more notes in between. Maybe inserting more x and o in each beat.

The kick drum is o---|----|o---|----, which is a soft hit on beats 1 and 3. To make it double time, perhaps I can make the o's come more frequently or have shorter gaps between them.

The snare drum is currently not playing on the first beat but is on beats 2 and 4. To add more snare, I might need to include O or X on more notes, but the user didn't specify adding snare, just making it double time.

I'm also thinking about the overall structure. Each four characters between | make a beat. So, if I can make each section between | have more notes, that would speed up the tempo. For example, instead of having one note per beat, have two or three notes, which would imply a faster tempo.

Let me try adjusting the ride cymbal first. Instead of X---|X-x-|x---|X-x-, maybe I can make it X---|X---|X---|X---. That way, each beat has a hard hit, making it more continuous and faster.

For the hihat, instead of having x on beats 1 and 3, maybe I can have x on every beat but alternate between open and closed. So, x---|x---|x---|x---. That would mean every beat has a hihat, which could give it a busier, faster feel.

The kick drum is currently o---|----|o---|----. To make it double time, maybe I can have o---|----|o---|---- but with shorter gaps. Or perhaps use o---|o---|o---|o--- to have a continuous soft kick.

The crash cymbal and toms are not playing in this groove, so I might need to keep them as is unless the edit request specifies changes for them.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust each instrument to have more notes in each beat section, thereby increasing the tempo. I'll make sure that the notation reflects more activity in each beat to achieve the double time feel.

I should also be careful with the notation rules, making sure that each four characters between | correctly represent a beat. I don't want to overcrowd the beats to the point where it's unreadable. It's a balance between making it faster and keeping it clear.

After adjusting, I'll review the changes to ensure that the groove flows well and maintains a consistent double time feel across all instruments. This should meet the user's request to make the beat double time.
