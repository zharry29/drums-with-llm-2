Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a drum groove and an edit request. The goal is to modify the groove according to the request and present the final result in the specified notation. 

First, I'll examine the original drum groove provided:

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

In this groove:
- **Kick (K):** Has a soft hit on the first note of each beat and a soft hit on the second note of beats 2 and 4.
- **Snare (S):** Has a hard sidestick on the third note of beats 2 and 4.
- **Hihat (H):** Has soft closed hits on the second and fourth notes of beats 2 and 4.
- **Toms (T):** Not played.
- **Crash (C):** Not played.
- **Ride (R):** Has soft closed hits on the first and third notes of each beat, and hard closed hits on the second note of beats 2 and 4.

The edit request is: **"I want snare on every 16-th note in the second beat."**

To understand this request, I need to break down what it means. In drum notation:
- Each beat consists of four 16th notes, represented by four characters separated by `|`.
- The second beat is the second group of four characters after the first `|`.

So, the second beat in the original groove is `--o-` for the Snare, which means:
1. Note 1: Not played (`-`)
2. Note 2: Not played (`-`)
3. Note 3: Soft open hit (`o`)
4. Note 4: Not played (`-`)

The request is to have a snare on **every** 16th note in the second beat. This means that each of the four notes in the second beat should have a snare hit. 

Given the Snare drum's articulation options:
- `O`: Hard hit
- `o`: Soft open hit
- `X`: Hard sidestick
- `x`: Soft sidestick

The user didn't specify the type of hit, just that the snare should be on every 16th note. To keep it consistent with the original groove, which uses `X` for hard sidesticks on the Snare, I'll use `X` for all four notes in the second beat.

Now, I'll modify the Snare line in the second beat from `--X-|----` to `XXXX|----`.

Here's the modified groove:

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|XXXX|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

This modification ensures that the Snare is played on every 16th note in the second beat, fulfilling the user's request.
