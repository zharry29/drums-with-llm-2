Okay, the user wants more low frequency sounds in their drum groove. Let me think about which instruments contribute to low frequencies. The kick drum (K) is the primary low-end instrument, so maybe adding more kick hits or making them harder. The toms (T) also provide lower tones, so incorporating some tom hits could help. The snare (S) has a mid-range sound, so maybe not the best for low frequencies, but maybe using a softer hit there if needed.

Looking at the original groove:
- The kick is on beats 1 and 3, which is standard. To add more low end, maybe doubling the kick on some beats or adding ghost notes. Alternatively, introducing tom hits on offbeats to fill in the lower frequencies where the kick isn't present.
- The snare is on beats 2 and 4, which is typical for a backbeat. Since the user wants more lows, maybe keeping the snare as is but adding toms underneath.
- The hihat is closed on every beat, providing a steady rhythm but not low frequencies. Replacing some hihat hits with toms might help, but the user might want to keep the hihat's rhythm intact.

Possible approach:
1. Double the kick on some beats. For example, adding a second kick hit after the main one on beats 1 and 3. Since each beat is four 16th notes, maybe making the kick hit on the first and third 16th notes of the beat (like O-O- instead of O---).
2. Add tom hits on the offbeats where the hihat is playing. Since the hihat is on every beat's first 16th note, maybe placing toms on the "and" of each beat (the second 16th note) to fill in the lower end without clashing.
3. Ensure that the kick remains the primary low element but enhance it with toms where appropriate.

Let me check the notation rules. For the kick, using O for hard hits. Toms use O and o as well. Since the user wants more low frequencies, using hard hits (O) on toms would be better. 

Original K line: O---|----|O---|----
Changing to double kick on beats 1 and 3: Maybe O-O-|----|O-O-|----
That adds a second kick on the "and" of 1 and 3, making the kick busier but still keeping the main hits. 

For toms, since the hihat is on every beat's first 16th note, adding toms on the second 16th of each beat (the "&") could work. So T line would be something like -O--|-O--|-O--|-O-- but spread across the bar. Wait, each beat is four characters. Let's see:

Original hihat is X---|X---|X---|X--- (assuming each beat starts with X on the first 16th). To add toms on the "&", which is the second 16th of each beat, so positions 2, 6, 10, 14. So for Toms, the pattern would be -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--. But need to check if that's 16 notes. Each beat has four characters, so four beats would be 16. So T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--.

Alternatively, maybe a more consistent tom pattern. Let me structure it properly:

Breaking down each beat:
First beat (positions 1-4): O--- for kick. Adding a tom on the second 16th (position 2), so T would have -O-- in the first beat. Similarly for each beat.

So T line becomes: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O-- which would be "-O--| -O--| -O--| -O--" but with the | separators. Wait, in the notation, each four characters between | is a beat. So:

T: -O-- | -O-- | -O-- | -O--

But written as "-O--|-O--|-O--|-O--".

Alternatively, maybe a different pattern. Let me see if that's acceptable. The user wants more low-end, so adding toms on every second 16th note would add more low hits. Alternatively, maybe on every beat's second and fourth 16th notes, but need to not conflict with kick.

Alternatively, adding a tom on the third 16th note of each beat, but that might clash with the kick on the third 16th if the kick is already there. Let me look at the kick's new pattern:

If the kick is O-O- (first and third 16th notes of the beat), then the tom could be on the second and fourth. But fourth would be the end of the beat. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe making the toms on the "and" of each beat (second 16th note) and every other beat. But to maximize low frequencies, maybe consistent toms on the "&" of every beat.

So combining both changes:

Kick: O-O- | ---- | O-O- | ---- (since original kick is on 1 and 3, but maybe keep the original structure but double the kick on beats 1 and 3. Wait the original K is O---|----|O---|---- so first beat is O on first 16th, then three rests. To double it, maybe make it O-O- on the first beat (positions 1 and 3), but that would be O on 1 and 3. Wait, that might make the kick hit on 1 and 3 of each beat, but since the original is only on the first 16th of beats 1 and 3, maybe changing the kick to hit on both first and third 16th notes of those beats. So for the first beat (positions 1-4):

Original K: O--- (only first note hit)
Modified K: O-O- (first and third 16th notes hit), so O on 1 and 3.

Similarly, third beat (third group) would be O-O-.

So the K line becomes:

K: O-O- | ---- | O-O- | ---- 

Then the toms would add hits on the second 16th of each beat, so T: -O-- for each beat.

Putting it all together:

K: O-O-|----|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, but let's check if that's 16 characters. Each beat is four characters, four beats make 16. The T line as written would be "-O--|-O--|-O--|-O--", which is 16.

Alternatively, maybe the toms can be harder hits, so using O instead of o? Since T uses O for hard. So T: -O-- with O being hard.

Alternatively, maybe even more toms. Alternatively, adding a tom on the first 16th note as well, but that might clash with kick. Alternatively, the toms could be on the offbeats where the hihat is closed. 

Another idea: since the user wants more low frequencies, maybe adding a tom on the snare hits. The snare is on beat 2 and 4 (second and fourth beats). So on those beats, maybe adding a tom hit at the same time as the snare. But the snare is on the first 16th note of those beats. So for the second beat (beat 2), the snare is at position 5 (first 16th of beat 2). Adding a tom there as well would give a lower sound. 

Alternatively, doubling the snare with a tom, but that might be too much. Alternatively, adding a tom on the "and" of the snare beats. 

Hmm. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the user wants more kick hits. The original kick is only on beats 1 and 3. Making it a double-time kick, like O--- on every beat? But that might be too much. Or maybe a steady eighth note kick. Since each beat is four 16th notes, an eighth note is two 16ths. So a steady eighth kick would be O-O- | O-O- etc. But in the original, the kick is only on beats 1 and 3. 

Alternatively, adding a kick on every beat's first 16th, so four kicks total. That would make the kick more present. So K: O---|O---|O---|O--- 

But the original has kick only on 1 and 3, so maybe the user wants to keep that structure but add more. Alternatively, keeping the original kick but adding toms on the offbeats.

Alternatively, combining both ideas: keep the original kick hits on 1 and 3, but add a tom on every other 16th note where there's no kick or snare. 

Alternatively, making the tom play on all the 16th notes where hihat is, but with toms. Since hihat is on every first 16th of each beat, replacing some with toms. But the user said "more low frequency" so maybe keeping hihat but adding toms on the "&".

I think the best approach is to add tom hits on the second 16th of each beat (the "&"), which are currently rests. That would fill in the low end without clashing with existing hits. So Toms would be -O-- for each beat, leading to the T line as "-O--|-O--|-O--|-O--".

Additionally, maybe making the kick hits harder (they are already O, which is hard), so that's okay. 

So the final groove would have the kick as originally, but with toms adding low hits on every "&". That should increase the low frequencies without changing the main structure too much.
