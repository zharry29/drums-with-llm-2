Alright, let me tackle this edit request. The user wants snare on every 16th note in the second beat. Let's look at the original groove first.

The given drum groove is:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Breaking this down, each line represents an instrument, and each set of four characters separated by | is a beat. The second beat is the part after the first |. For the snare (S line), the second beat is "X---". The user wants every 16th note in that second beat to have a snare hit. Since each beat has four 16th notes, "X---" only has the first note hit. We need to change that to have all four notes played.

The S line's second beat should be "XXXX" if using hard sidestick hits (since X is a hard sidestick hit). Alternatively, maybe a mix of X and x (soft), but the original uses X here. The user didn't specify soft or hard, so sticking with X for consistency seems safe.

So modifying the S line's second beat from "X---" to "XXXX". The rest of the S line remains the same. Let me check the other instruments to ensure no conflicts, but since the request is only about the snare, others stay. Let me reconstruct the S line:

Original S line: ----|X---|--X-|----
After edit: ----|XXXX|--X-|----

Wait, but the third beat has "--X-", so after the second beat, the third is still "--X-". That's okay. Let me verify the total notes. The second beat now has four snare hits, which is every 16th note there. That should fulfill the request. Let me make sure the rest is correct. Kick, hihat, etc., remain as before. The user didn't mention changing other parts, so this should be the solution.
