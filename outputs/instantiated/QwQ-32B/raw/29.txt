Okay, let's tackle this request. The user wants to make the given drum groove "double time." From previous interactions, I remember that "double time" typically means increasing the tempo or making the rhythm feel twice as fast. But in drum notation terms, it might involve adding more notes to fit into the same bar, effectively making the groove busier or with quicker subdivisions.

Looking at the provided drum groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The kick (K) and snare (S) are silent except for some hihats (H) on beats 2 and 4 (the "x" on the third 16th note of those beats). The ride (R) has a pattern that's already somewhat active, with some closed hits (X) and open (x). 

The user wants to double time this. Since the original is likely in 4/4, doubling the time might mean converting quarter notes to eighth notes or eighth notes to sixteenth, but since the notation is already in 16th notes, maybe making the ride and hihats play on every 16th note instead of sparser. Alternatively, adding more notes to the existing instruments to fill in the gaps.

In the original ride pattern: "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-", each beat is four 16th notes. The first beat starts with an open hit on the first 16th, then three rests. The second beat has a closed hit on the first 16th, then rests, a closed hit on the third, and an open on the fourth. To double time, maybe making the ride play every 16th note with alternating open and closed hits. Also, the hihat is only playing on the third 16th of beats 2 and 4. To make it double time, perhaps the hihat should play on every 16th note as well, maintaining a steady closed hit.

Alternatively, since the original hihat is only on beats 2 and 4's third 16th, doubling time might mean adding more hihat hits. Let me think step by step.

First, the ride pattern. Original first beat: x---. To double time, maybe x-x- or xxxx? But considering the existing pattern, perhaps making it more consistent. Let's see the original ride's second beat: X-x-. If we want to make it double time, maybe turn that into X-X- or XxXx? Wait, the user's previous example of making a groove double time involved changing the hihat from X--- on each beat to X-X- (like in the previous answer where hihat became X-X-|X-X- etc). So maybe for double time, the hihat should be on every 8th note, which is every two 16th notes. Wait, in the prior example where the user said "Make this double time," the hihat was changed from X---|X--- etc to X-X-|X-X- etc. So that's adding a hit on every other 16th note, effectively doubling the density.

So applying that here:

Original Hihat line: ----|x---|----|x---
So in beats 2 and 4, the third 16th note has an x (closed hit). To double time, perhaps make the hihat play on every 8th note (every two 16th notes). So for each beat, split into four 16ths. To double time, maybe the hihat plays on the first and third 16th of each beat? Or every 16th?

Wait, the user's prior example when making double time changed X--- (for hihat on first 16th of each beat) to X-X- (so every other 16th). So perhaps here, the hihat needs to be more active.

Original H line here is only hitting on the third 16th of beats 2 and 4. To double time, maybe add more hits. Alternatively, since the user's previous double time request turned a hihat that was on the first 16th of each beat into X-X-, maybe here the hihat should be active on every 8th note.

Alternatively, since the ride is already doing some pattern, maybe the hihat should complement it. Let's look at the ride's current pattern:

R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Breaking it down per beat:

Beat 1: x - - -
Beat 2: X - x -
Beat 3: x - - -
Beat 4: X - x -

Hmm, that's a bit irregular. To double time, perhaps making the ride play on every 16th note with a consistent pattern, like alternating between open and closed hits. Maybe something like x-X-x-X- but need to fit into the notation.

Alternatively, the user's previous example when making a groove double time had the hihat going to X-X- on each beat. Let me check that previous answer.

In the user's earlier example where they had:

Original groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

And the edit request was to make it double time, the assistant changed the Hihat from X--- on each beat to X-X- on each beat. So each beat's hihat was split into four 16ths, and they played on the first and third 16th notes (X-X-). So that's doubling the density by adding a hit every 8th note.

So applying that here. The current hihat is only hitting on the third 16th of beats 2 and 4. To double time, the hihat should be playing on every 8th note (i.e., every two 16ths), so on the first and third 16th of each beat. However, since the original hihat is only on beats 2 and 4, maybe the user wants the hihat to be active throughout?

Alternatively, maybe the entire hihat pattern should be denser. Since the original hihat is sparse (only on beats 2 and 4, third 16th), doubling time might mean making it hit on every 8th note across all beats. So for each beat, the hihat would have X on the first and third 16th notes. Let's try that.

Original H line: ----|x---|----|x---

Changing to X-X- on each beat would make it:

H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

But the original had some x's only on beats 2 and 4. However, the user's instruction is to "make this double time," so maybe the hihat needs to be more active. Alternatively, keeping the existing hihat's placement but doubling their density. Hmm, perhaps the user wants the hihat to be played on every 8th note (so two hits per beat) instead of sparsely.

Also, the ride is currently doing some pattern. Let's see:

Original R line: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

To double time, perhaps making the ride also play on every 16th note. For example, turning the first beat's x--- into x-x- (so x on first and third 16th), but need to maintain the existing pattern's feel. Alternatively, the ride's pattern could be made more dense.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to keep the existing elements but make the tempo feel twice as fast, which in drum terms might involve doubling the subdivisions. Since the original is in 16th notes, doubling time could mean going to 32nd notes, but the notation here is fixed at 16th note resolution. So the practical approach is to make the existing instruments play twice as many notes in the same bar.

In the previous example where the user wanted double time, the assistant made the hihat play on every 8th note (two hits per beat) by using X-X- for each beat. Applying that here, the hihat's current sparse pattern (only on beats 2 and 4) would need to be filled in. Since the user's instruction is to "make this double time," perhaps the hihat should be active on every 8th note across all beats, not just beats 2 and 4.

So the Hihat line would change from:

H: ----|x---|----|x---

to

H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

But also, looking at the ride's pattern, maybe it should be adjusted too. The original ride has x on the first 16th of beat 1 and 3, and on beat 2 and 4, it's X- x - (so first 16th closed, third 16th open?). Wait, the ride's notation: 

First beat: x--- (open hit on first 16th)

Second beat: X-x- (closed on first, then open on third)

Third beat: x--- (open on first)

Fourth beat: X-x- (same as second)

To make this double time, maybe making the ride also play on every 8th note. For example, on beat 1, instead of x---, perhaps x-x- (open on 1st and 3rd 16th). Similarly, beat 2's X-x- could become X-X- (closed on 1st and 3rd). But need to see if that maintains the intended feel.

Alternatively, the ride could alternate between closed and open hits more frequently. Let's try modifying both H and R to have hits on every 8th note (two per beat). 

So for Ride:

Original first beat: x--- → becomes x-x- (open on 1 and 3)

Second beat: X-x- → X-X- (closed on 1 and 3, but original had an open on 3? Hmm, maybe need to adjust. Wait original second beat's third 16th is x (open?), so perhaps to double time, the ride could be X-x- becomes XxXx? But need to fit into the four characters per beat.

Wait, each beat is four characters (16th notes). So for beat 2's original X-x-, which is X (closed on first 16th), then -, then x (open on third), then -.

To double time, perhaps making it XxXx? But that would be four hits. Alternatively, keeping the original's intent but denser.

Alternatively, the user might want the ride to play on every 16th note. For example, the first beat's x--- becomes x-x- (so two hits per beat). Similarly, the second beat's X-x- becomes X-X- (closed on first and third 16th), but the original had an open on the third. Hmm, perhaps that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the ride's pattern can be adjusted to have hits on all 16th notes but alternate between closed and open. For example, first beat: x-O- (but that might not fit). Alternatively, the user might prefer to keep the original ride's hits but add more in between. 

Alternatively, since the user's previous example just focused on the hihat when doubling time, maybe the main adjustment is to the hihat. Let's focus on that first.

So changing the hihat to X-X- on each beat, making it X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

Then the ride can stay as is, but perhaps the user also wants the ride to be denser. Alternatively, maybe the ride can be adjusted to have more hits. Let's see the original R line:

Original R:

Beat 1: x---
Beat 2: X-x-
Beat 3: x---
Beat 4: X-x-

If we double the density, maybe each beat's ride has two hits instead of one or two. For example, on beat 1, which originally has an open on the first 16th, maybe add another hit on the third, so x-x-. Similarly, beat 2's X-x- could become X-X- (closed on first and third), but original had an open on third. Alternatively, keep the original's X on first and x on third, but add a hit on the second 16th? But the user might not want that.

Alternatively, since the user's previous double time example only modified the hihat, maybe here we should only adjust the hihat. However, the original ride's pattern might already be suitable, but the hihat's sparsity might not fit a double time feel. 

Alternatively, the user might want the kick and snare to be involved, but the original K and S lines are all silent except for the hihat and ride. Since the user's instruction is to "make this double time," and the previous example focused on hihat, I'll proceed by modifying the hihat to X-X- on each beat. 

So the edited H line would be:

H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

But the original hihat had some x's only on beats 2 and 4. However, to make it double time, the hihat needs to be more consistent. 

Wait, the original H line was:

H: ----|x---|----|x---

So only on the third 16th of beats 2 and 4. To double time, perhaps the hihat should hit on every 8th note (two per beat) across all beats. That would mean:

Each beat's hihat is X-X- (closed on first and third 16th). So the entire H line becomes X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

This would make the hihat part double in density, contributing to the double time feel. 

Now, checking the ride. The original ride's first beat is x---, so if we leave it as is, it might clash with the denser hihat. Alternatively, the ride could also be adjusted. For example, on beat 1, if the hihat is X-X-, the ride's x on the first 16th would still be there, and perhaps add another hit on the third 16th. So x--- becomes x-x-.

Similarly, beat 2's X-x- could become X-X- (closed on first and third), but the original had an x (open) on the third. To preserve that, maybe X-x- becomes XxXx? But that's four hits. Alternatively, keep the original's third hit as open, so X-x- becomes X-x- but with an added hit on the second 16th? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ride should also be doubled in density. Let's try modifying the ride to have hits on every 8th note. 

Original R beats:

1: x---
2: X-x-
3: x---
4: X-x-

After doubling:

1: x-x-
2: X-X- (but original had an open on third, so maybe X-x- becomes X-x- but with an extra hit? Maybe X-Xx? Not sure. Alternatively, to maintain the original's closed on first and open on third, but add a closed on second? Hmm, perhaps the user's priority is hihat. 

Alternatively, the ride could stay as is but with the hihat's denser pattern. Since the user's previous example only changed hihat, maybe that's sufficient. 

Thus, the final edit would be changing the H line to X-X- across all beats, resulting in:

H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

And keeping the ride as original, unless further adjustments are needed. 

Wait, but the original ride's second beat is X-x-, which already has hits on first and third. So combining with the hihat's X on first and third would create a denser feel. That might work. 

So the final groove would be:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Wait, but the ride's first beat is still x--- (only first 16th). To make it more double time, maybe the ride should also have hits on every 8th note. Let me think again. If the user wants "double time," perhaps all elements should be denser. 

Alternatively, maybe the ride's pattern can be adjusted to have hits on every 8th note. For example:

Beat 1: x--- → x-x- (open on 1 and 3)
Beat 2: X-x- → X-X- (closed on 1 and 3, but original had an open on 3. So maybe X-x- stays, but to double time, add a hit on the second 16th? Not sure. Alternatively, the user might want the ride to play on every 16th note. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ride's pattern can be mirrored. Let's see:

Original R: x--- | X-x- | x--- | X-x-
Double time version could be x-x- | X-Xx | x-x- | X-Xx (but not sure). 

Alternatively, to keep the feel, the ride's first beat could have an open on first and third 16th (x-x-), second beat closed on first and third (X-X-), etc. 

If I adjust the ride's first beat to x-x- and third beat to x-x-, then:

R: x-x-|X-X-|x-x-|X-X-

But the original had an open on third 16th of beats 2 and 4. Hmm, perhaps that's acceptable. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the ride to stay as is but with the hihat denser. Since the user's previous example only changed hihat, I'll proceed with that. 

Thus, the final answer would have the H line changed to X-X- across all beats, and the ride remains the same. 

Wait, but the original hihat was only on beats 2 and 4. The user's instruction is to make the whole groove double time, so it's better to have consistent hihat across all beats. 

Therefore, the edited groove would have:

H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-
R remains as original.

So the final answer should be:

@@@
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

But wait, let me double-check the user's previous example. In the earlier "double time" request, the hihat went from X--- to X-X- on each beat. So following that pattern, yes, this should be correct.
