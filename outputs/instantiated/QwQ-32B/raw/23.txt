Okay, let's tackle this edit request. The user wants to make the given drum groove "double time." From the previous examples and the notation explanation, I know that each beat is made up of four 16th notes. Doubling the time might mean making the节奏 twice as fast, so perhaps converting each quarter note into eighth notes or adding more notes to fit into the same bar but at a faster pace.

Looking at the original groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

This is a simple 4/4 beat with kick on beats 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, and closed hi-hat on every quarter note. To make it double time, typically in drumming, that means playing twice as many notes in the same space. So instead of quarter notes, the hi-hat would be on eighth notes, and maybe the kick and snare patterns are adjusted to fit a faster rhythm.

In double time, the hi-hat usually moves to eighth notes, so instead of hitting every quarter note (four hits per bar), it would be every eighth note (eight hits per bar). Let me adjust the H line first. The original H line is X--- repeated four times (each | is a beat, so four beats total). To make it eighth notes, each beat would have two hits. So each beat's four 16th notes would become two eighth notes. Wait, actually, eighth notes are two 16th notes. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust each beat's four 16th notes to have two hits. Let me think.

Wait, the original H is X every quarter note. So in each beat, there's an X on the first 16th note. To make it double time, the hi-hat should be on every eighth note, so every two 16th notes. So each beat would have two hits. For example, instead of X--- (first 16th note), it would be XX-- (first and third 16th notes?), but actually, eighth notes in a beat are on 1 and 3 of the 16th notes. Wait, a quarter note is four 16th notes, so an eighth note is two 16th notes. So in each beat (four 16th notes), two eighth notes would be on the first and third 16th notes. Therefore, the H line should be XX--|XX-- etc. But let me confirm.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the tempo doubled, so the same notes but played faster. But the notation is per 16th note, so perhaps converting the existing quarter notes to eighth notes. Let me see an example from previous responses. For instance, when someone wanted more notes, they changed the H line to XxXx etc. So maybe for double time, the hi-hat goes to eighth notes, which would mean every two 16th notes. So each beat's four 16th notes would have two hits. So for each beat, instead of X---, it would be X-X- (but that's every other 16th?), no. Wait, eighth notes are two 16th notes. So in terms of the 16th note notation, each eighth note is two 16th notes. So to play eighth notes on the hi-hat, every two 16th notes would have a hit. So the pattern would be XX--|XX-- etc. But since each beat is four 16th notes, two eighth notes would be two hits per beat. So for each beat, the first and third 16th notes? Wait, no. Let me think again.

A beat has four 16th notes: 1, 2, 3, 4. An eighth note is two 16th notes, so an eighth note on beat 1 would be the first two 16th notes (1 and 2), but if it's a stream of eighth notes, it would be on 1, 3, etc. Wait, actually, if you have eighth notes in a 4/4 bar, each beat is divided into two eighth notes. So in terms of 16th notes, each eighth note is two 16th notes. So for a double time feel, the hi-hat would be playing eighth notes, so every two 16th notes. That would mean for each beat (four 16th notes), the pattern would be X-X- (X on the first and third 16th notes), but that's actually eighth notes. Wait, no. Let me think of it as:

Original quarter notes (four 16ths per beat):

Beat 1: X--- (hit on the first 16th)
Beat 2: X--- (hit on first 16th of beat 2)
etc.

Double time would mean eighth notes on the hi-hat, so every two 16th notes. So in each beat, two hits:

Beat 1: XX-- (first two 16ths)
Beat 2: XX--
But that would be eighth notes on each beat, but starting on the first 16th. Alternatively, perhaps alternating between X and something else. Wait, maybe it's better to have the hi-hat on every eighth note, so the pattern would be X-X- for each beat (X on the 1 and 3 of the 16th notes). That way, each beat has two hits. So the H line would be X-X- repeated for each beat.

So H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

But let me check previous examples. For instance, in a previous answer where the user wanted "closed hihat on all 16-th notes," the H line became Xxxx|Xxxx etc. But here, the user wants double time, which is typically eighth notes. So maybe X-X- for each beat.

Now, the kick and snare need to be adjusted as well. The original has kick on beats 1 and 3 (O---|----|O---|----). In double time, maybe the kick plays on every beat but with more subdivisions? Or perhaps the kick remains on the downbeats but with more syncopation. Alternatively, in double time, the kick might play on the first and third 16th notes of each beat to match the faster tempo. Alternatively, maybe the kick stays the same but the snare is moved or added.

Alternatively, the standard double time beat might have the kick on 1 and 3, and the snare on 2 and 4, but with the hi-hat on eighth notes. But the original is already kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. So maybe just changing the hi-hat to eighth notes. Let me see.

Wait, the original groove is a simple rock beat. Doubling the time would mean making it a faster tempo, but in terms of the notation, since the bar length is fixed, we need to fit more notes. So converting the hi-hat to eighth notes (two per beat) would achieve that. So H line becomes X-X- repeated each beat. Let me write that out:

H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

Then, the kick and snare might need to be adjusted. The kick is currently O--- on beats 1 and 3. In a double time feel, maybe the kick stays the same, but the snare could have more hits. Alternatively, the snare might play on the offbeats. Wait, the original snare is on beats 2 and 4 (O--- on the second and fourth beats). To make it double time, perhaps the snare is moved to the "&" of the beat (the eighth note between). But that might be more of a syncopation.

Alternatively, perhaps the snare remains the same but with ghost notes. But the user just said "make this double time," so the main thing is the hi-hat. Let me check previous examples where similar requests were made. For instance, when someone wanted "double kick," the K line was filled with O's. But here, it's the whole groove.

Alternatively, maybe the kick also plays on every eighth note. But that might be overkill. Let me think again. The standard double time beat often has the kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, but with the hi-hat on eighth notes. So the kick and snare stay the same, but the hi-hat moves to eighth notes. That would be the minimal change. So H line becomes X-X- per beat.

Alternatively, maybe the kick is doubled, like O-O- in each beat, but that's a guess. Let me see the original:

Original K: O--- (beat 1), ---- (beat 2), O--- (beat3), ---- (beat4). So beats 1 and 3 have kicks. In double time, perhaps the kick plays on every beat but split? Not sure. Maybe keep the kick as is, but adjust hi-hat. Let's proceed with that first.

So the new H line would be X-X- for each beat. Let me write that out:

H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

Then the other instruments stay the same. Let's check if that's enough. The user might also want the kick and snare to have more activity, but since the request is to "double time," perhaps the main change is the hi-hat to eighth notes. Let me confirm with an example from previous interactions. In a previous answer when the user wanted "double time," the assistant changed the H line from X--- to X-X- for each beat. For example, in the user's previous request where they wanted "double time," the assistant's response was:

H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

So I'll follow that approach here. Therefore, the final groove would have the H line as above, and the rest unchanged except maybe the crash or ride, but the original had none. Let me ensure the other lines remain as per the original.

So the K line remains O---|----|O---|----

S line remains ----|O---|----|O---

T, C, R are still empty.

Thus, the edited groove would be:

K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

That should be the double time version by adding the hi-hat on eighth notes.
