Sure! To give the groove a more metal feel, I'll add more aggressive hits, especially emphasizing the kick and snare, and incorporating sharper hi-hat and cymbal hits to increase intensity. Here's the edited metal-style drum groove:

This version features:
- More pronounced kick placement (on every beat) to drive the rhythm.
- Snares placed on the 2nd and 4th beats with added accents.
- Continuous aggressive hi-hat patterns with open hits, creating a driving feel.
- Occasional tom hits to add intensity.
- Cymbals (Crash, Ride) hits to emphasize transitions.
Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!
