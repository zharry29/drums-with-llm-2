Certainly! To create a half-time feel while keeping everything else, the main adjustment is to slow down the perceived tempo by doubling the duration of each note. In notation terms, this typically means extending the length of each hit to occupy two 16th notes, effectively making the groove feel more laid-back.

In practice, for the existing groove, this can be achieved by introducing rests (dashes) to fill in the space for half-time feel, and reducing the number of hits per measure accordingly. 

Here's the original groove:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

For a half-time feel, we'll make the hits last twice as long (occupying two 16th notes), and add rests where appropriate to emphasize the slower feel.

Here's the edited groove with a half-time feel:

Actually, to fully embody a half-time feel, it often involves reducing the number of hits and emphasizing the rests. Let's adjust the pattern more significantly:

- The Kick on beat 1 and 3, held for two 16th notes each.
- The Snare on beats 2 and 4, also held longer.
- The Hi-hat maintains a steady pattern, but with half-time perception, the accents shift.

Here's a more pronounced half-time pattern:

```

K: O-----|------|O-----|------
S: ------|O-----|------|O-----
H: x-----|x-----|x-----|x-----
T: ------|------|------|------
C: ------|------|------|------
R: ------|------|------|------

```

Wait, that seems more like a simplified groove, but to stay true to the original, just with a half-time feel, a good approach is:

- Keep the same pattern but extend the length of the hits or reduce their frequency.

Here's a refined version, keeping the pattern but applying a half-time feel by doubling the length of each note:

```
@@@
K: O--- --| -- --| O--- --| -- --
S: ---- --| O--- --| ---- --| O--- --
H: x--- --| x--- --| x--- --| x---
T: ---- --| ---- --| ---- --| ---- --
C: ---- --| ---- --| ---- --| ---- --
R: ---- --| ---- --| ---- --| ---- --

```

But given the notation style, perhaps the clearest way is simply doubling the spacing between hits, so the pattern is more spaced out to reflect half time.

Here's the final version in proper notation, representing a half-time feel by spacing out hits:

```

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|--O-|----|--O-
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

In summary, the main change is spacing out hits to give the feel of half-time rhythm.

Would you like me to finalize one version, or do you have specific elements you'd like to emphasize?
