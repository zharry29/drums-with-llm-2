Certainly! I'll keep the same number of tom hits but make them more dynamic by emphasizing their presence, perhaps with more open or accentuated hits to create a more lively and energetic feel. Here's the revised groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|S---|--S-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: --O-|----|--O-|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

In this version, the Toms have been enhanced with open hits ("O") at the start of the second and fourth beats, adding more dynamic emphasis to the groove. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!
