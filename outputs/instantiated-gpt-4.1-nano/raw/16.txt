Certainly! To meet the request:
- Play closed hi-hat (X) on all 8th notes (every second note in each 16th note group).
- Open hi-hat (O) on every up beat (the second and fourth beats).
- Keep the hits hard, which are represented by X for closed and O for open.

Let's analyze the original hi-hat line:
Original: `--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`

We'll modify it according to the instruction:
- On every 8th note (positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16), replace with appropriate articulation.
- Open on the up beats (start of beat 2 and beat 4): positions 8 and 16.
- Closed on all other 8th notes.

Here's the adjusted hi-hat line:
- Positions (numbering the 16 notes): 1-16
- Open (O) on 8, 16
- Closed (X) on 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14

Constructed line:
`--X-|-X-|-X-|-X-` â€” but we need to open on beats 2 and 4, so open at 8 and 16 (positions 8 and 16):
`--X-|-X-|-X-|-X-`

Wait, but per the exact position, the 16 notes are:

| Note Number | Position | Articulation |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| 1            | 1          | -            |
| 2            | 2          | X           |
| 3            | 3          | -            |
| 4            | 4          | X           |
| 5            | 5          | -            |
| 6            | 6          | X           |
| 7            | 7          | -            |
| 8            | 8          | O (open second beat up) |
| 9            | 9          | -            |
| 10           | 10         | X           |
| 11           | 11         | -            |
| 12           | 12         | X           |
| 13           | 13         | -            |
| 14           | 14         | X           |
| 15           | 15         | -            |
| 16           | 16         | O (open fourth beat up) |

Thus, the line should be:

`--X-|-X-|-X-|-X-` with the last note (16) being open, so at 16 we put O instead of X. But since that's an open hit, and the other notes are closed, the notation would be:

`--X-|-X-|-X-|-O-`

Putting it together, the full notation line:

`--X-|-X-|-X-|-O-`

Now, integrating into the full groove with the rest unchanged.

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --X-|-X-|-X-|-O-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This reflects the modifications:
- Closed hi-hat (X) on all 8th notes except the last note where it opens (O) on the second and fourth beat up notes.
- Open hits on the second and fourth beats (positions 8 and 16).
- Other instruments unchanged.
