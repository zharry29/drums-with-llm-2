Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. Let me first understand the problem.

The user provided a drum notation with each instrument's part. The current groove has K (kick), S (snare), H (hihat), T (toms), C (crash cymbal), and R (ride cymbal). The user's edit request says they don't want any kick or snare. So, I need to remove all K and S elements and adjust the other instruments accordingly.

Looking at the current K: O--O|----|--O-|----. That's the kick drum part. Since the user doesn't want kick, I'll replace this with dashes across all 16 notes. So, K: -----|----|-----|----.

Similarly, the S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o. The snare drum is present. I'll replace this entire line with dashes as well: S: -----|-----|-----|-----.

Now, I need to check if any other instruments are affected. The H, T, C, and R lines don't involve K or S, so they can stay as they are.

Wait, but in the original response, the H line was changed to X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-. Maybe that's a typo or a mistake. I should ensure that the H, T, C, and R lines remain consistent with the user's request.

So, the final edited groove should have only H, T, C, and R, with K and S completely removed. Let me reconstruct each line properly.

K: All dashes.
S: All dashes.
H: As in the original but without any changes since the user didn't mention altering the hihat.
T: As in the original.
C: As in the original.
R: As in the original.

Putting it all together, I'll make sure each instrument's line is correctly represented without kick or snare. That should fulfill the user's request accurately.
