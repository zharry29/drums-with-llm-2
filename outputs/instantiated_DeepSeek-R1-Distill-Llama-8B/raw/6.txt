Okay, so I need to help the user by editing their drum groove based on their request. The user provided a lot of information about drum notation and the current groove, and the edit request is to change all the snare hits to sidesticks. 

First, I should make sure I understand the drum notation. Each line represents a different drum or cymbal. The characters in each line represent notes, and the | separators divide them into beats. Each four characters make a beat. The characters can be '-', meaning the note isn't played, or specific letters that denote how each instrument is played.

Looking at the current groove, the snare drum (S) has O--- and O---, which are hard hits, and also some o's and X's. The user wants to change all the snare hits to sidesticks. Sidesticks for snare would be X or x, depending on whether it's a hard or soft hit.

So, I need to go through each part of the snare line and replace the O's and o's with X's and x's. The S line currently has:

----|O---|----|O---

Which means in the first beat, there's a soft hit (o) and in the third beat, a hard hit (O). I'll replace those with X's. So it becomes:

----|X---|----|X---

Similarly, the other parts of the S line that have O's or o's should be changed to X's or x's. 

Wait, the user didn't specify whether the sidesticks should be hard or soft, so I should probably stick with the existing pattern. In the original groove, the snare had X--- and --X-, so I'll keep that consistency.

So, the edited S line would be:

----|X---|----|X---

That should replace all snare hits with sidesticks, as requested. I should make sure that the other instruments remain unchanged, except for the snare. 

Let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss any other parts. The K, H, T, C, and R lines should stay the same. 

So, the final edited groove will have the S line updated, and the rest remains as is. I'll present it within the @@@ notation as instructed.
