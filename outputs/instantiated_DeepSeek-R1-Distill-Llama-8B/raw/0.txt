Okay, so I need to add some kick to the given drum groove. Let me first understand what the original groove looks like. The user provided a drum notation with each instrument's part. The goal is to enhance the kick drum's presence without messing up the other elements too much.

Looking at the Kick drum (K) line: it's currently "o---|--o-|o---|--o-". Each part is a beat, and each beat has four notes. The current K line has 'o's on the first and third beats, and the other beats are open. The user wants to add more kick, so I should make the kick drum more prominent.

I know that in drum notation, the 'O' is a hard hit, while 'o' is soft. So maybe replacing some of the 'o's with 'O's would make the kick harder. Let's see the original K line: o---, then |, then --o-, etc. So each part is four characters. Let me break it down.

First beat: o---. Maybe I can change the first 'o' to 'O' to make it a harder hit. So it becomes O---. That should add more punch.

Second beat: |--o-. The current note is 'o', which is a soft hit. Maybe I can add another 'O' here. But wait, each part is four notes, so maybe I can have two 'O's in the same beat. Let me think. The second beat currently has one 'o'. If I add another 'O' or maybe an 'X' for a harder stick. Wait, the Kick drum doesn't use 'X' notation, right? The K line uses 'O' and 'o'. So perhaps replacing the 'o' with 'O' would make it a harder hit. So the second beat becomes |--O-.

Third beat: o---. Similarly, I can change this to O--- to make it harder.

Fourth beat: |--o-. Again, change the 'o' to 'O' to add more kick.

So the new K line would be O---|---|O---|---. Wait, no, the original is o---|--o-|o---|--o-. If I change each 'o' to 'O', it becomes O---|---|O---|---. But that might be too much, making the kick too dominant. Alternatively, maybe I can have 'O's on the first and third beats, and keep the second and fourth as they are or maybe add more 'O's where possible.

Wait, let me count the notes. Each bar has 16 notes, four beats. Each beat has four notes. So the original K line has 'o' on the first note of each beat, except the second and fourth. So maybe adding an 'O' on the third note of each beat could add more punch without overdoing it.

Alternatively, perhaps replacing the 'o's with 'O's in the first and third beats, and adding an 'X' in the second and fourth beats where possible. Wait, but Kick drum doesn't use 'X's. Only Snare, Hihat, Toms, etc., use 'X's. So for K, only 'O' and 'o' are used. So maybe just replacing the 'o's with 'O's where appropriate.

So, original K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-

Let me change each 'o' to 'O':

O---|---|O---|---. Wait, but that would make the second and fourth beats have only one note. No, wait, each part is four notes. Let me write it correctly.

Each beat is four notes, separated by |. So the original is:

Beat 1: o--- (four notes)
Beat 2: --o- (four notes, but the first two are dashes, then 'o', then two dashes)
Wait, no, the original is K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-

So each part is four notes, so the structure is:

Beat 1: o--- (notes 1-4)
Beat 2: --o- (notes 5-8)
Beat 3: o--- (notes 9-12)
Beat 4: --o- (notes 13-16)

So to add more kick, I can make the 'o's into 'O's in beats 1 and 3, and maybe add an 'O' in beats 2 and 4 as well.

So Beat 1: O--- (notes 1-4)
Beat 2: --O- (notes 5-8)
Beat 3: O--- (notes 9-12)
Beat 4: --O- (notes 13-16)

That way, every beat has an 'O' in the third note, which might give a stronger kick.

So the new K line would be O---|---|O---|---.

Wait, but in the original, the second beat is |--o-, which is notes 5-8: -, -, o, -. Changing the 'o' to 'O' gives --O-. Similarly, the fourth beat is |--o-, so changing to --O-.

So the new K line would be O---|---|O---|---.

Alternatively, maybe adding 'O's in all four beats, but that might be too much. Let me see.

Original K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-

New K: O---|---|O---|---. Wait, that's not correct because the second and fourth beats would have only one 'O' each. Let me make sure each beat has four notes.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

Beat 1: O--- (notes 1-4)
Beat 2: --O- (notes 5-8)
Beat 3: O--- (notes 9-12)
Beat 4: --O- (notes 13-16)

So the new K line is O---|---|O---|---.

Wait, but that would make the second and fourth beats have only one 'O' each. Maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe I can have two 'O's in each beat, but that might be too much.

Alternatively, perhaps replacing the 'o's with 'O's in all beats where possible. So:

Beat 1: O--- (notes 1-4)
Beat 2: --O- (notes 5-8)
Beat 3: O--- (notes 9-12)
Beat 4: --O- (notes 13-16)

So the K line becomes O---|---|O---|---.

I think that's a good approach. It adds 'O's in the first and third beats, and also in the second and fourth beats, making the kick more prominent without overdoing it.

Now, let me check if this affects the other instruments. The user wants to add some kick, so only the K line needs to be adjusted. The other lines (S, H, T, C, R) should remain the same.

So the final drum groove would have the K line updated as above, and the rest as per the original.

Let me write it out properly:

@@@
K: O---|---|O---|---
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

Wait, but the original R line is x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-. I should keep that as is.

Yes, that should do it. The K line now has more 'O's, adding more kick without disrupting the other parts.
