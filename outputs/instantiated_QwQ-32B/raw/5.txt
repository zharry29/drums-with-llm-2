Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to avoid having the snare on the downbeat of beats 2 and 4. First, I need to understand the original groove structure.

Looking at the given groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
S: ----|X---|--X-|----  
H: ----|x---|----|x---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-  

The snare (S line) has hits on the second beat (X---) and the fourth beat (--X-). The user wants to remove the snare from the downbeats of beats 2 and 4. 

First, let's identify where the downbeats are. Each beat is four 16th notes. The downbeat of each beat is the first 16th note. So for beat 2, the downbeat is the first 16th note of the second beat (position 5 in the first bar), and for beat 4, it's the first 16th note of the fourth beat (position 13 in the bar).

In the original S line:
- Beat 2 (second segment after the first |): X---. The X is on the downbeat of beat 2.
- Beat 4 (fourth segment): --X- has an X on the third 16th note of the fourth beat, which is the "and" of the beat, not the downbeat. Wait, let me check again. The fourth segment is the fourth beat. The fourth segment is "--X-", so the X is on the third 16th note of that beat, which is the "and" of the beat (like the '&' between 4 and 1). Hmm, so actually, the X is not on the downbeat of beat 4. The downbeat would be the first character of that segment. The current S line for the fourth beat is "--X-", so the first character is '-', so no hit on the downbeat of beat 4. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the user's request. The user said "downbeat of 2 and 4", so perhaps the snare on beat 2's downbeat is the issue, and beat 4's snare is not on the downbeat. But maybe the user is referring to beat 4's downbeat as well, even if the current S line doesn't have it? Let me confirm.

Original S line breakdown:

Segments separated by |:

1. ---- (beat 1: no snare)
2. X--- (beat 2: X on first 16th note, so downbeat)
3. --X- (beat 3: X on third 16th note)
4. ---- (beat 4: no snare here?)

Wait, the fourth segment is "--X-", which is the fourth beat. Wait, no, let me parse the S line again:

The S line is written as: "----|X---|--X-|----"

Breaking it down:

First segment (beat 1): "----" → no snare.

Second segment (beat 2): "X---" → X on the first 16th note (downbeat of beat 2).

Third segment (beat 3): "--X-" → X on the third 16th note (the "and" of beat 3).

Fourth segment (beat 4): "----" → no snare here. Wait, but in the user's provided groove, the fourth segment of S is "--X-", not "----". Wait, looking back:

Wait, the user's input is:

S: ----|X---|--X-|----

Ah, the fourth segment is "----", so no snare on beat 4. So the user's request is to avoid snare on downbeats 2 and 4, but in the original, the snare on beat 4 is not present. The only snare on a downbeat is beat 2's first 16th note (the X in the second segment). So the user wants to remove that X, and perhaps also ensure that beat 4's downbeat has no snare (which it already doesn't). 

So the main issue is the snare on beat 2's downbeat. The user wants to avoid that. 

Possible approach: Move the snare hit from the downbeat of beat 2 to another part of that beat. For example, instead of X on the first 16th note, maybe the second or third. Alternatively, replace it with a different articulation or move it to a different beat.

Looking at the original second segment (beat 2 for S is "X---"). To remove the downbeat hit, we can replace the X with '-', so it becomes "----", but then there would be no snare on beat 2. However, the user might want some snare presence on beat 2 but not on the downbeat. Alternatively, shift the hit to the second 16th note (the "and" of the beat). For example, changing to "-X--" or "-X--" so that the hit is on the "and".

Alternatively, if the user wants to keep the snare on beat 2 but not on the downbeat, then moving it to the second 16th note (the '&' of beat 2) would satisfy that. 

Similarly, for beat 4, since there's no snare there, maybe the user wants to add a snare but not on the downbeat, but the current request is just to avoid having it on 2 and 4's downbeats. Since beat 4's snare is not present, maybe the user is just concerned about beat 2.

So, modifying the second segment (beat 2) of the snare line from "X---" to something like "-X--", shifting the hit to the second 16th note. That way, it's on the "and" of beat 2, not the downbeat. 

Let me check the rest of the groove to ensure it fits. The original S line's third segment is "--X-", which is on the third 16th of beat 3. So moving beat 2's snare to the second 16th would create a more syncopated feel. 

So the edited S line would be:

S: ----| -X-- | --X- |----

Wait, let's reconstruct the entire S line:

Original: S: ----|X---|--X-|----

After change: 

First segment: ---- (beat1)

Second segment: -X-- (beat2: hit on second 16th)

Third segment: --X- (beat3: same as before)

Fourth segment: ---- (beat4: same as before)

Thus, the new S line would be "----|-X--|--X-|----".

Additionally, check if there are any other snare hits on downbeats of 2 or 4. Since the fourth segment is still "----", there's no snare there, so that's okay.

Another consideration: The user might also want to check if any other parts of the groove have snares on those downbeats, but according to the original, only beat2 has the downbeat hit. 

So the final edited groove would have the snare moved in beat2 to the second 16th note. 

Double-checking the notation rules for S: X is a hard sidestick hit, which is allowed here. Since the original used X in the second segment, changing the position but keeping X is fine.

Therefore, the edited S line should be:

S: ----|-X--|--X-|----
