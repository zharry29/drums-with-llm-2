Okay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They provided a drum groove and want to make sure there's no ride cymbal on the fourth beat. The original groove doesn't have any ride in the first place, so maybe they want to confirm or perhaps there was a previous version with ride on beat 4. Let me check the given groove again.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The Ride (R) line is all dashes, meaning no ride is played anywhere. The user might have thought there was a ride on beat 4, but according to the provided groove, there isn't. However, to comply with their request strictly, even if it's already the case, I should ensure that beat 4 of the ride remains silent. Since all the other parts are fine, I just need to make sure that the Ride line stays as it is. There's no change needed here. The user might have intended to remove something that wasn't there, so the final groove remains unchanged except confirming that ride is absent on beat 4. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo, but based on the given data, the answer should reflect the same as the input.
