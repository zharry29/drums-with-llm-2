Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants all the snare hits changed to sidesticks. First, I need to recall the notation rules for the snare (S). According to the provided info, the snare uses O for a hard hit, o for a soft open hit, and X/x for hard and soft sidestick hits.

Looking at the original groove's S line:
S: ----|O---|----|O---

The snare hits are on the second and fourth beats, both denoted by O. Since the request is to switch these to sidesticks, I need to replace those O's with X's. The sidestick options are X (hard) and x (soft). The original uses O (hard hits), so replacing them with X makes sense to keep the same intensity. 

So, changing the O's to X's in the S line. Let me check the positions. The second beat (after the first |) has an O on the first 16th note of that beat. Wait, actually, each beat is four characters. Let me parse the line again:

S: ---- | O--- | ---- | O---

Breaking it down:
- First beat: "----" (no hits)
- Second beat: "O---" (hit on the first 16th note of the second beat, which is the fifth 16th note overall)
- Third beat: "----"
- Fourth beat: "O---" (hit on the first 16th note of the fourth beat, which is the 13th note overall)

So replacing those O's with X's. The modified S line should be:
S: ----|X---|----|X---

Now, I need to ensure that no other snare hits are present. The rest of the S line is dashes, so that's good. The other instruments (K, H, T, C, R) remain unchanged unless the edit affects them, but the request is only about the snare. 

Wait, the H line (hihat) has X's, but that's okay because hihat's X/x are closed hits, which is different from snare's sidestick. No conflict there. 

Let me double-check the notation rules again to confirm. Snare's sidestick is X (hard) and x (soft). Since the original was O (hard), replacing with X is correct. 

So the final edited groove should have the S line as above. Let me write out the entire edited groove to make sure everything else stays the same.
