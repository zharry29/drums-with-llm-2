Okay, so the user wants a more funky beat. Let me think about what makes a drum groove "funky." Funky beats often have syncopation, ghost notes, and a loose, groove-oriented feel. The original groove here is pretty straight: kick on beats 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, and closed hi-hat on every quarter note. That's a basic rock beat.

To make it funkier, I should add some syncopation. Maybe add some off-beat hits. Ghost notes on the snare could help. Also, the hi-hat pattern can be more active. Let me check the instruments again.

The kick (K) is on the downbeats. Maybe keep that but add some syncopation. The snare (S) is on 2 and 4. To funk it up, maybe add some ghost notes (soft hits) around those. The hi-hat (H) is closed on each beat. Maybe open it on the "&" (the "and" of the beat) to create a more swung feel. Also, using a mix of closed and open hi-hat could add texture.

Looking at the notation rules, for the snare, "o" is a soft open hit. So ghost notes could be "o" on the off-beats. Let's see:

Original snare line: "----|O---|----|O---" (so snare on the second 16th note of beats 2 and 4). To add ghost notes, maybe place soft hits on the "e" and "ah" of the beats. For example, in the first beat, maybe "-o--", then on beat 2, "O-o-" to have a ghost note after the snare. Similarly for the others.

For the hi-hat, instead of all X (closed hard), maybe alternate between closed and open. Like X on the downbeat and O on the "and". So something like "X-O-X-O..." but need to fit the 16th notes. Let me structure each beat as four 16th notes. For example, each beat could be X-O-X-O, but that's four notes. Wait, each beat is four 16th notes. So for each beat, maybe X on the first, then O on the second, X on third, O on fourth? That would be "X-O-X-O" but in four characters. Wait, each beat is four 16th notes separated by |. So each beat is four characters. Let's see:

Original H is X---|X---|X---|X---, meaning closed on the first 16th of each beat. To make it funkier, maybe alternate between closed and open on each 16th. Like X-O-X-O for each beat. So each beat would be "X-OX" but spread over four notes. Wait, four characters per beat. Let me think:

First beat: positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (16th notes). To have a swung feel, maybe closed on 1, open on 2, closed on 3, open on 4. That would be "X-OX" but that's four characters. Wait, "X" (beat 1), "O" (beat &), "X" (beat 3), "O" (beat &). So each beat would be "X-OX" but the notation is four characters per beat. So each beat would be "X-OX" but using the correct characters. So for each beat in H, "X-OX".

Putting it all together:

Snare (S): Let's add ghost notes. Original has O on the second 16th of beats 2 and 4. Let's add o (soft) on the first 16th of each beat. So first beat: "-o--", second beat: "O-o-", third beat: "-o--", fourth beat: "O-o-". That would give a ghost note before each snare hit. So S line becomes: "-o--|O-o-|-o--|O-o-".

Hi-hat (H): Each beat as "X-OX". So first beat: X-OX, second same, etc. So H line would be "X-OX|X-OX|X-OX|X-OX".

Kick (K) stays the same unless we want to add syncopation. Maybe keep it as is for simplicity, but sometimes funk uses more syncopated kick. Alternatively, maybe add a syncopated kick on the "and" of 2 and 4? Let me check original K: "O---|----|O---|----". So kick on 1 of first beat, 1 of third beat. Maybe add a kick on the "&" of 2 and 4? Let's see. For example, in the second beat (which is all ----), maybe add an o on the third 16th note? Not sure. Alternatively, keep kick as is for now, since the user might want to focus on snare and hi-hat for funkiness.

Putting it all together, the new groove would be:

K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: -o--|O-o-|-o--|O-o-  
H: X-OX|X-OX|X-OX|X-OX  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, but let's check the notation rules. For the Hihat, O is open hit. So the first character of each beat is X (closed hard), then O (open hard?), but need to confirm. Wait, H's notation says O is hard open, o is soft open. X and x are closed hits (hard and soft). So for the Hihat line, each beat would be X (closed hard on 1), O (open hard on 2), X (closed hard on 3), O (open hard on 4). That should give a swung feel with the open and closed hits alternating, which is common in funk.

The snare line now has ghost notes on the first 16th of each beat (soft hits) and the main snare on 2 and 4. That should add the ghost notes typical in funk.

I think this should make it sound more funky. Let me double-check the user's request: "more funky" so syncopation, ghost notes, and a more active hi-hat. This should fit. Let me make sure the characters are correctly placed. Each beat has four characters, so yes. The S line's ghost notes are soft (o) which is correct. The H line alternates between closed and open on each 16th note. That should do it.
