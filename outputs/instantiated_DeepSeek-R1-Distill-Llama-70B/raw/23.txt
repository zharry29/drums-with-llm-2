Alright, so the user wants me to double the tempo of the given drum groove. Let me first understand what that means. Doubling the time means that the same rhythm will be played at twice the speed, effectively making each beat happen twice as fast. 

Looking at the original groove, it's a pretty straightforward rock pattern. The kick drum is on beats 1 and 3, the snare on beats 2 and 4, and the hihat is playing steady 16th notes. To make it double time, I need to adjust the note values so that each beat is subdivided into smaller intervals.

I'll start by analyzing each instrument line. For the kick drum, it's currently on the first note of each beat. To double it, I'll add another kick hit on the eighth note of each beat, making it "O-O--" in each beat. This way, it's playing on every eighth note, effectively doubling the speed.

Next, the snare drum is on beats 2 and 4. To double time, I'll add snare hits on the "e" of each beat, so it becomes "o-O--" in each beat. This adds a snare hit on the eighth note after each beat, making it more driving.

The hihat is already playing steady 16th notes with "X---|X---|X---|X---". To double time, I'll change it to "X-X-X-X-" in each beat, which means it's playing on every 16th note, creating a busier, faster feel.

I'll keep the Toms, Crash, and Ride cymbals the same since they don't have any notes in the original groove. 

Putting it all together, the kick and snare will have additional hits on the eighth notes, and the hihat will play on every 16th note, creating a double-time effect. This should make the groove feel more intense and faster, fitting the user's request.
