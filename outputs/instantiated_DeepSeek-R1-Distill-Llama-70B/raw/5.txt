Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove based on their request. Let me first understand the problem. They have a specific drum groove and want to modify it so that the snare drum doesn't play on the downbeats of beats 2 and 4. 

First, I'll look at the current drum groove they provided. The snare line is: S: ----|X---|--X-|----. So, on beat 2 and beat 4, there's an X, which is a hard sidestick hit. The user wants to avoid having the snare on these downbeats. 

I need to remove or change these X's. But I don't want the groove to feel empty, so I should consider adding something on off-beats or other parts to compensate. Maybe adding a soft open hit (o) or a soft sidestick (x) on nearby notes could work. 

Looking at the hihat line: H: ----|x---|----|x---. It's playing on the off-beats, which is good. If I add more hihat hits, it can fill in the spaces where the snare was. 

I'll go through each beat:

1. Beat 1: Snare is not on the downbeat, so no change needed.
2. Beat 2: Remove the X on the downbeat. Maybe add a soft open hit (o) on the 8th note before the next beat to keep the rhythm interesting.
3. Beat 3: Snare is not on the downbeat, so no change.
4. Beat 4: Remove the X on the downbeat. Similarly, add a soft open hit (o) on the 8th note before the next beat.

Now, I'll adjust the hihat to add some hits on the 8th notes where I added the snare hits. This way, the rhythm stays dynamic without the snare on beats 2 and 4.

Let me put it all together:

- Snare: Remove X's on beats 2 and 4, add o's on the 8th notes before beats 3 and 5.
- Hihat: Add o's on those same 8th notes to complement the snare.

I think this should fulfill the user's request while keeping the groove engaging.
