Alright, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to have no more than 8 notes in the entire groove. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, I'll look at the current drum groove they provided:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

I need to count the number of notes (any character that's not a '-') in each line and make sure the total doesn't exceed 8.

Starting with the Kick drum (K):
- First beat: O--O → 2 notes
- Second beat: ---- → 0 notes
- Third beat: --O- → 1 note
- Fourth beat: ---- → 0 notes
Total for K: 3 notes

Snare drum (S):
- First beat: ---- → 0 notes
- Second beat: Oo-o → 3 notes
- Third beat: -o-- → 1 note
- Fourth beat: O--o → 2 notes
Total for S: 6 notes

Hihat (H):
- Each beat: X-x- → 2 notes per beat
- Four beats → 8 notes
Total for H: 8 notes

Toms (T): All ---- → 0 notes
Crash cymbal (C): All ---- → 0 notes
Ride cymbal (R): All ---- → 0 notes

Adding them up: K=3, S=6, H=8, T=0, C=0, R=0 → Total=17 notes

Okay, so we have 17 notes, but we need to reduce it to 8. That's a significant reduction. I need to figure out where to cut back.

First, the Hihat has 8 notes alone. If I reduce that, it would help a lot. Maybe make the Hihat simpler, like having it closed (x) on off-beats instead of the alternating X and x. That would reduce the number of notes.

Looking at the Snare, it's got 6 notes. Maybe I can simplify that too, perhaps using fewer sidesticks or open hits.

For the Kick, it's already at 3 notes, which is manageable, but I might need to reduce it further if necessary.

Let me try revising each line:

1. **Kick Drum (K):** Keep the essential beats but maybe soften some hits to 'o' to reduce the number of hard hits, but that doesn't reduce the note count. Maybe remove one note.

2. **Snare Drum (S):** Replace some of the open hits with sidesticks or reduce the number of hits.

3. **Hihat (H):** Simplify the pattern to have fewer notes, maybe just closed hits (x) on certain beats.

4. **Toms (T), Crash (C), Ride (R):** Keep them as is since they're already minimal.

Let me try adjusting each line:

- **K:** Maybe change to "o--o|----|--o-" → 3 notes
- **S:** Simplify to "----|X---|----|X---" → 2 notes
- **H:** Change to "x---|x---|x---|x---" → 4 notes
- **T, C, R:** Keep at 0 notes

Total notes: K=3, S=2, H=4 → Total=9 notes. Still over 8.

Need to reduce further. Maybe remove one more note from Hihat, making it "x--x|x--x|x--x|x--x" → 4 notes.

Alternatively, remove a note from Snare. Maybe "----|X---|----|----" → 1 note.

Now total: K=3, S=1, H=4 → Total=8 notes. Perfect.

So, the final groove would be:

```
K: o--o|----|--o-|----  
S: ----|X---|----|----  
H: x---|x---|x---|x---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This way, the total number of notes is exactly 8, meeting the user's requirement.
