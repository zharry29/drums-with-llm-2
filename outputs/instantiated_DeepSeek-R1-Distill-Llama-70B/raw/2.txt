Alright, so I've been given this drum groove, and the user wants me to edit it so that there are no kick or snare hits. Let me first look at the original groove to understand what's going on.

Here's the original groove:

@@@
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Okay, so the Kick (K) line has some hits: O--O|----|--O-|----. That means on the first beat, there's a hard hit on the first 16th note, then nothing for the next three, then another hard hit on the fifth 16th note, and so on.

The Snare (S) line is more complicated: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o. So, in the second beat, there's a hard snare hit, followed by a soft open hit, then a soft sidestick, and then nothing for the next three. This pattern continues.

The Hihat (H) is pretty busy: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-. So, it's alternating between hard and soft closed hits every 16th note. That's a pretty driving rhythm.

The Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R) are all empty, so they're not being used in this groove.

Now, the user wants me to remove all the kick and snare hits. That means I need to set all the K and S lines to be all dashes, representing no hits.

But wait, if I remove both the kick and the snare, the groove might feel empty or lacking in rhythm. The kick and snare are the backbone of most drum grooves, providing the basic pulse. Without them, the hihat will be the only thing keeping the time, which might be a bit minimalistic.

However, the user specifically asked for no kick or snare, so I need to respect that. Maybe the user wants a more stripped-down or ambient feel, focusing just on the hihat.

So, I'll proceed by setting both the K and S lines to all dashes. The H line will remain as is, with its X-x- pattern. The T, C, and R lines are already empty, so I'll leave them as they are.

Let me write out the modified groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This way, only the hihat is playing, maintaining the rhythmic interest without the kick and snare. It's quite minimal, but it follows the user's instructions precisely.

I wonder if the user might want to add some toms or cymbals to fill out the sound a bit more, but since they didn't mention that, I'll stick to removing just the kick and snare.

Also, I need to make sure that the formatting is correct, with each line having 16 characters (excluding the |), and that the | are correctly placed every four characters to separate the beats.

Double-checking the hihat line: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-. Yep, that's 16 characters, with the pattern repeating every four beats. It should be consistent across all four beats.

Alright, I think this should do it. The groove now has no kick or snare, only the hihat providing the rhythm.
