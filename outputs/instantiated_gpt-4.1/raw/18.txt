Certainly! Here’s my thought process:

**Thought process:**  
Ghost notes on the snare are quiet, soft hits, usually placed on the “e” or “a” subdivisions (i.e., off the main counts: 1e+a 2e+a 3e+a 4e+a). In your groove, soft snare hits are already denoted with "o," but they look more like regular notes (“o”) rather than ghost notes, which would typically use "s" (soft sidestick) or very light "o"s for ghost notes.

I will add some ghost notes ("s") on 16th note off-beats (such as the “a” or “e” of beats), making sure they’re not clashing with main kicks or accents.

**Here is your groove with added snare ghost notes (s):**
