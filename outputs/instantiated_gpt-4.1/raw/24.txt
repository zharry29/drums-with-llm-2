To create a half-time feel, you typically:

- Shift the snare hits that are on beats 2 and 4, so that there's only a main snare on beat 3.  
- Keep the kick placement mostly the same or sometimes add a bit more space.
- Hihats and other elements usually stay the same.

The original groove is:
```
K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Let’s break it down:
- Kicks are on 1 and 3.
- Snares are on 2 and 4.
- Hihats on every downbeat (quarter notes).

**How to make it half-time:**
- Move snare hits from 2 and 4 to just beat 3 (i.e., only one snare hit per bar on “3”, which is the 9th 16th-note).

So, new pattern:
- Snare: hit only on beat 3: (count: 1  e  &  a  2  e  &  a  3  e  &  a  4  e  &  a), the 9th character.
- Kicks: keep as is (often done in half-time for simplicity).
- Hihats: keep as is.
- Other lines stay as empty as before.
