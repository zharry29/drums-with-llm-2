The last 8-th note means the 14th character in each line (counting from 1). Looking at the Hihat (H:) line from the given groove:

H: ----|x---|----|x---

The last measure is "|x---|" which corresponds to "x---" for the last 4 16th notes of the bar. The 14th note is the 2nd character in the last measure, which is currently "x" (soft closed hihat).

The request is to add an open hihat on the 14th note, which is an "o" or "O" (soft or hard open hihat). Since it's not specified if it should be soft or hard, I'll choose a hard open hihat "O" to make it distinct.

So we'll replace the "x" at the 14th note with "O".

The final Hihat line will be:

H: ----|x---|----|O---

Other lines remain unchanged.

The final groove:
