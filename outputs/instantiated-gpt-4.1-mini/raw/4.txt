The original groove's last 8th note corresponds to the 9th 16th note (since 1 beat = 4 sixteenth notes, 8th note is every 2 sixteenth notes). The last 8th note of the bar is at position 9 (counting from 1). The Hihat line currently has:
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

Looking specifically at the last beat (last four 16th notes, positions 13-16):
O-o-

Positions:
13: O (hard open)
14: - (silent)
15: o (soft open)
16: - (silent)

Counting the full 16 notes in the bar:
Positions 1-4: --o- (1: -, 2: -, 3: o, 4: -)
Positions 5-8: O-o- (5: O, 6: -, 7: o, 8: -)
Positions 9-12: O-o- (9: O, 10: -, 11: o, 12: -)
Positions 13-16: O-o- (13: O, 14: -, 15: o, 16: -)

The last 8th note corresponds to the note at position 9 and 10 (the 2 sixteenth notes for the 8th note). The "last 8th note" might mean the last half beat, which is notes 15 and 16. Since the user says "an open hihat on the last 8th note," it is likely they mean to have an open hihat hit on the last 8th note of the bar, which are the two sixteenth notes 15 and 16.

Currently, at 15: o (soft open) and 16: - (silence), so I will adjust the 16th note at position 16 to be o to represent an open hihat.

But both 15 and 16 are open already (15: soft open "o", 16: silent). So adding an open hihat on the 16th note means changing 16th note from - to "o".

So change last hihat line from "O-o-" to "O-oo" to add an open hihat on the last 8th note (position 16).

The final groove would be:
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-oo
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I will produce this as final.
