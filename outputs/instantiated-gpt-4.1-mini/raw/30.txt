Let's analyze the request and the notation:

- The second beat is the 5th to 8th 16-th notes in the bar (since the bar has 16 16-th notes dividing 4 beats).
- The 16-th notes in a beat are counted as: 1 e & a
- The cymbals are Crash cymbal (C) and Ride cymbal (R).
- There's no mention of which cymbal to use. The default cymbal for hits in the groove is the Ride cymbal (R). To keep consistency, I'll use the Ride cymbal.
- The 'a' of the '1 e & a' of the second beat is the 8th 16-th note of the bar.

Currently, the Ride line on the second beat is "X-x-". That corresponds to notes 5 to 8:
5: X (hard closed hihat),
6: -
7: x (soft closed hihat),
8: -

So the 8th note is currently '-'.

The request is for a cymbal hit, which means we should put either 'O' (hard open hit) or 'o' (soft open hit) at the 8th note of the Ride cymbal line.

Given the rhythm, the other hits are 'X' and 'x' which are closed hits; opening the cymbal 'O' at the 'a' will add an open cymbal hit as requested.

I will replace the 8th note '-' with 'O'.

The new groove will be:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|S---|--S-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-xO|x---|X-x-

Let's output the new groove.
