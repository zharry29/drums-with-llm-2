Let's analyze the request carefully:

- The second beat corresponds to the second group of 4 characters between | symbols.
- The second beat is "----" in the initial groove.
- The 'a' of the '1 e & a' is the 4th sixteenth note in the beat.
- So, in the second group of four characters, position 4 is the 'a'.

The request says to add a cymbal hit on the 'a' of the second beat. The cymbals can be crash (C) or ride (R). Since the initial groove has no cymbal hits at all and the request says "a cymbal hit" without specifying which, I will add a hard hit on the ride cymbal (R) on that position for better visibility.

Original second beat for R: "----"
- At position 4, currently '-'
- We replace with 'O' for a hard open hit on the bell

Now write it back:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|---O|----|----

This will fulfill the request.
