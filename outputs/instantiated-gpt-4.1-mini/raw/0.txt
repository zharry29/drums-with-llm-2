The original groove already has a snare pattern in some places, but it is quite soft and intermittent. To add more presence and create a stronger backbeat feel, I will add some hard snare hits on the typical 2nd and 4th beats of the bar, which is common in many drum grooves.

The snare line originally is:  
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o

I will add hard snares (S) on the 2nd 16-th note of beat 2 and on the 2nd 16-th note of beat 4 in the first bar, and also reinforce the 2nd and 4th beats with solid hits in the next bars.

Let's see how this looks:

- First bar: add S on 6th position (beat 2, 2nd 16-th note) and on 14th position (beat 4, 2nd 16-th note)
- Second bar: add S on 6th and 14th notes, replacing some softer notes or filling the gaps
- Third bar and fourth bar similarly enriched for snare

Final snare pattern could be:  
S: ----|So-o|-S--|S--S

Let's put the whole groove together accordingly.
