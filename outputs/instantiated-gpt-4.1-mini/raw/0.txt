The original groove has soft kicks (o) on the 1st and 3rd beats but only sparsely on the 2nd and 4th beats.

To add more kick to the groove, I will add some hard kicks (O) on the off-beats and a couple more soft kicks on gaps to give it a fuller, more driving feel without overwhelming other parts.

Now, applying this:

- On the first bar, add a hard kick on the 3rd 16th note.
- On the second bar, keep the current soft kick and add one on the 7th 16th note.
- On the third bar, add a hard kick on the 6th note.
- On the fourth bar, add a soft kick on the 14th note.

Resulting groove:
