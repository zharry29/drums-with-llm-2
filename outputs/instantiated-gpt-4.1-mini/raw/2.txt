The edit request asks to remove any ride or kick from the drum groove. 

Looking at the given groove:  
- Kick drum (K) has hits on many 16th notes, I will replace all these with '-' as "no kick."
- Ride cymbal (R) is already empty (all '-'), so no changes needed there.

All other lines (S, H, T, C) remain unchanged.

The updated groove without kick or ride will be:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
