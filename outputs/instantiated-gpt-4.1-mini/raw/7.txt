"Feathering" the kick drum typically means making it lighter and playing it more subtly or adding some softer hits around the main beats to create a smoother, less aggressive feel while keeping the groove intact.

In the original groove, the kick drum plays hard hits (O) on the 1st 16th note of beats 1 and 3.

To feather, I will introduce softer, smaller hits (o) on some subdivisions around these main kicks, while keeping the main hard kicks to retain the groove's structure.

I will add some soft (o) kicks mostly around the off-beats or between the main beats, for example at the 3rd 16th note after first hit and just before the 3rd beat to keep it smooth.

Here is the revised groove with feathered kick drum:
