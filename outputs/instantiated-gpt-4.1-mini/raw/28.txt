The original pattern is a very sparse groove centered mostly on the ride cymbal and some soft closed hihat on the second and fourth beats.

The request is to "comp with the bass guitar on each quarter note downbeat in a jazzy way."

In jazz, the drummer often plays more complementary kick drum and snare hits around the quarter note downbeats in a light, syncopated manner, while keeping a steady ride cymbal pattern. The kick would often "walk" with the bass at quarters, while the snare lightly accentuates or adds ghost notes and comping hits.

Here is my approach:
- Add kick drums on each quarter note (positions: 1, 5, 9, 13) to align with bass guitar hits on the downbeats.
- Highlight the snare on the 2 and 4 beats with lighter hits, e.g. soft ghost notes (s), and add a hard hit (S) for some comp.
- Retain the ride cymbal pattern as is for steady swing.
- Keep the hihat mostly as is or slightly soften for jazz feel (keep soft x on 2 and 4).
- Keep toms and crash quiet because we're focusing on comping with bass.

Here's the result:
