Let's analyze the original groove focusing on the snare hits on beats 2 and 4.

Original Snare line:  
S: ----|S---|--S-|----

The "|" divides the bar in 4 beats:  
Beat 1: ----  
Beat 2: S---  -> Snare on the downbeat of 2 (1st 16th note of beat 2)  
Beat 3: --S-  
Beat 4: ----

Beat 2 has a snare hit right on its downbeat, which is what we want to avoid. Beat 4 has no snare on its downbeat, but there is a snare hit on beat 3, third 16th note.

The edit request is "Let's avoid having the Snare on the downbeat of 2 and 4." The current groove already avoids snare on downbeat 4. Still, let's double-check the hits on beat 4:

Beat 4 fragment: ----, so no snare on 4 downbeat already.

So the only issue is the snare on the downbeat of beat 2.

Possible ways to fix snare on beat 2 downbeat:  
- Remove it  
- Move it slightly off the downbeat (e.g., to the second 16th note)

Let's try moving it off the downbeat to keep some energy and groove.

Original groove:  
S: ----|S---|--S-|----

Change to:  
S: ----|-S--|--S-|----

This moves the snare from the first 16th note of beat 2 to the second 16th note.

The rest of the groove stays unchanged.
