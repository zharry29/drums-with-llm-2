Let's analyze the request carefully:

- We need to add closed hi-hat hits on all 16th notes.
- The hi-hat should have accents on the quarter note downbeats, i.e., the 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th 16th notes in the bar.
- Closed hi-hat uses 'x' for soft closed hits and 'X' for hard closed hits (accents).
- So, on 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th 16th notes, put 'X', and on the others, put 'x'.

The original hihat line is:
H: ----|----|----|----

Now, populate it accordingly:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 | 9 10 11 12 | 13 14 15 16

Replace with:
X x x x | X x x x | X x x x | X x x x

Thus the final hihat line:
H: Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx

The rest of the instruments remain unchanged.

Final groove:
