The current groove has the ride cymbal playing a rhythm, and soft closed hihats (x) only on the second and fourth quarter note downbeats within the bar. The closed hihat notation uses X (hard/ accented closed hit) and x (soft/ unaccented closed hit). The quarter note downbeats are the first 16th note in every beat; these fall at positions: 0, 4, 8, 12 (considering the 16 16th notes indexed from 0).

The request is:
- Play closed hihat on all 16-th notes (fill every character with either x or X).
- Accent the quarter note downbeats (positions 0, 4, 8, 12) with hard closed hihats (X).
- The other positions should have soft closed hihats (x).

I will update the H line accordingly. The rest remain unchanged.

Current H: ----|x---|----|x---
Positions: 0-3 | 4-7 | 8-11 | 12-15
Should become (Hihat):
Positions 0,4,8,12 -> X (accent)
All others -> x (soft)

This yields:
H: Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx

Now, final groove with only H updated:
