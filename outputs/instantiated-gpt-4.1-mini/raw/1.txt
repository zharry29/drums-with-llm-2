The original groove has the kick drum on the 1st and 3rd beats and snare on the 2nd and 4th beats. The snare here is only on the 2nd and 4th beats (the beats common in most drum grooves), but maybe the edit request asks for a bit more presence of the snare within the beat.

I will add some soft snare hits to complement the hard snare hits, making the groove richer while keeping the original pattern. I might add some soft snare hits on the off-beats (the "and"s, i.e., the 8th notes between the main beats).

Original:
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---

New idea:
I will keep the kick pattern as is, keep the hard snare hits on 2 and 4, add soft snare hits on the off-beats after the first and third beats, giving some groove.
So add 'o' on the snare line in the 1e-6th 16th note just after first and third beats.

Let's write the new groove accordingly.

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: --o-|O---|--o-|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This is how it looks:

Bar 1 (K S H T C R):
Kick hits on 1st 16th note of beats 1 and 3.
Snare soft hit on 2nd 16th note of beat 1, and hard snare on beat 2.
Same for beat 3 with soft snare on 2nd 16th note and hard snare on beat 4.
Hihat stays steady on downbeat, closed hard hits.

This should satisfy the request of having snare along with kick, enriching the groove.
