A half-time feel means the snare drum, which usually hits on the 2nd and 4th beats in 4/4 time, will now hit only on the 3rd beat, effectively slowing down the backbeat by half. The kick drum and hihat pattern mostly stay the same in timing but might be spaced out more by feel.

Original groove:
- Kick on beats 1 and 3
- Snare on beats 2 and 4
- Hihat closed hits consistently on beat 1 of each beat

In half time feel:
- Snare hits will move from beats 2 and 4 to beat 3 only.
- Kick will stay on beat 1 and possibly add or hold on beat 3.
- Hihat to maintain the same consistent pulse.

Let's make this adjustment:

- Kick: Since everything else stays "the same," keep kicks at 1 and 3 as in original.
- Snare: Remove snare from beat 2 and 4, add snare only on beat 3.
- Hihat: stay on every 1st 16th of each beat.

Let's write the new groove.

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This matches a half-time feel by making the snare appear only on beat 3 instead of beats 2 and 4.

Now put it between @@@.
