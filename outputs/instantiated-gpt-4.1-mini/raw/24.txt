A half-time feel means that the snare hits are placed at half the speed of a normal backbeat groove. Typically, instead of hitting the snare on beats 2 and 4, in half-time feel it hits on beat 3 only. Other instruments such as kick and hi-hat often stay at the same rhythmic subdivision, keeping the same groove but the feel becomes laid-back and slower.

Looking at the original groove:
- Kick hits on 1 and 3
- Snare hits on 2 and 4
- Hi-hat hits steady quarter notes on all four beats (X---|X---|X---|X---)

For half-time feel:
- Keep Kick at 1 and 3 as normal.
- Move snare hits only to beat 3, remove snare hits on 2 and 4.
- Keep hi-hat steady on quarter notes (x---|x---|x---|x---).
- Keep Toms, Crash, Ride silent as in original.

Let's rewrite this groove accordingly:
