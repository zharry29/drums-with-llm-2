Let's first count the total number of notes in the given groove.

Original groove notes count per instrument:

- K (Kick drum): 
  - Bar 1: -O-- → 1 note
  - Bar 2: OO-- → 2 notes
  - Bar 3: ---O → 1 note
  - Bar 4: -OO- → 2 notes
  Total K = 6 notes

- S (Snare drum):
  - Bar 3: S--- → 1 note
  Total S = 1 note

- H (Hihat):
  Each bar: x-x- (2 notes per bar)
  4 bars × 2 = 8 notes
  Total H = 8 notes

- T (Toms):
  - Bar 3: ---O → 1 note
  Total T = 1 note

- C (Crash cymbal):
  Each bar: O--- (1 note per bar)
  4 bars × 1 = 4 notes
  Total C = 4 notes

- R (Ride cymbal): all dashes → 0 notes

Sum total notes:
K: 6 + S:1 + H:8 + T:1 + C:4 = 20 notes

The request is to reduce to no more than 8 notes total.

**Considering the feel:**

- The hihat is often a consistent pattern, but here it alone has 8 notes, which already meets the limit.
- Crash cymbals are generally emphasizing key points, but 4 crashes in 4 bars is a lot.
- Kick drums have 6 notes plus snare, toms, and crashes.

---

**Strategy:**

- Since the note limit is tight, focus on a minimal groove.
- Keep some hihat to maintain pulse, but reduce crashes or remove.
- Reduce kick and snare to essentials.
- Possibly remove toms.
- I will keep hihat at 8 notes (x-x- pattern runs consistently), as removing it would leave us with too few notes for groove.
- Then add 1 or 2 notes of kick or snare to keep rhythm interesting, but total ≤ 8
- No toms and crash cymbals to reduce note count.

---

Let's try:

- Keep hihat as is (8 notes)
- Remove crash cymbal: 0 notes
- Remove toms: 0 notes
- Remove kick and snare: 0 notes

Total notes: 8 notes (all hihats)

Alternatively, if we want 1 or 2 kicks or snares, we can reduce hihats a bit and add them.

Example: 

- Hihat: reduce from 8 to 6 notes (drop 2 closed hits)
- Kick: 1 or 2 notes
- Snare: 1 note

Let me balance it.

One possible pattern:

Hihat: x---|x---|x---|x--- (4 notes total)  
Kick: O---|----|O---|---- (2 notes)  
Snare: ----|S---|----|---- (1 note)  
Crash: ----|----|----|---- (0 notes)  
Toms: ----|----|----|---- (0 notes)  
Ride: ----|----|----|---- (0 notes)  

Sum total: 4 (H) + 2 (K) + 1 (S) = 7 notes total, under 8.

This is a simple groove with few notes, maintaining some groove pulse.

I'll present this as the final answer.
