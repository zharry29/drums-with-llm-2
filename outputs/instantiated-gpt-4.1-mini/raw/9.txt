Let's count the current notes in the groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----  
- Beat 1: 2 notes (O at 1st and 4th 16th note)  
- Beat 3: 1 note (O at 3rd 16th note)  
Total K: 3 notes

S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o  
- Beat 2: 3 notes (O, o, o)  
- Beat 3: 1 note (o)  
- Beat 4: 2 notes (O, o)  
Total S: 6 notes

H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-  
- Each beat: 3 notes (X, -, x, - is 4 chars per beat?) Actually, the line is 'X-x-' per beat. The characters at positions: 1 (X), 2 (-), 3 (x), 4 (-). So notes at positions 1 and 3, so 2 notes per beat, 4 beats total = 8 notes.

So total notes currently:

K: 3  
S: 6  
H: 8  
Total: 17 notes, which is above the requested maximum of 8 notes.

To reduce the total notes to no more than 8, since the Hihat line alone has 8 notes, we need to either reduce hihat hits or other instruments.

The K and S lines could be trimmed to fewer notes; similarly, the HiHat may be simplified.

Considering that kick and snare are more prominent, we might keep some kick and snare notes, and reduce or remove most hihat hits.

Let's try this:

- Kick: reduce to 3 notes max (keep the 3 original kick notes)  
- Snare: reduce from 6 to 3 notes (maybe only keep main backbeat hits)  
- HiHat: reduce to 2 hits or remove to save notes  
- Toms, Crash, Ride: none are used, so no problem

Revising the groove:

K: O--O|----|----|----   (3 notes, dropping the third kick in beat 3)  
S: ----|----|--O-|----   (only 1 snare note on the "3rd beat", to keep rhythm minimal)  
H: ----|----|----|X---   (only 1 hihat note at first 16th note of 4th beat)  

Counting notes now:

K: 2  
S: 1  
H: 1  

That's 4 notes, less than 8, so maybe we can add a couple more snare or hihat hits.

Add snare notes on beat 2 and 4 to simulate a backbeat: snare on 2nd beat, 3rd 16th note (o), and on 4th beat, 3rd 16th note (o).

K: O--O|----|----|----   (2 notes)  
S: ----|--o-|----|--o-   (2 notes)  
H: ----|----|----|X---   (1 note)  

Total: 5 notes

Add 1 or 2 hihat closed hits (x) on the 1st 16th note of beats 1 and 3:

H: x---|----|x---|X---  

Now hihat hits = 3  
Total notes now: 2(kick) + 2(snare) + 3(hihat) = 7 notes, which is under 8.

This groove keeps some activity but is minimal.

Final groove:

K: O--O|----|----|----  
S: ----|--o-|----|--o-  
H: x---|----|x---|X---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

Now put this between @@@.
