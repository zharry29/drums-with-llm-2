The original groove is in 4/4 at a normal time, with one kick drum hit on beat 1 and beat 3, snare drum hits on beat 2 and beat 4, and hihat playing steady closed hits on each beat (every quarter note).

To make it double time means to double the tempo, or equivalently, to double the number of hits per bar, usually by changing the subdivision from quarter notes to eighth notes. For the groove:
- Kick drum originally hits at beats 1 and 3 (positions 1 and 9 in the 16-step sequence). In double time, we put kick hits on twice as many positions: 1, 5, 9, 13.
- Snare hits originally on beats 2 and 4 (positions 5 and 13). In double time, they will be placed on 3 and 7, and 11 and 15, or more simply 3, 7, 11, 15 positions to keep the backbeat feel doubled.
- Hihats originally hit on every beat (positions 1, 5, 9, 13 with X). In double time, hihats will hit on every 16th note (all positions 1 to 16), as the time is doubled.

Now, let's rewrite the pattern with the doubled hits.

Positions are enumerated as:
1  2  3  4 | 5  6  7  8 | 9  10 11 12 | 13 14 15 16

- Kick drum (K): original 1,9 --> double time: 1,5,9,13 → O at those positions.
- Snare drum (S): original 5,13 --> double time: 3,7,11,15 → O at those positions.
- Hihat (H): originally X at 1,5,9,13 → double time: X at all positions (x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x).
- Toms (T), Crash (C), Ride (R): no change, stay silent.

The final groove with these changes is:
