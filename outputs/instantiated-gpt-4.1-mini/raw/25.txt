The original groove has the hihat playing hard closed hits "X" on every downbeat (the first 16th note of each beat). The toms are not played at all in the original groove (all dashes).

Since the request is to replace the hihat with toms, I will move the "X" hits from the hihat line to the corresponding positions in the tom line. As toms only have "O" and "o" articulations (hard and soft open hits), and since the hihat hits were hard closed hits "X" on the downbeats, I will replace those with hard open tom hits "O".

I will leave all other instruments the same.

Here is the resulting groove:
