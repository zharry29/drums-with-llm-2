The original hihat pattern is quite repetitive, alternating between hard and soft closed hits on every 8th note.

To make the hihat pattern more varied, I can:
- Introduce some open hits (O or o).
- Change some hard hits (X) to soft hits (x) or vice versa.
- Add some rests (-) to create syncopation or rhythmic interest.

Here's a revised pattern keeping the same rhythmic structure but adding variation:

- In the first beat, I'll keep the strong start with X on the downbeat but replace the second closed hit with an open soft hit o.
- In the second beat, replace the first open hit with a hard open hit O and change some closed hits.
- In the third beat, add a rest instead of the second closed hit to create space.
- In the last beat, bring back a mix of hard and soft closed hits but add an open soft hit on the last 16th note.

This results in a more dynamic, varied hihat pattern while preserving the overall groove feel.
