The original groove has no hihat hits at all, which makes the rhythm feel less textured. To create a more varied hihat pattern, I'll add a mix of closed and open hits at different points in the bar for dynamics.

Here's my plan for the hihat line:
- Use mostly soft closed hits (x) for a steady pulse.
- Add some hard closed hits (X) on strong beats to add accents.
- Include a few soft open hits (o) and a hard open hit (O) for color and variation.
- Avoid oversaturating, so the hihat complements rather than overwhelms the groove.

I will place the hihat hits approximately on the upbeat 16th notes and some off-beats to create a nice syncopation.

Now let's produce the final groove with this updated hihat pattern.
