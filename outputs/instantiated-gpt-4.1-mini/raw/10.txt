The original groove has some 16th notes where no instruments are hit (denoted by '-'). The request is to have something played on every 16th note across the whole bar (16 notes). This means no character should be '-', every position on each row should have a hit.

Let's evaluate and fill each missing note with hits, respecting the instruments' articulation:

- Kick (K): Currently at positions 1, 7, 9, 11 (hard or soft). For missing hits, I can fill with soft hits 'o' to keep some dynamics.
- Snare (S): Currently only hit sparsely with 'O'. For missing hits, I can use 'o' for soft hits or 's' for soft sidesticks to add texture.
- Hihat (H): Currently alternating soft open 'o' and hard open 'O' hits. Hihat can use 'X' or 'x' for closed hits or 'O'/'o' for open hits. To avoid over-opening, I can fill remaining with soft closed 'x' hits where missing.
- Toms (T): Currently empty. I can add tom fills where missing, mixing hard 'O' and soft 'o'.
- Crash (C): Only one hit at start. Crashes are usually played sparingly. To avoid clutter, I can add soft open hits 'o' on off-beats.
- Ride (R): Not played in original. I can add soft or hard open ride hits 'o'/'O' to fill gaps.

Let's build the full groove line by line of 16 characters with no '-':

Positions:  1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 | 9 10 11 12 | 13 14 15 16

- Kick (K): O o o o | o o O o | O - O - | o o o o (fill missing with soft 'o')
  Make all positions hits: Let's assign 'O' on strong beats 1,7,9,11, soft 'o' on the rest
  So: O o o o | o o O o | O o O o | o o o o

- Snare (S): Current hits are O at positions 6 and 16
  Let's fill others with soft sidesticks 's' or soft hits 'o'
  
  For a Groove, snares typically hit on 2 and 4 beats, which correspond to positions 5 and 13 (16th notes 5 and 13)
  
  Let's assign hard 'O' on 6 and 16 (from original) and soft sidesticks 's' on others:
  
  Positions 1-4: s s s s
  Positions 5-8: o O s s
  Positions 9-12: s s s s
  Positions 13-16: o s s O

- Hihat (H): Currently open hits at many positions, adding closed hits for filling

  Let's keep the pattern close to original with "o" open hits on 3,5,7 etc.

  For missing marks, add soft closed 'x'

  Positions 1-4: x o o o

  Positions 5-8: O o O o

  Positions 9-12: O o O o

  Positions 13-16: O o O o

- Toms (T): Add tom hits alternating between hard 'O' and soft 'o'

  Positions: O o O o | o O o O | O o O o | o O o O

- Crash (C): Add crash on downbeats 1, 5, 9, and 13, use 'O' for hard

  Positions 1-4: O o o o

  Positions 5-8: O o o o

  Positions 9-12: O o o o

  Positions 13-16: O o o o

- Ride (R): Similarly fill the ride with soft open hits on all notes: 'o'

  Positions 1-16: o o o o | o o o o | o o o o | o o o o

Now let's write the entire groove in notation with 16 note hits per instrument line.

Final groove:

K: Oo oo Oo o|oo Oo Oo o|Oo Oo Oo o|oooo oooo

S: ssss|oOs s|ssss|os sO

H: xooo|OoOo|OoOo|OoOo

T: OoOo|oOoO|OoOo|oOoO

C: Oooo|Oooo|Oooo|Oooo

R: oooo|oooo|oooo|oooo

Convert to notation form with the '|' every 4 notes and no spaces.

For clarity:

K: O o o o | o o O o | O o O o | o o o o → "Oo oo Oo o|oo Oo Oo o|Oo Oo Oo o|oooo oooo"

But need to convert spaces to nothing and write everything adjacent:

Let's do it with no spaces and vertical bars exactly at every 4 chars (note that a 16 note bar = 16 chars, excluding '|'). Spaces are removed:

K: Oo oo Oo o => Oo oo Oo o (remove spaces) → Oo ooOo o → oops, spaces in 'oo Oo' means interpreting carefully

Better to do it sequentially:

Positions 1-4: O (pos1), o (2), o(3), o(4) → "Oooo"

Positions 5-8: o(5), o(6), O(7), o(8) → "ooOo"

Positions 9-12: O(9), o(10), O(11), o(12) → "OoOo"

Positions 13-16: o(13), o(14), o(15), o(16) → "oooo"

So final K line:

K: Oooo|ooOo|OoOo|oooo

Similarly for S:

Positions 1-4: s s s s → "ssss"

5-8: o O s s → "oOss"

9-12: s s s s → "ssss"

13-16: o s s O → "ossO"

S: ssss|oOss|ssss|ossO

H:

1-4: x o o o → "xooo"

5-8: O o O o → "OoOo"

9-12: O o O o → "OoOo"

13-16: O o O o → "OoOo"

H: xooo|OoOo|OoOo|OoOo

T:

1-4: O o O o → "OoOo"

5-8: o O o O → "oOoO"

9-12: O o O o → "OoOo"

13-16: o O o O → "oOoO"

T: OoOo|oOoO|OoOo|oOoO

C:

1-4: O o o o → "Oooo"

5-8: O o o o → "Oooo"

9-12: O o o o → "Oooo"

13-16: O o o o → "Oooo"

C: Oooo|Oooo|Oooo|Oooo

R:

All soft open hits 'o': 16 times 'o'

Break into 4 groups:

oooo|oooo|oooo|oooo

R: oooo|oooo|oooo|oooo

Now compose the final groove notation:

K: Oooo|ooOo|OoOo|oooo
S: ssss|oOss|ssss|ossO
H: xooo|OoOo|OoOo|OoOo
T: OoOo|oOoO|OoOo|oOoO
C: Oooo|Oooo|Oooo|Oooo
R: oooo|oooo|oooo|oooo
