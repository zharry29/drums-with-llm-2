To make this groove sound more like metal, I'll want to introduce some heavier and more complex rhythms, especially on the kick, snare, and toms. Metal grooves often utilize fast double kicks, aggressive snare hits, and tom fills. Cymbals like crash and ride can also feature prominently for accents.

Current groove:
- Kick on the 1 and 3 of first and third beats
- Snare on the 2 and 4 of the second and fourth beats
- Hihat plays steady straight 8th notes (closed hits)
- No toms, no cymbals currently

For metal:
- I'll add double kick patterns (fast notes on kick)
- Snare hits remain strong on 2 and 4, but possibly adding extra snare hits or ghost notes
- Tom fills in the last beat or two to add heaviness
- Add crash cymbal accent on the first beat of the bar
- Keep hihat closed but maybe make it more aggressive by using the hard hit 'X' consistently and possibly include some open hi-hat hits for a sharp sound

Here's the planned changes:
- Kick: more rapid hits, possibly playing sixteenth notes on first beat
- Snare: strong hits on 2 and 4 (hard open hits ‘O’ for power)
- Hihat: steady eighth notes with some open hits to add aggression
- Toms: hits on beats 3 and 4 for a fill
- Crash: hit on the first downbeat of the bar
- Ride: none, keep it empty

Now I'll write the new groove:
