Disco drum beats typically have a steady four-on-the-floor kick drum pattern, meaning the kick hits on every beat (every quarter note). The snare usually hits on beats 2 and 4 (backbeat), and the hi-hat often plays a steady eighth-note pulse, frequently open a bit for that disco shimmer.

Starting from the given groove:

- The original Kick hits only on beat 1 (first sixteenth note of each bar 1 and 3).
- The Snare hits on beat 2 (bar 2) and bar 4, beat 1 in the group of 4 sixteenths.
- The Hi-hat plays hard closed hits once per beat (on the quarter notes).
- Toms, Crash, and Ride are silent.

To make this groove sound more disco:

1. Kick: add kick hits on every quarter note (every 4 sixteenths).
2. Snare: ensure snare hits on beats 2 and 4 (sixteenth positions 5 and 13).
3. Hi-hat: play steady eighth notes with a slight variation maybe open hi-hats on off-beats.
4. Optionally, use crash or ride cymbal hits to accent the beginning of phrases.

Implementing this:

- Kick: O---|O---|O---|O--- (every beat)
- Snare: ----|O---|----|O--- (beats 2 and 4)
- Hi-hat: play eighth notes with closed hi-hat (X for hard closed on the down beats and o for soft open on off beats would fit disco). So, say, XoXo|XoXo|XoXo|XoXo
- Leave Toms silent.
- Add a crash cymbal hit on the first beat to accent phrase starts.

Putting together:

Kick: O---|O---|O---|O---

Snare: ----|O---|----|O---

Hi-hat: XoXo|XoXo|XoXo|XoXo

Crash: O---|----|----|----

Ride: ----|----|----|----

This should give a steady disco groove.

Now I'll write this drum groove as requested.
