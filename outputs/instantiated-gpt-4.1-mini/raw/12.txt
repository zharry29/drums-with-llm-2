Let's analyze the given groove and the request:

Current groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The instruction says: "I don't want ride on beat 4 but everything else is fine."

In the current groove, the Ride (R) line is empty, meaning no ride hits at all, including beat 4. This means the ride drum is not played on any beat, particularly no ride on beat 4.

Since the request is "I don't want ride on beat 4," this implies there might have been a previous ride hit on beat 4 in the original but at present the Ride line is empty, so the current groove does not include any ride hits.

Therefore, the groove is already fulfilling the request. But since the instruction was given, maybe the original groove (the part the user gave) had ride hits and this groove is the post-edited one.

In any case, the request wants to keep everything else the same except no ride on beat 4.

Hence, the final groove is the same as the provided groove but with no ride on beat 4.

Therefore, the final output is exactly the same as the input groove:
