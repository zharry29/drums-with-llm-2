Let's examine the original groove:

The edit request says: "I don't want tom on beat 4 but everything else is fine."

Looking closely, the tom line (T:) in the original groove is

T: ----|----|----|----

There are no tom hits at all, including beat 4. So the tom is already silent on beat 4.

Since they said "I don't want tom on beat 4" but there are no toms at all, the groove can remain unchanged.

Hence, the final result is the same groove as original.
