The original groove has the snare played on the second beat (the backbeat) with "O---" on the second measure (second group of 4 characters):

S: ----|O---|----|O---

The request is to delay the first snare backbeat by an 8th note. This means the snare hit should be moved half a beat later.

An 8th note is two 16th notes, so delaying by an 8th note means shifting the snare hit two 16th notes to the right.

Currently, the snare hit is at the 1st 16th note of beat 2 (index 4 of the measure). We will move this snare hit to index 6.

So, the new snare line will have the snare hit at position 6 instead of 4 for the first snare backbeat.

Let's apply this change:

Original S second measure: O---

Positions: 4 5 6 7 in the bar

Currently: O--- (snare on pos 4)

After shift: --O- (snare on pos 6)

Similarly, the second snare hit on beat 4 remains unchanged at the beginning of the fourth measure.

The rest of the groove stays the same.

Final groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|--O-|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

Now, I will output the final groove.
