Let's analyze the groove and the edit request:

Original groove:
K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

The snare has hits on the 2nd beat (second 4 characters) and 4th beat (fourth 4 characters).

Request: "Displace the first snare backbeat by delaying an 8-th note."

- The first snare backbeat is the hit on the 2nd beat at the 1st 16th note in the second group of four dashes: "O---"
- Delaying by an 8th note means moving the hit one 8th note later (1 8th note = 2 16th notes)
- So originally: S line: ----|O---|----|O---
- Positions (counting 16th notes in 1 bar): The "O" is at the 5th position (the first position after the |), moving it back by 2 positions would be position 7.

Positions in the second beat are 5,6,7,8 (the 4 sixteenth notes in that beat)
Original: O at pos 5
After delay: O at pos 7

So the second beat becomes: --O-

Final groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|--O-|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

Now write it in the required format.
