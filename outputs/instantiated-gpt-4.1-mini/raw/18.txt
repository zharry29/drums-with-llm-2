Ghost notes on the Snare drum usually refer to very soft hits, often notated as "o" in this context. The current Snare part has quite a few 'o' hits already, but to emphasize ghost notes, I can add some quiet snare hits on the weaker off-beats or in between main hits.

Looking at the existing Snare pattern:
- |Oo-o| has already some soft hits.
- | -o-- and |O--o have some softer hits.

I can add a few additional soft hits (o) between these existing notes to give it more groove.

For example:
- In the first bar, Snare has no hits, I can add some quiet ghost notes there.
- In bar three, currently only 1 soft hit on the second 16th note after the bar starts, add another quiet hit in a position like the 4th or 8th 16th note.
  
I'll distribute soft hits (o) so they do not clash with major hits but fill in spaces to create a ghost note effect.

Here is my edited groove:
