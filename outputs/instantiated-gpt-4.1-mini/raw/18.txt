The given groove currently has no hits on the Snare except for the 3rd beat, where there's a hard hit (O). To add ghost notes on the Snare, we typically use soft hits, represented by "o" or soft sidestick hits "x". I'll add some soft ghost notes ("o") in the spaces where the Snare is currently silent, making sure to place them off the main beats to keep the groove interesting and natural.

Let's add soft snare ghost notes on the 2nd and 4th beats, slightly before or after the main hits and on the 1st beat to complement the kick pattern:

- Add a soft ghost note on the Snare at the second 16th note of the 1st beat.
- Add a soft ghost note on the Snare at the third 16th note of the 2nd beat.
- Add a soft ghost note on the Snare at the second 16th note of the 4th beat.

This will add subtle rhythmic texture without overpowering the groove.

Here's the updated groove:
