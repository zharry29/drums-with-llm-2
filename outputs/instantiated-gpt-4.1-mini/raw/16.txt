The original groove has the hihat part as "x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-", with hard closed hits (x) on some 16-th notes.

The request is to:
- Play the closed hihat on all 8th notes: There are 8 eighth notes in a bar, so hits on every 2nd 16th note.
- But open on every up beat: The downbeats are 1, 2, 3, 4, each of which is a quarter note, so the upbeats are the offbeats between these quarter notes, i.e. the "and" beats.
- Keep hits hard.

So the hihat pattern will be:
- Each 8th note gets a hit.
- On downbeats (1, 2, 3, 4) the note is a closed hit (X)
- On upbeats (the offbeat eighth notes) the note is a hard open hit (O).

Mapping this to the 16 16th notes per bar:
- For the 16 sixteenth notes, indices are 1 to 16:
- 8th notes at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15
- Downbeats (1, 5, 9, 13): closed hit hard = X
- Upbeats (3, 7, 11, 15): open hit hard = O

So the hihat line will be:

Index:  1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 | 9 10 11 12 | 13 14 15 16
H:      X - O - | X - O - | X  -  O  - | X  -  O  -

Replaced dashes at those positions so the pattern is:

X - O -|X - O -|X - O -|X - O -

Now let's build the entire groove. The other instruments remain unchanged.

Original groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

Modified groove (only H changes):

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: X-O-|X-O-|X-O-|X-O-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
