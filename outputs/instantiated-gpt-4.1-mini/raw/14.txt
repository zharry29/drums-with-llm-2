The original groove "K:" line is:
OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO

Here each character corresponds to a 16th note (16 characters per bar excluding the "|"). The bar length is 16 16th notes, and "|" marks every 4 notes (one beat).

The request is to "fill up the whole bar with double kick."

Double kick means the kick drum plays on every 16th note, i.e., every position should be filled with "O" for the kick drum line.

So instead of the original pattern:  
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO

We replace all 16 characters (4 beats Ã— 4 sixteenth notes each) with "O" for the kick drum. That makes:

K: OOOO|OOOO|OOOO|OOOO

The rest of the instruments remain unchanged.

Let's keep the original other parts unchanged:

S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

This is the final groove:
