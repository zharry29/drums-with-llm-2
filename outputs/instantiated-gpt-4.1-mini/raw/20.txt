To create a more funky beat, I'll add some ghost (soft) snare hits, add some syncopation on the kick drum, and add some open hi-hat hits for added groove. I'll also try to add some subtle tom hits for movement.

Let's start by modifying the kick to add a syncopated hit on the "and" of 2 and "and" of 3.
Add ghost snare hits to create groove and add open hi-hat on "and" of 2 and "and" of 4.
Add tom hits on the "and" of 3.
Keep crash and ride empty for now to maintain focus on groove.

Here's the edited funky beat:
