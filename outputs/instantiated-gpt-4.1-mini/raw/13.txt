The current groove has a moderate number of notes spread across Kick, Snare, Hihat, and Ride cymbal. Since the request is "Less notes," I'll reduce the number of hits while keeping the groove coherent and still musical.

Steps:
- Kick: Currently played 4 times (soft hits). I will reduce it to 2 hits for a sparser groove.
- Snare: 2 hard sidesticks in the pattern. I will leave the first one to keep the groove grounded but remove the second Snare hit.
- Hihat: Currently two soft closed hits. I will remove one to simplify.
- Ride: Frequently played in a syncopated pattern. I will reduce the ride notes by half.

The new groove would look like this:

K: o---|----|o---|----
S: ----|S---|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|----|x---|----

This keeps a minimal but steady rhythm with fewer notes.
