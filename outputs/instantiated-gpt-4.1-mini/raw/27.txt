Low frequency sounds typically come from the kick drum and the toms. The current groove has kick hits on some downbeats and offbeats, but no toms.

To increase low frequency content, I can:
- Add more kick drum hits, especially on offbeats and 16th notes.
- Introduce tom hits to fill some spaces where no low hits occur.
- Keep some variation to maintain groove feel.

Let's analyze where kicks could be added:
- Bar 1: K: O--O (kick on 1 and the "and" of 2), add a kick on the "e" of 1 and the "a" of 4.
- Bar 2: none currently, add low toms or kicks on 1, the "and" of 2, and possibly 3.
- Bar 3: kick on the "and" of 2, add kicks on downbeats 1 and 3.
- Bar 4: no kicks, add a kick on beat 1.

I'll also add toms (T) in low-pitched hits to complement kicks on some beats for more low frequency variety.

Here's the new groove with added kicks and tom hits:
