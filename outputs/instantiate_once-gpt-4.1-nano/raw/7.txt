Certainly! Feathering the kick drum involves softening the hits, typically by reducing the accent or volume. In notation, this is represented by changing the hard hit "O" to a softer "o". Since the original groove has "O" hits on beats 1 and 3, I will convert those to softer "o" hits to create a feathered (softer) effect for the kick drum. Here's the revised drum groove:

K: o---|----|o---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Would you like me to make it more subtle or more pronounced, or add any other elements?
