Certainly! I will remove the ride (R) and hi-hat (H) parts from the original groove and keep the rest of the instruments intact, creating a new drum pattern without those instruments.

Here's the updated drum groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This version excludes the ride and hi-hat, as requested, leaving the kick, snare, toms, and cymbals (none played here) intact.
