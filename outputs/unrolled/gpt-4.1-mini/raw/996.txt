The request is to add closed hi-hat hits on all 16th notes, with accents on the quarter note downbeats.

Notation reminder for hi-hat:  
- `X` = hard closed hit (accented)  
- `x` = soft closed hit (unaccented)

There are 16 16th notes in the bar; positions 1, 5, 9, and 13 correspond to quarter note downbeats and should get `X`, the others get `x`.

Other parts remain unchanged.
