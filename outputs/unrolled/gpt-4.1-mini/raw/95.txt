The original groove includes:  
- Kick hits on beats 1 (bars 1, 2, and 4).  
- Snare hit on downbeat of beat 3.  
- Toms playing a consistent pattern of hard and soft hits evenly distributed.  
- No hi-hat or cymbals.

---

**Request:** Add hi-hat to the groove which currently only has kick and toms.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add hi-hat closed hits (`x` for soft closed) on every 8th note (positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15) to provide steady pulse.  
- Keep the rest unchanged.
