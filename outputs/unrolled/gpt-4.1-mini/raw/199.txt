The original groove has kick, snare hits on beats 2 and 4, and crashes at the downbeats, but no hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add a consistent hi-hat pattern to complement the groove.  
- Use soft closed hi-hat hits ('x') on the offbeats or steady 8th notes to keep rhythm flowing.  
- Keep all other parts unchanged.
