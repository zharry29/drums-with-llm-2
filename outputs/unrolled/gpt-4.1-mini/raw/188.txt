The original groove features ride cymbal hits (soft and hard closed hits on the bow) and some closed hi-hat hits, but no tom or other drum hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add some tom hits ('O' for hard hits) to complement the existing ride pattern.  
- Place tom hits sparsely to maintain space and groove clarityâ€”perhaps adding tom hits on the "and" of 2 or 3 to create rhythmic interest.  
- Keep the ride and hi-hat pattern as is.
