The current groove features:
- Kick drum on beats 1 and 4, and some soft hits.
- Snare hit on beat 3 downbeat.
- Toms playing a consistent pattern.
- No hi-hat or ride cymbal currently.

---

**Request:** Add both ride cymbal *and* hi-hat to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add a ride cymbal pattern with soft closed hits (`x`) on beats (positions 1,5,9,13) to give a steady pulse without overpowering.  
- Add a hi-hat pattern with soft closed hits (`x`) on the offbeats (the "and" of each beat, e.g. positions 3,7,11,15) to complement the ride and give groove.  
- This gives both ride and hi-hat presence.

---

Final lines for cymbals:
- Hihat: `-x-x|-x-x|-x-x|-x-x` (closed soft hits alternating offbeats)  
- Ride: `x---|x---|x---|x---` (closed soft hits on downbeats)
