The original groove:

```
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a tom hit and kick in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Kick (K) line at the very beginning is 'O', so already a hard kick hit present.
- Tom (T) line at the very beginning is 'O' (hard hit) â€” there's a tom hit at the start already.
- Since they want a tom hit and kick specifically in the very beginning, and both are already present, no changes are strictly necessary.
- However, for emphasis, we can strengthen the kick hit if it were soft or absent, but it's already 'O'.
- Similarly, tom is already 'O', so no change.
- Final groove remains the same.
