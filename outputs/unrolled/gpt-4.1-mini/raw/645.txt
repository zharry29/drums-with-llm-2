The original groove:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

Request: "I'd like a ride hit and tom in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Ride cymbal (R) first character is "x" (soft closed hit), so a ride hit is already present â€” but since the request is explicit, keep it as is or upgrade to a harder articulation "X" (hard closed hit).
- Tom (T) first character is "-", so add a tom at the first 16th note with a hard hit "O".
- Other parts remain unchanged.
