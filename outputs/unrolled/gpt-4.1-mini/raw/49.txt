The given groove currently has:  
- Ride cymbal playing a varied pattern of closed bow hits ('x' and 'X' alternating with some rests).  
- Hi-hat plays just two soft closed hits (‘x’) in positions 6 and 16 (the second 16th note of beat 2 and beat 4).  
- Kick, snare, toms, crash are silent.

---

**Request:** Add some hi-hat to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The hi-hat is very sparse currently.  
- To add texture and rhythmic drive, I will add a steady soft closed hi-hat (‘x’) pattern on the 8th notes (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15) throughout the measure.  
- This aligns well with the ride pattern and fills out the groove nicely.  
- Since there are already two soft hi-hats at positions 6 and 16, I will keep those and add the new hits on all odd 16th notes (off-beats in the 16th note grid).

---

Final hi-hat pattern (X marks hits):  
Positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15: x  
Positions 6,16: x (as original)  

But position 6 conflicts with odd 16th hits only. So final is:

Positions 1,3,5,6,7,9,11,13,15,16 = x  
Others = -

Wait, that's more hits than possible because of limitation to 16 characters.

I will combine as:

- Add 'x' on all odd 16th notes (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15)

- Keep original hits at positions 6 and 16

Result:  
Positions 1,3,5,6,7,9,11,13,15,16 = x

Specifically: 1,3,5,6,7,9,11,13,15,16 -> x  
Total hits: 10 hits.

Accordingly, line looks like:

`x-xxx|x-x-x|x-x-x|xx-x-`

Double checking:

Positions per beat:  
Beat 1 (pos 1-4): 1:x,2:-,3:x,4:x  
Beat 2 (pos 5-8): 5:x,6:x,7:x,8:-  
Beat3 (pos 9-12): 9:x,10:-,11:x,12:-  
Beat4 (pos 13-16): 13:x,14:-,15:x,16:x

This gives a nice driving groove.
