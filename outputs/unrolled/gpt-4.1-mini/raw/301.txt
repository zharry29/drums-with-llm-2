The original groove includes kick, snare, and hi-hat, but no ride. The request wants the groove to have **not only ride but also snare**. Since there's already snare present, I need to **add ride cymbal hits** while keeping the existing snare.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the kick, snare, and hi-hat patterns as is.  
- Add ride cymbal pattern on steady 8th notes with hard and soft closed hits (`x` and `X`).  
- Leave tom and crash empty as original.
