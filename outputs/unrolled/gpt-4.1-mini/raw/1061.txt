Let's analyze the kick (K) pattern:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
```

Breakdown:

- Beat 1: `O--O` → hard hits on 1st and 4th 16th notes  
- Beat 2: `----` → no kicks  
- Beat 3: `--O-` → hard hit on 3rd 16th note  
- Beat 4: `----` → no kicks

---

**Goal:** keep the same placement but add more dynamics.

Since all kicks are hard hits (`O`), we can introduce dynamics by changing some to soft hits (`o`) on the same positions to add variation.

Proposed changes:

- Beat 1: soften the 4th 16th note from `O` to `o`  
- Beat 3: soften the 3rd 16th note from `O` to `o`

New kick pattern:

```
K: O--o|----|--o-|----
```
