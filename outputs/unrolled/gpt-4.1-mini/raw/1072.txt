Let's analyze the snare (S) line in the original groove:

```
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
```

— Beat 1: no hits

— Beat 2: hard sidestick (`X`) on 1st 16th note

— Beat 3: hard sidestick (`X`) on 3rd 16th note

— Beat 4: no hits

---

**Request:** Add ghost notes on the snare.

Ghost notes on snare are soft hits, usually soft open hits (`o`) or soft sidesticks (`x`). Since the main hits are sidesticks (`X`), the ghost notes will be softer sidesticks (`x`).

---

### Plan:

- Add soft ghost sidesticks (`x`) on off-beats, preferably near main hits to keep groove subtle and dynamic.

- For beat 2, add ghost on 3rd 16th note → beat 2: `X-x-`

- For beat 3, add ghost on 2nd 16th note → beat 3: `-xX-`

- For beat 1 and 4, optionally add very soft ghost hits if it fits.

- To keep it minimal, only add these two ghost notes near existing hits.

---

### Implementation:

- Beat 2: 4 chars → from `X---` to `X-x-`

- Beat 3: from `--X-` to `-xX-`

---

Final snare line:

```
S: ----|X-x-| -xX-|----
```

Removing spaces:

```
S: ----|X-x-|-xX-|----
```
