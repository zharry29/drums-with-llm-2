The request is to remove hi-hat and tom hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Hi-hat line (`H`) contains soft closed hi-hat hits (`x`), so these should be replaced with `-`.  
- Tom line (`T`) is already empty, so no changes needed there.  
- Other lines contain only ride hits or are empty; leave them as is.
