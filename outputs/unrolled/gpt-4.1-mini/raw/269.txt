The original groove here already has closed hi-hat (x) on every 8th note and crash cymbal (O) on every downbeat (1, 5, 9, 13). The snare line uses an invalid character `S`, which is not defined in the notation, so I will replace it with a valid snare hit, e.g., `O` on the expected snare backbeat (beat 3).

The request is for the groove to have not only cymbal but also hi-hat, which it already does in closed hi-hat. So I will keep the hi-hat as `x-x-` pattern, keep the crash cymbal on downbeats, and fix the snare line with a proper snare hit.
