The original groove has kick hits prominently on beats 1 and 2 of bars 1 and 2 and on beat 4 of bar 1, and a snare hit only on beat 3 of bar 3. The toms have a consistent pattern but no hi-hat or cymbals. The request asks to have not only kick but also snare, so the snare presence is currently minimal and should be enhanced.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Increase presence of snare hits, especially on the typical backbeat positions: beats 2 and 4.  
- Add snare hits on beats 2 and 4 to complement kick hits and create a fuller groove.  
- Maintain kicks and toms as they are.  
- No hi-hat or cymbals to keep the original character.
