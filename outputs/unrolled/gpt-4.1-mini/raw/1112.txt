The "a" of the second beat corresponds to the 4th 16th note of beat 2. Counting 16th notes starting from 0, the second beat covers positions 4, 5, 6, 7:
- 4 = 1
- 5 = e
- 6 = &
- 7 = a

I need to add a cymbal hit at position 7.

Currently, Crash (C) has no hits; Ride (R) has hits on positions 0, 1, and 3 of beat 2: `X-x-`.

To add the requested cymbal hit, I will put a hard crash cymbal hit "O" on position 7 in Crash (C). The rest will stay the same.
