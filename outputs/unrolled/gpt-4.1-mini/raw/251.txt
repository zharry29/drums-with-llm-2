The original groove features kick, snare on beats 2 and 4, and consistent crash cymbal hits, but no hi-hat or toms.

**Thought process:**  
- The request asks for not only hi-hat but also tom, so I will add hi-hat and toms accordingly.  
- Add closed hi-hat hits (`x`) on eighth notes to create a steady pulse.  
- Add tom hits (mix of soft `o` and hard `O`) to enrich the groove on some offbeats or to fill gaps between snare and kick hits.  
- Keep kick, snare, and crash parts intact.
