The original groove:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

Request: "I'd like a kick hit and ride in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Very beginning means the first 16th note.
- Kick drum (K) first character is "-", so add a hard kick hit "O".
- Ride cymbal (R) first character is "x" (soft closed ride hit), we want a ride in the beginning, so a closed hit "X" (hard closed ride) may fit better.
  However, since "x" is already a ride hit, ride is present.
- The user asked for "kick hit and ride"; both are present, but to emphasize the ride hit, let's upgrade the soft "x" to hard "X".
- Other lines remain unchanged.
