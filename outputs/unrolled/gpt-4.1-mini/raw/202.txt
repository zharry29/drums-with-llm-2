The original groove has kick and snare parts with a mix of soft and open snare hits, and hi-hat with hard (X) and soft (x) closed hits on the bow. The request states the groove should have not only snare but also hi-hat. Since hi-hat is already present (X-x pattern), I will enhance the hi-hat pattern slightly by adding a few more hi-hat hits on some offbeats to make the hi-hat presence clearer.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the snare as is to retain its dynamics.  
- Enrich the hi-hat pattern by filling some 16th-notes with additional soft closed hits (x) for groove motion.  
- Keep kicks and other parts unchanged.
