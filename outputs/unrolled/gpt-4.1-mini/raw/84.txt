The current groove has:  
- Kick plays a busy pattern mostly on downbeats and some offbeats.  
- Snare hits on beat 2 of bar 2 and beat 2 of bar 4.  
- Crash cymbal hits on every downbeat (1, 5, 9, 13).  
- No hi-hat or toms.  
- No ride cymbal.

---

**Request:** Groove should have **not only cymbal but also tom**.  
Currently, only crash cymbal and no toms.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits to complement the kick and snare without cluttering the groove.  
- Place tom hits as soft hits (`o`) on 3rd 16th note of the 3rd bar (position 3), and 11th 16th note in the 4th bar (position 11), accentuating groove groove subdivisions.  
- Keep all other parts intact.
