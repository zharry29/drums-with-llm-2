The original groove has no tom hits (T: all dashes). To add some tom hits, I'll incorporate toms in a way that complements the existing rhythm without overcrowding it.

The groove currently:
- Kick has hits on 1, the "and" of 1, and the "e" of 3
- Snare plays mostly on beats 2 and 4 with some ghost notes
- Hihat plays constant 16th notes with alternating hard and soft closed hits

Idea for toms:
- Add some tom hits on the backbeats or in between kicks and snares. 
- Since the tom is often used for fills or accents, I'll add some light tom hits on the "a" of 2 and possibly around beat 3 to add some texture.

Let's place tom hits (hard 'O') on the last 16th note of beat 2 (the "a"), and a couple of soft 'o' hits in beat 3 or 4 for flavor.

For example:
- Beat 2 (positions 5-8): add a tom on position 8 (the "a") as a hard hit (O)
- Beat 3 (positions 9-12): add soft tom hits on positions 10 and 12 (the "e" and "a")
- Beat 4 (positions 13-16): add a soft tom hit on position 14 (the "e")

This way the tom fills some gaps and adds rhythmic interest.
