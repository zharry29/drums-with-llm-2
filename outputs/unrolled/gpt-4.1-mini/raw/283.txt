The original groove has kick, snare with some open and soft hits, and a closed hi-hat pattern, but no ride cymbal. The edit request asks for both snare and ride. Snare is present, so I will add a ride cymbal pattern to complement the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kick pattern unchanged.  
- Keep snare pattern unchanged.  
- Keep hi-hat pattern unchanged.  
- Add ride cymbal closed hits (`x`) on the off-beats (every 2nd 16th note, steady 8ths) to fill out the ride presence.
