The original cymbal line is:

```
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
```

There is a hard crash hit (`O`) on the first 16th note of every beat, totaling 4 hits in the bar.

To keep the same placement but make the cymbal hits more dynamic, I can alter the articulation between hard hits (`O`) and soft hits (`o`), and possibly add a soft hit immediately after existing hits to add texture, while keeping the placements intact.

Here's a plan for each beat:

- Beat 1: `O---` → `Oo--` (hard hit plus soft hit right after)
- Beat 2: `O---` → `oO--` (soft hit before hard)
- Beat 3: `O---` → `Oo--` (hard + soft)
- Beat 4: `O---` → `oO--`

Full modified cymbal line:

```
C: Oo--|oO--|Oo--|oO--
```

This keeps all hits on the first 16th note of each beat, adds dynamic variation with alternating hard and soft hits and some layering.
