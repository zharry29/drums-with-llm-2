The original groove has a very active kick pattern (line K) and snare hits only on beat 2 of bar 2 and beat 4 of bar 4. The groove also features crash cymbals on every downbeat. The request asks that the groove should have not only kick but also snare, which is already true, but the snare presence is sparse.

**Thought process:**  
- Increase snare presence by adding more hits, especially emphasizing beats 2 and 4 where snares commonly fall.  
- Keep the energetic kick pattern as is.  
- Keep crashes as is.
