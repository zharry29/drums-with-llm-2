The original groove has:  
- No kick or snare hits.  
- Hihat soft closed hits on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4 (positions 6 and 16).  
- Ride cymbal alternating soft and hard closed hits on the bow.

**Request:** Add some snare to the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- Adding snare hits will give more rhythmic definition.  
- To keep it subtle (since no kick present), I'll add soft snare hits ('o') on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4, matching the hihat hits positions.  
- Additionally, add a hard snare hit ('O') on the downbeat of beat 3 (position 9) for a strong backbeat feel.

Snare line:  
Positions 6 and 16: 'o' (soft open hits), position 9: 'O' (hard hit)
