The original groove already has a crash cymbal hit (`O`) on the first 16th note of beat 1 only. The request asks to have "not only kick but also cymbal," so we can add some cymbal hits to make it clearer.

**Thought process:**  
- The crash cymbal hit on beat 1 is good.  
- Adding more cymbal hits on downbeats 3 (position 9) will create more presence.  
- Maybe add a soft cymbal hit (`o`) on beat 4 offbeat (position 14) to add texture without overwhelming.

Final cymbal line:  
`O---|----|O---|---o`
