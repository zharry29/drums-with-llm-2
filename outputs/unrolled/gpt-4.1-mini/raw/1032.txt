The original ride cymbal line is:

```
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
```

This has a recurring pattern every beat with:

- 1st 16th note: soft closed hit on bow (`o`)  
- 2nd 16th note: hard open hit on bell (`-` actually `-` is empty?), no, see the notation carefully:

Positions per beat:

1st 16th note: `o` (soft closed)  
2nd 16th note: `-` (silence)  
3rd 16th note: `O` (hard open on bell)  
4th 16th note: `-` (silence)  

So for every beat, hits on 1st (soft closed) and 3rd (hard open bell) 16th notes.

To keep the same placement but make it more dynamic:

- I can vary articulation or add additional hits between existing hits, but only on same 16th notes as current ones.  
- For the 1st 16th note of each beat, I can alternate between soft closed (`o`) and hard closed (`X`), or add accents.  
- For the 3rd 16th note, alternate between hard open (`O`) and soft open (`o`).

Updated ride line, alternating:

Beat 1: `o-O-` → `X-oO` (hard closed, soft open bell)  
Beat 2: `o-O-` → `o-Oo` (soft closed, hard open, soft open)  
Beat 3: `o-O-` → `X-oO`  
Beat 4: `o-O-` → `o-Oo`

Final ride cymbal pattern:

```
R: X-oO|o-Oo|X-oO|o-Oo
```

This keeps exact placement but adds dynamic variation with alternating hit strengths and added soft open hits.
