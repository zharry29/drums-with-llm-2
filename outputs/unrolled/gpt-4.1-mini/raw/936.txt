The request is to remove snare hits on beat 4 (positions 13-16), keeping everything else unchanged.

Looking at the snare line (S) on beat 4:

- Beat 4: `O--o` â†’ there is a hard snare hit ('O') on the first 16th note and a soft open snare hit ('o') on the fourth 16th note.

Removing snare means replacing these 4 characters with `----`.

All other lines remain the same.
