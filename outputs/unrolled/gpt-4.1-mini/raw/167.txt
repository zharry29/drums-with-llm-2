The original groove has kicks with some syncopation, crash cymbals on every first beat, a closed hi-hat pattern, and a tom hit on beat 3 of bar 3. The snare line includes a single ambiguous character 'S' (which is not defined in the original notation). Since 'S' does not match the known snare articulations (O, o, X, x), it needs correction.

The request says the groove should have not only kick but also snare, so the snare presence should be clear and fit the notation.

**Thought process:**  
- Replace the unknown 'S' character with a proper snare hit.  
- Place hard snare hits on typical snare backbeat positions â€“ beats 2 and 4. Right now, snare is only attempted on beat 1 of bar 3 (which is unusual).  
- Adding snare hits on beats 2 and 4 will enhance groove.  
- Keep the kick and cymbal pattern as is to preserve the groove feel.  
- Leave toms and hi-hat as is.
