The original groove has kick and snare hits, but no toms or ride cymbal hits. The request is to add both tom and snare.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the existing snare hits.  
- Add tom hits (hard hits 'O') to fill spaces rhythmically and melodically.  
- Maintain the existing kick and hi-hat pattern (hi-hat is closed sidestick 'X').  
- No ride cymbal is present, but is not requested here.
