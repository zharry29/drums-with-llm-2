The original groove has kick, snare (soft sidesticks `X`), hi-hat, and ride cymbal closed hits. The request is that the groove should have not only snare but also cymbal. Since cymbal is present as the ride line, I should strengthen the snare presence beyond just sidesticks.

**Thought process:**  
- Add hard snare hits (`O`) on backbeats 2 and 4 while keeping sidesticks as ghost notes for texture.  
- Maintain kick, hi-hat, and ride as is.
