The request is to reduce the number of notes, making the groove simpler.

Looking at the groove:

- Hi-hat (H) has soft closed hits on beats 2 and 4 (positions 6 and 14).
- Ride (R) has closed hits on positions 1,5,6,8,9,13,14,16.
- No other instruments have hits.

To simplify:

- Remove one hi-hat hit (for example, the one at beat 4).
- Remove some ride hits to make the pattern less busy (for example, keep only hits on beats 1 and 3).

Here's the simplified version:
