Let's analyze the original hihat pattern:

```
H: ----|x---|----|x---
```

This means only two soft closed hits, on the 1st 16th of beat 2 and beat 4.

---

### Request:

Make the hi-hat pattern more varied.

---

### Ideas to add variety:

- Add 16th note subdivisions to create a more driving, syncopated feel.

- Use a mix of soft closed (`x`) and soft open (`o`) to create texture.

- Add hits on 2nd and 4th 16th notes of each beat or intersperse some muted/rests for groove.

---

### Implementation:

- Beat 1: add two 16th note hits on 1st and 3rd 16th notes → `x-x-`

- Beat 2: keep first hit but add a soft open hi-hat on 3rd 16th note → `x-o-`

- Beat 3: add two 16th hits on 2nd and 4th notes → `-x-x`

- Beat 4: keep original hit but add a soft open hi-hat on 3rd 16th note → `x-o-`

---

### New Hi-hat line:

```
H: x-x-|x-o-|-x-x|x-o-
```

---

### Final groove:
