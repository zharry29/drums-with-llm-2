To add more low frequency sounds, I will increase the kick drum presence and optionally add toms. Currently, the kick hits are on beats 1 and 3; adding some more kick hits on off-beats or additional 16th notes would add weight. Also, toms are silent, so adding tom hits can contribute low-mid frequencies.

Here's my plan:

- Add extra kick hits on the "and" of beat 2 and beat 4 (6th and 14th 16th notes).

- Add tom hits on the "e" (2nd 16th) of beat 3 and "a" (4th 16th) of beat 4.

Keep snare and hi-hat as is.
