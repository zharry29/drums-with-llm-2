To add more low frequency sounds, the best option is to reinforce or add more kick drum hits since they occupy the low frequency range. The current kick hits are on beats 1, 2, and 4, which is decent but sporadic.

Also, the toms are played softly with `O-o-` pattern each beat, which already adds some low-mids, but maybe more hard hits on toms could beef up the low frequency feel.

---

**Plan:**

- Add more kick hits to fill in gaps with more 16th note kick hits especially around beats 3 and 4.

- Strengthen tom hits by changing some soft hits to hard hits (`O`) in the pattern.

---

**Implementation:**

- Kicks: Add an extra kick on the "and" of beat 3 (the 14th 16th note).

- Toms: Change the soft hits (`o`) on the second and fourth 16th notes of each beat to hard hits (`O`) to add power.
