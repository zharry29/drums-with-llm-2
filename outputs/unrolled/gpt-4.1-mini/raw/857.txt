The original groove:

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a kick hit and tom in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Kick (K) at the very beginning (first 16th note) is '-', so add a hard kick hit 'O' there.
- Tom (T) at the very beginning is '-', so add a hard tom hit 'O' there.
- Other lines remain unchanged.

Final groove:

K: O-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: O---|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

(Note: The first bar shows one extra character because fixing indexing, the original K line looks like it has 4 characters per beat, so total 16 characters - I added an 'O' without displacing others, so adjusting the first beat to 5 characters is invalid. Correct is to keep 16 characters total.)

Correcting carefully:  
Original K first beat: `-O--` (4 characters) — add 'O' at first position: `O O--`. So `O--O` would displace original characters. Instead, replace the first '-' by 'O', the rest remains. So first beat becomes `O O--` (which is `O O--`). But two spaces? Actually, we have 4 characters per beat.

So original first beat is `- O - -`  
Positions: 1 2 3 4  
We add an 'O' at position 1, so `O O - -` is 5 chars, invalid. So only replace the first '-' with 'O', then keep rest:  
`O O - -` → no, 'O' at pos 1, 'O' at pos 2? There is 'O' at position 2 already. So final first beat: `O O - -` is 4 chars: replaced `- O - -` with `O O - -`.

Thus, first beat K: `O O - -`.

Similarly for T at first position '-' replaced by 'O' → `O---`.

The final corrected groove is:
