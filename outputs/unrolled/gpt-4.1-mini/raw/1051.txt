The original ride cymbal line is completely silent:

```
R: ----|----|----|----
```

The request is to keep the **same placement of ride** but be **more dynamic**.

Since there are no ride cymbal hits currently, keeping the same placement means the ride remains silent.

No ride hits can be added without changing placement.
