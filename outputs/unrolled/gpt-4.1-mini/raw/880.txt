Let's look at the snare hits and check if any are on downbeats 2 or 4.

The bar has 16 sixteenth notes, grouped in four beats of 4 notes each.

- Downbeat 2 is the 5th sixteenth note (first character after the first "|").
- Downbeat 4 is the 13th sixteenth note (first character after the third "|").

Snare line:

```
S: ----|----|O---|----
```

Positions:

- Downbeat 2 (5th char): the first char of second group, snare is `-` (no hit).
- Downbeat 4 (13th char): first char of fourth group, snare is `-` (no hit).
  
The only snare hit is at the 9th character (first char of third group), which is **not** a downbeat 2 or 4.

Therefore, no snare hits on downbeats 2 and 4 exist, so no changes are needed.
