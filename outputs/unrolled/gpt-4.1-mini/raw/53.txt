The original groove has:   
- Kick drum playing on almost every 16th note except some missing hits.  
- Snare on beats 2 and 4 downbeats.  
- Crash cymbal on every beat downbeat.  
- No hi-hat so far.

---

**Request:** Add some hi-hat to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**  
- To complement the busy kick and steady crash, adding hi-hat with soft closed hits (`x`) on every 8th note (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15) will give rhythmic drive and flow.  
- This keeps it simple, solid, and supports the groove without clutter.

Hi-hat pattern:  
Positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15: x  
Others: -
