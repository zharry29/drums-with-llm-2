The original groove includes kick, hi-hat, toms, and crash, but no ride and snare is indicated with an unknown "S". The edit requests that the groove should have not only ride but also snare. So I need to:

- Convert the unknown "S" to a proper snare note, probably a soft open snare head hit (`o`) or a hard snare hit (`O`) based on context.
- Add ride cymbal pattern (e.g., closed hits `x` on steady 8th notes).
- Maintain the existing instruments as much as possible.

**Thought process:**

- Replace the "S" on the snare line with `o` (soft open hit) to provide snare presence.
- Add ride cymbal closed hits on steady 8th notes (`x-x-`) for drive.
- Keep other parts unchanged.
