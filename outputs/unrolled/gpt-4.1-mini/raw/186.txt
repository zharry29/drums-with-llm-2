The original groove features kick and snare patterns with ride cymbal hits marked as soft and hard open bell hits (`o-O-` pattern), but no tom hits currently.

The request is to add toms in addition to the ride.

**Thought process:**  
- Add some tom hits (`O` for hard hits) to enhance the groove without cluttering it.  
- Place tom hits where they fill space rhythmically, such as towards the 3rd beat or slightly before, complementing kick and snare.  
- Keep the ride pattern as is.
