The original groove:

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a ride hit and tom in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Very beginning means first 16th note.
- Ride cymbal (R) first character is "-", so we need to add a ride hit at the start.
- For a ride hit, I'll add a hard closed ride hit "X" on the bow.
- Tom (T) first character is "-", so add a tom hit here. Since tom hits vary in articulation, add a hard hit "O" at the first character.
- Kick (K) and other parts remain unchanged.
