The original groove already features hi-hat with a repeating pattern of hard closed (X) and soft closed (x) hits:  
`X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-`

The edit request is to add some hi-hat, but since hi-hat is already present with a busy pattern, we can enhance it by adding some open hi-hat hits for more texture.

---

**Thought process:**  
- I'll add soft open hi-hat hits ('o') on the "and" of each beat (positions 3, 7, 11, 15) to complement the existing pattern.  
- This will enrich the hi-hat sound with occasional openness, keeping it dynamic and interesting.

Resulting hi-hat pattern per beat (positions 1-4):  
`X-o-`  

Repeated throughout the bar.
