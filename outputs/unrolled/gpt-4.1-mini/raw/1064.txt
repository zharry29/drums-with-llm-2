Let's analyze the original Snare (S) line:

```
S: ----|O---|----|O---
```

There are two main snare hits, both hard hits `O` at the 1st 16th note of beats 2 and 4.

---

**Request:** Add ghost notes on the snare.

- Ghost notes are soft hits, denoted by `o`.

- Place ghost notes between main hits to add subtle rhythmic detail without changing main hit placement.

---

### Plan:

- Insert some soft snare hits (`o`) at off-beats (e.g., 2nd or 3rd 16th note positions in the beats where snare is silent).

- For example:

  - Beat 2: main hit on 1st 16th (`O---`), add ghost on 3rd 16th note (`--o-`), resulting in `O-o-` (preserving main hit leftmost).

  - Beat 4: similarly add a ghost note on 2nd 16th note (`-o--`), so `Oo--`.

---

### Revised Snare line:

```
S: ----|O-o-|----|Oo--
```
