The request is to remove kick hits on beat 4 while leaving everything else unchanged.

Looking at the Kick line (K) on beat 4 (positions 13-16):

- Beat 4: `-OOO` â†’ Here, the first 16th note of beat 4 is `-` (no hit), and the remaining three 16th notes are hard hits `O O O`.

To remove the kick hits on beat 4, replace `-OOO` with `----`.

All other lines remain unchanged.
