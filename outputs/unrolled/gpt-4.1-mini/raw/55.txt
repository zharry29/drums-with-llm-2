The original groove has:  
- Kick hits on beats 1 and 3 downbeats.  
- Snare hits on beats 2 and 4 downbeats.  
- Hi-hat closed hits on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4 downbeats.  
- No cymbal currently.

---

**Request:** Add cymbal to the groove (in addition to kick).

---

**Thought process:**  
- Adding crash cymbal hits on the downbeats of beats 1 and 3 (positions 1 and 9) will complement the kick and add dynamic punctuation.  
- Using hard crash hits `O` at those positions.

Final cymbal line:  
`O---|----|O---|----`
