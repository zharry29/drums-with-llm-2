The original groove already includes both kick and hi-hat:  
- Kick hits on beat 1 of bars 1 and 3 (positions 1 and 9).  
- Hi-hat hard closed hits on beat 1 of each bar (positions 1, 5, 9, 13).  

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only hi-hat but also kick.  

---

**Thought process:**  
- Kick is present but somewhat sparse. To emphasize kick presence, I will add a couple of extra kick hits on a couple of off beats to give it a fuller feel.  
- Keep hi-hat pattern consistent and steady with hard closed hits.
