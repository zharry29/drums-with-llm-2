Let's analyze the original groove:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

There are no snare hits currently (`S:` line is all dashes).

---

**Request:** Add some ghost notes on the snare.

- Ghost notes on snare are soft snare hits, represented as `o`.

- Since currently there are no snare hits, we will add subtle ghost notes at off-beat 16th note positions, without disturbing the groove or the existing hits.

---

### Plan:

- Place ghost notes on snare at soft 16th notes, such as the "e" and "a" subdivisions (2nd and 4th 16th notes of the beat).

- For example, add ghost notes at the 2nd 16th note of beat 2 and 4 of the bar.

---

### Implementation:

- Beat 2 (positions 5–8): add soft ghost note on 2nd 16th → pattern: `-o--`

- Beat 4 (positions 13–16): add soft ghost note on 2nd 16th → pattern: `-o--`

---

### New snare line:

```
S: ----|-o--|----|-o--
```
