The original groove:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I don't want any cymbal or snare."

- Snare (S) line contains hard hits 'O'; replace with dashes.
- Cymbals include Crash (C) and Ride (R).
- Crash (C) and Ride (R) lines are empty; no changes.
- Hihat (H) remains unchanged; it is not a cymbal in this context (usually it is, but the request separates cymbals from others). However, the request states "any cymbal," so if strictly cymbals include Hihat, then Hihat should also be removed.

In the given context, cymbals are Crash and Ride, but often Hi-hat is also considered a cymbal. To be safe, let's remove all cymbals including Hihat.

- Remove Hihat hits as well.
