Let's analyze the current groove first:

- Kick drum: hits at 1, 4, 11  
- Snare: active and dynamic voice with mixture of hits and ghost notes  
- Hihat: consistent closed pattern  
- No cymbals currently  

---

Request: Add some cymbal to the groove.

---

Thought process:  

- Crash or ride cymbal would work here.

- The ride could complement the groove consistently with some bell hits on offbeats.

- Alternatively, a crash could emphasize the start of the bar.

- I'll add crash cymbals on the downbeats: positions 1 and 9 (start of beats 1 and 3).

- Add subtle ride bell hits on the "and" of beats 2 and 4 (positions 7 and 15) with hard bell hits (O).
