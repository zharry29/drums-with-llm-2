The original groove currently has:  
- Kick on beats 1 and 2 downbeats, and beat 4 downbeat.  
- Snare on beat 3 downbeat.  
- Toms playing a repeating pattern with alternating hard and soft hits.  
- No hi-hat, crash, or ride.

---

**Request:** Add some hi-hat to the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- To complement the existing groove, I'll add hi-hat with soft closed hits ('x') on every eighth note, i.e., positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 in the bar, to add a steady pulse alongside the toms and kick.  
- This will add rhythmic drive and texture without overpowering the groove.  
- Since no open hi-hat is requested, I'll keep all hi-hat hits soft closed (x).

Hi-hat pattern:  
`x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-`
