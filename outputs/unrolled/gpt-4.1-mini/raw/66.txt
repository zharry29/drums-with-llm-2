The current groove includes:  
- Kick drum (`K`) on beats 1 and 3.  
- Snare hits on beat 2 and 4 downbeats.  
- Hi-hat with hard closed hits (`X`) on the downbeat of each beat (positions 1,5,9,13).  
- No ride cymbal hits at all.

---

**Request:** The groove should have **not only ride but also hi-hat**.  
Right now, there is hi-hat but **no ride cymbal**.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the kick, snare, and hi-hat parts as they are since they fit well.  
- Add ride cymbal (`R`) to the groove.  
- Add ride closed hits (`x`) on the offbeats (positions 3,7,11,15) to complement the hi-hat. This adds subtle ride presence without clashing.

Final ride cymbal line:  
`--x-|--x-|--x-|--x-`
