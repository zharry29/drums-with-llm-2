The original cymbal lines are:

```
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

There are no crash or ride cymbal hits at all.

The request is to keep the same placement of cymbal hits but more dynamic.

Since there are no cymbal hits originally, the "same placement" means no cymbal hits, so we should keep them as is (silent).

Thus, I will leave the cymbal lines unchanged.
