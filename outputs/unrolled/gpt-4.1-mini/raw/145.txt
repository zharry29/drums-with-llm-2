The original groove has kick, hihat, tom, and crash, but the snare line has an invalid 'S' character. The edit request is to ensure the groove has both hi-hat and snare.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Replace the invalid 'S' with a proper snare hit 'O' on the third beat of the third beat group.  
- Possibly add a snare hit on the backbeat (beat 4) for better groove flow, but since the user only requested snare presence, fixing the invalid character should suffice.  
- Keep hihat and other parts unchanged.
