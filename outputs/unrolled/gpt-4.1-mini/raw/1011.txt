The original groove has no tom hits:

```
T: ----|----|----|----
```

The edit request is to keep the same placement of tom, but make it more dynamic.

Since there are currently *no* tom hits, the "same placement" means no tom hits.

So the tom line remains silent.

No other changes requested or needed.
