The original groove has:

- Kick on 1, the "and" of 1, and the "e" of 3
- Snare with some ghost notes and open hits adding texture
- No hihat
- No tom
- Ride cymbal pattern with soft and hard open bell hits on the bow rhythmically repeating

To add toms in a way that complements, I'll add some tom hits on the offbeats around beats 2 and 4 to fill the space, but not clutter it. 

Idea:

- Add soft toms 'o' on the last 16th note ("a") of beat 2 and beat 4, which correspond to positions 8 and 16 in the bar

- Add a hard tom 'O' on the "e" (2nd 16th note) of beat 3 (position 10), to fill the mid section

Position map (1-16):

- Beat 1: 1-4

- Beat 2: 5-8

- Beat 3: 9-12

- Beat 4: 13-16

Toms (T):

Positions 8 and 16: 'o' (soft hit)

Position 10: 'O' (hard hit)

All others are '-'

T: ----|---o|--O-|---o
