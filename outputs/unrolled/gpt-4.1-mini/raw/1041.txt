The original snare line is:

```
S: ----|O---|----|O---
```

Snare hits occur on:

- Bar 2, first 16th note (hard hit `O`)  
- Bar 4, first 16th note (hard hit `O`)

To keep the same snare placement but add more dynamics, I can:

- Add ghost hits (soft hits `o` or sidestick hits `X`/`x`) around the main snare hits without changing their timing.  
- Vary the articulation (e.g., introduce soft open hits `o` or soft sidesticks `x`) near the main hits to enrich the texture.

Proposed edits:

- Bar 2:
  - Main snare hit remains on 1st 16th note as hard hit `O`  
  - Add a soft sidestick (`x`) on the 3rd 16th note to add dynamics within the same beat

- Bar 4:
  - Main snare hit remains on 1st 16th note as hard hit `O`  
  - Add a soft sidestick (`x`) on the 3rd 16th note for balance

Revised snare line:

```
S: ----|O--x|----|O--x
```
