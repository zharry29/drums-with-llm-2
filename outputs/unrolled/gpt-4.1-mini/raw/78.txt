The current groove includes:  
- Kick drum with dense hits in the first and third bars.  
- Snare hits on beats 6 and 14 (2nd and 4th bar downbeats).  
- Crash cymbal on every downbeat (positions 1, 5, 9, 13).  
- No hi-hat.  
- No ride cymbal.

---

**Request:** Groove should have **not only cymbal but also ride**.  
Currently, there is crash cymbal but no ride. We need to add ride cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add ride cymbal closed soft hits (`x`) on downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13) to complement the crash cymbal pattern.  
- Add hi-hat closed soft hits (`x`) on the offbeats (positions 3,7,11,15) for rhythmic contrast and fullness.  
- Keep all other parts unchanged.
