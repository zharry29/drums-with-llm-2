The original groove already includes both toms and kicks:

- Kicks: `O---|O---|----|O---`
- Toms: `O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`

---

**Request:** Ensure the groove includes not only tom but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**

- Since both are present and the kick pattern is a bit sparse (only on the first 16th note of beats 1, 2, and 4), I will add a couple more kick hits to increase presence, while keeping the tom pattern intact.
