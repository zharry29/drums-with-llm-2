The "a" of the second beat corresponds to the 4th 16th note of beat 2. Counting the 16th notes starting from 0, beat 2 covers indices 4 to 7:
- 4 = 1
- 5 = e
- 6 = &
- 7 = a

I need to add a cymbal hit on index 7 in the second beat.

The cymbal parts currently are:  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

Since the crash cymbal (C) line is empty and the ride cymbal (R) has hits already, I will add a hard crash cymbal hit 'O' on position 7 of beat 2, i.e., the second quartet segment in the C line goes from `----` to `---O`.
