The original groove already has toms playing a repeated pattern of alternating hard and soft hits on every beat (O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-).

The request is to add some tom to the groove, but since toms are already present in a steady pattern throughout the bar, I can enhance the tom part slightly to add more variation or accents.

Options:
- Add some extra tom hits on the 16th notes that are currently silent within the tom line.
- Add a stronger accent (hard hits O) on some offbeat 16ths.
- Vary the softness of the tom hits for dynamics.

Currently, the tom line is:  
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

Positions (1-4 each beat):

Beat 1: O - o - -  
Beat 2: O - o - -  
Beat 3: O - o - -  
Beat 4: O - o - -

(Note: The original line is "O-o-", which means: 1st 16th (O), 2nd 16th ( - ), 3rd (o), 4th (-). So tom hits on 1 and 3 for each beat.)

To add more tom flavor, I can add tom hits in the off-16th notes currently silent (2nd and 4th 16th of each beat). For subtlety, let's add soft tom hits 'o' on those silences.

Resulting tom line:  
T: Oo-o|Oo-o|Oo-o|Oo-o

Which is: hit on 1 (O), hit on 2 (o), hit on 3 (o), hit on 4 (-)

Alternatively, I could do:

T: OoOo|OoOo|OoOo|OoOo

Adding tom hits on all 4 16th notes (with alternating hard and soft).

But this might be too busy.

Better to add soft tom hits on the 2nd 16th of each beat, keeping the 4th 16th silent for space.

Hence: Oo-o|Oo-o|Oo-o|Oo-o

Now, let's write the complete groove with this tom pattern.
