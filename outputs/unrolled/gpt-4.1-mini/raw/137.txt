The original groove includes kick, snare, and toms, but no hi-hat.

---

**Request:** Add not only tom but also hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kick, snare, and tom parts unchanged to preserve the core groove.  
- Add a basic closed hi-hat pattern, typically steady eighth notes (soft closed hi-hat hits 'x').  
- Keep the rest unchanged.
