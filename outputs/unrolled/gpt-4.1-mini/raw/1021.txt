The original hihat pattern is:

```
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
```

This means in each beat, there are hits on:  
- Beat 1: 3rd 16th (soft open `o`)  
- Beat 2: 1st (hard open `O`), 3rd (soft open `o`)  
- Beat 3: 1st (hard open `O`), 3rd (soft open `o`)  
- Beat 4: 1st (hard open `O`), 3rd (soft open `o`)

To keep the same placement but make it more dynamic, I can introduce more varied articulation (mixing hard and soft hits) and possibly add ghost hits or slight variations on velocity/articulation at the same note positions.

Ideas for more dynamics:  
- Alternate between hard open `O` and hard closed `X` on the downbeats (1st 16th note of beats 2-4)  
- Add a soft closed `x` 16th note after the open hits for subtle variation, but only where it won't change placement in overall sense (i.e., only additional hits adjacent or on existing positions)  
- Alternate between soft open and soft closed hits on the off-beats (3rd 16th notes) of beats.

Proposed edited hihat line:

Beat 1: keep `--o-` (soft open on 3rd 16th note)

Beat 2: change `O-o-` to `X-x-`  
(1st = hard closed `X`, 3rd = soft closed `x`)

Beat 3: change `O-o-` to `O-o-` (keep as is)

Beat 4: change `O-o-` to `X-x-`

So full hihat line:

```
H: --o-|X-x-|O-o-|X-x-
```

This increases dynamic contrasts by alternating open and closed hihat hits with mixed articulation while keeping placement the same.
