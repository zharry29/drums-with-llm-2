To reshape this groove into a metal style, hereâ€™s my approach:

- Kick: Make it a constant, aggressive 16th note pattern using hard hits (`O`), typical of metal double-kick or blast beats.

- Snare: Keep hard hits (`O`) on beats 2 and 4, adding ghost notes (`o`) just before the main hits for groove and aggression.

- Hi-hat: Add steady hard closed 16th notes (`X`) to drive the rhythm. Hi-hat was silent in the original, so this adds much-needed momentum.

- Ride: Remove soft open ride hits (`o-O-`) to simplify and focus on hi-hat and kick/snare. Ride patterns are less common in aggressive metal grooves.

- Toms and Crash: Remain silent.
