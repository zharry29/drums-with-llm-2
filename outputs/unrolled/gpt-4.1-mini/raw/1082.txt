The original hi-hat pattern is quite sparse:

```
H: ----|x---|----|x---
```

Only soft closed hits on the 1st 16th note of beats 2 and 4.

---

### Edit request:

Make the hi-hat pattern more varied.

---

### Thought process:

- Add more 16th note hits for rhythmic interest.

- Use a combination of soft closed (`x`) and soft open (`o`) hits to add texture.

- Create some syncopation using rests.

---

### Implementation plan:

- Beat 1: `x-o-` (soft closed, rest, soft open, rest)

- Beat 2: `x-xo` (soft closed, soft closed, soft open, rest)

- Beat 3: `-x-o` (rest, soft closed, rest, soft open)

- Beat 4: `x--o` (soft closed, rest, rest, soft open)

---

### Final hi-hat line:

```
H: x-o-|x-xo|-x-o|x--o
```

---

### Final groove:
