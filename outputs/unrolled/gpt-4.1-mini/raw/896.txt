Let's analyze the original groove for note count:

- Kick (K):
  - Beat 1: O on 1st sixteenth note (1 note)
  - Beat 3: O on 1st sixteenth note (1 note)
- Snare (S):
  - Beat 2: O on 1st sixteenth note (1 note)
  - Beat 4: O on 1st sixteenth note (1 note)
- Hi-hat (H):
  - Beat 1: X on 1st sixteenth note (1 note)
  - Beat 2: X on 1st sixteenth note (1 note)
  - Beat 3: X on 1st sixteenth note (1 note)
  - Beat 4: X on 1st sixteenth note (1 note)

Total = 2 (kick) + 2 (snare) + 4 (hi-hat) = 8 notes

The original groove already has exactly 8 notes, meeting the request perfectly.

Therefore, no edits are necessary.
