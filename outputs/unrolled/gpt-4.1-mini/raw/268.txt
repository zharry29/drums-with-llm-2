The original groove has only cymbal (ride) and a sparse hi-hat pattern with two closed hi-hat hits (`x`) on beats 2 and 4. The request is for the groove to have not only cymbal but also hi-hat, so I should enhance the hi-hat presence.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add more steady closed hi-hat hits (`x`), for example on every 8th note or every offbeat 16th note to fill the hi-hat part.  
- Keep ride pattern unchanged to maintain presence of cymbal.  
- Keep no kicks or snare as per original.
