The original groove already contains hi-hat (`H`) and ride cymbal (`R`) parts, as well as kick and snare. The request is that the groove should have not only hi-hat but also ride, so since ride is already present, no removal is required. The ride has a pattern of closed and partially open hits (`x` and `X-x-`). The current hi-hat pattern is more sparse with closed hits on off beats.

To better emphasize both hi-hat and ride cymbal, I will keep the ride the same and slightly adjust the hi-hat to have a more solid presence by adding some steady 8th notes (closed hits) without overpowering the ride. This enhances the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the kick and snare as is.  
- Slightly increase hi-hat presence to steady eighth notes with soft closed hits (`x`).  
- Keep the ride pattern unchanged for consistency.
