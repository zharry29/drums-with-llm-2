The original groove contains kick, snare, and ride cymbal, so it already has both snare and ride. The request is to have not only snare but also ride, so we should keep both present. The kick is already included in the groove, which gives a solid base.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the current kick pattern as it is.  
- Keep the snare articulation as is, an interesting combination of open and soft hits.  
- Keep the ride cymbal pattern intact, which is a soft and hard open bell hit pattern.  
- No other additions required.
