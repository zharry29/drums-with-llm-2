The original groove has a strong kick pattern (“O” hard hits), snare hits on beats 2 and 4, crash cymbals on downbeats, but no toms.

Request: groove should include toms as well as kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits to complement the kick pattern and fill some space without overcrowding.  
- Place tom hit(s) on some offbeats or 16th notes near kicks for rhythmic interest.  
- Keep existing kick, snare, and crash parts as they are.
