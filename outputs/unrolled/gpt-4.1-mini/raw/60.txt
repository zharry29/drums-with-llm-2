The current groove contains kick (K) and ride cymbal (R) already. However, the request is to have groove with not only kick but also cymbal, so adding a crash cymbal will fulfill this by introducing cymbal hits apart from ride.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Ride cymbal is softly playing on every beat (positions 1,5,9,13) with bell hits (soft `o` and hard `O` alternating).  
- No crash cymbal present.  
- Add crash cymbal on beats 1 and 3 downbeats (positions 1 and 9) using hard `O`.  
- This will emphasize the downbeats and add energy.

Final cymbal (C) line:  
`O---|----|O---|----`
