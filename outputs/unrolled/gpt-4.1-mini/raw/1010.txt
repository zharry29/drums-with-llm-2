Request:  
- Keep the same tom placement,  
- But make the tom hits more dynamic.

Original tom pattern:  
`O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`  
Meaning: each beat is 4 sixteenth notes, with tom hit on 1st (hard, O), 2nd (soft, o), 3rd (hard, O), 4th (soft, o).  

To add more dynamics, I can vary the articulation between hard and soft hits more expressively while keeping the hits in the same sixteenth note positions. For example, I could make some hits accented (hard) and others softer, with some "grace note" feel by alternating the softness/hardness distinctly.  

One possibility: Use a pattern like `O-oO|o-O-|Oo-o|oO-o` or `O-Oo|o-O-|O-oO|oO-o`

However, to keep it clear and balanced, I will alternate more definite hard and soft hits, e.g.:  

`O-Oo|oOo-|O-oO|oO-o`  

This keeps placement at same sixteenth note spots, but adds more variation and dynamic feel.

All other instruments remain unchanged.
