The original groove has kick drum hits (`K: O--O|----|--O-|----`) already placed but no tom hits (`T:` line is empty).

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only tom but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Kick is already present, so keep it as is.  
- Add tom hits to create an interesting rhythm; Iâ€™ll add a soft tom hit on the offbeat in the 2nd bar (position 7) and a hard tom on the downbeat of the 4th bar (position 13) to complement the groove.  
- Leave other parts unchanged.
