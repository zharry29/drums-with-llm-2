The original groove has kick (soft hits), snare sidestick (`X`/`X`), hi-hat closed hits, and ride cymbal closed hits, but the snare hits are just sidesticks and quite sparse. The request is that the groove should have not only ride but also snare. To emphasize the snare, I will add some hard snare hits (`O`) on the backbeats while keeping sidesticks as ghost notes for texture.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kicks mostly as soft hits `o`.  
- Add hard snare hits `O` on beats 2 and 4 (standard backbeat).  
- Keep sidesticks (`X`) as ghost notes around main snare hits.  
- Keep hi-hat and ride pattern unchanged.
