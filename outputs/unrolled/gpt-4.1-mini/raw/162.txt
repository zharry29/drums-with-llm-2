The original groove already has snare hits on beat 2 and 4 (line S: 'O---' and 'O---') and kicks on beat 1 and 3 (line K: 'O---'). The request says the groove should have not only kick but also snare, which is currently satisfied.

To better fulfill the request, I will enhance the snare presence by adding a few more snare hits to give it a stronger role alongside the kick.

**Thought process:**

- Keep the existing kick hits as is.
- Add some additional snare hits, possibly some softer or sidestick hits to fill in the groove.
- Keep hi-hat as is for simplicity.
- No other instruments affected.
