The original groove:

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a hihat hit and tom in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Hihat (H) at first character is 'x', which is already a soft closed hit, so a hihat hit is present at the very beginning.
- Tom (T) first character is '-', add a hard tom hit 'O' at the first 16th note.
- Other parts remain unchanged.

Final groove:
