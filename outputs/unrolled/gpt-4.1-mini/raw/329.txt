The request is to remove ride and snare hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The groove has `S` on the Snare line (which is not standard notation, but presumably a snare hit), so I will replace it with `-` to remove it.  
- The Ride line is empty already, so no changes needed there.  
- Keep the kick, hi-hat, toms, and crash cymbals as is.
