The original groove features kick, snare, and hi-hat, but no ride cymbal. The edit request asks for a groove that has both hi-hat and ride. So I will keep the existing kick, snare, and hi-hat patterns and add a ride cymbal pattern.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kick and snare as is.  
- Keep closed hi-hat pattern intact (`X-x-`).  
- Add ride cymbal closed hits (`x`) on every 8th note (every 2 sixteenth notes) to complement the groove.
