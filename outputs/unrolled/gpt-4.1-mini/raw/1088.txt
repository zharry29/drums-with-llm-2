To transform this groove into a metal groove, here are the typical metal drumming features to introduce:

- Kick drum: faster, often continuous or at least driving 16th note kick pattern (including double kicks).

- Snare: strong hard hits on 2 and 4, possibly with ghost notes.

- Hi-hat: steady 16th note hits, preferably hard closed (`X`), often with slight accents.

- Ride/crash: keep minimal or add crash accents on first beat optionally.

Looking at the original groove:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

- Kick is sparse (only beat 1 of bars 1 and 3).

- Snare hits on beat 1 of bars 2 and 4 (which is unusual for the snare backbeat).

- Hi-hat is steady but only on beat 1 of each bar, no 16th notes.

---

### What to change?

- Kick: add steady 16th / double kick pattern.

- Snare: hard hits on 2 and 4 with ghost notes for groove.

- Hi-hat: constant 16th note pattern with `X`.

---

### Revised groove plan:

**Kick:** steady 16th notes on beats 1 and 2 (first half of bar), then 8th notes on beats 3 and 4 with accents.

**Snare:** hard hits on 2 and 4, ghost notes on the 16th before the snare.

**Hi-hat:** constant 16th note hard closed hits `X`.

### Notation proposal (16 characters per line without spaces):

- Kick:

```
O-O-|O-O-|--O-|O---
```

- Snare:

Ghost notes (`o`) on 16th before snare (`O`) on beats 2 and 4:

```
--oO|--oO|----|--oO
```

- Hi-hat:

Constant `X` 16th:

```
XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX
```
