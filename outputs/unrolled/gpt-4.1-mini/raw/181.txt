The original groove features kicks, closed hi-hats, tom hits in bar 3, and crash cymbals every bar. The snare line contains an invalid character 'S' which is not defined in the notation.

The edit request asks for both ride and toms. The groove currently has toms but no ride cymbal hits.

**Thought process:**  
- Replace invalid 'S' on snare line with a valid snare articulation (e.g., hard snare hit 'O').  
- Add ride cymbal hits (closed 'x' or hard closed 'X' on the bow, or bell hits 'O/o') to give ride presence.  
- Keep tom and crash cymbals as they are.  
- Maintain kick and hi-hat patterns.
