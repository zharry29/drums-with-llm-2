The original Snare (S) line is:

```
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
```

Breaking down each beat for snare hits:

- Beat 1: no hits

- Beat 2: hard open hit (`O`) on 1st 16th, soft open hit (`o`) on 2nd, hard open hit (`-` indicates none) on 3rd, soft open hit (`o`) on 4th → `Oo-o`

- Beat 3: soft open hit only on 2nd 16th (`-o--`)

- Beat 4: hard open hit on 1st 16th (`O`) plus soft open hit on 4th 16th (`o`) → `O--o`

---

**Request:** Add ghost notes on snare to increase subtle rhythmic texture.

Ghost notes = soft hits `o` that are played quietly on snare.

---

### Thought process for adding ghost notes:

- Beat 1 is silent on snare; add some ghost note(s) on offbeat 16th notes.

- Beat 3 has one ghost note on 2nd 16th; add one more ghost note on 4th 16th such that it's `-o-o` instead of `-o--`.

- Beat 4 has hits on the 1st and 4th 16th; maybe add a soft ghost note on the 3rd 16th for subtlety.

---

### Resulting snare line:

- Beat 1: add ghost note on 3rd 16th → `--o-`

- Beat 2: keep as is → `Oo-o`

- Beat 3: add ghost note on 4th 16th → `-o-o`

- Beat 4: add ghost note on 3rd 16th → `O-o-`

---

### Final Snare (S) line:

```
S: --o-|Oo-o|-o-o|O-o-
```
