The original groove has kick, snare, and hi-hat but no tom or cymbals. The request is to add both tom and cymbal hits.

---

**Thought process:**
- Add tom hits (hard hits 'O') in spots that complement the groove without overcrowding.
- Add crash cymbal hits on the first beat of the bar and possibly others to add cymbal presence.
- Keep the kick, snare, and hi-hat as is to maintain the grooveâ€™s feel.
