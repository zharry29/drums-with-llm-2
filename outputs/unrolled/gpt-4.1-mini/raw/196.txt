The original groove has kicks, soft and open snare hits, and ride cymbal open bell hits, but no toms. The request is to add both tom and snare.

Since snare is already present (soft and open hits), I will strengthen the snare presence by adding some additional hard snare hits on key beats. Then, I will add tom hits (hard hits 'O') to fill some space and complement the groove without overwhelming it.

**Thought process:**  
- Add hard snare hits on the backbeat (beat 2 and 4) and some ghost notes for groove.  
- Add tom hits on offbeats to complement the rhythm.  
- Keep kick and ride parts mostly unchanged.
