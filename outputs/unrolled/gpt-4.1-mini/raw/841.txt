The original groove:

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

Request: "I'd like a kick hit and cymbal in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Kick (K) at the very beginning (first 16th note) is 'o' (soft hit), so we can upgrade it to a hard kick hit 'O' to emphasize the kick hit.
- Cymbal: Crash (C) and Ride (R) are candidates for cymbal hits.
- Ride (R) has a soft closed hit 'x' at first position; to add a distinct cymbal hit, adding a Crash cymbal hard hit 'O' at the first 16th note would stand out.
- Other lines remain unchanged.
