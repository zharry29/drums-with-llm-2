The original groove includes kick, snare with some soft open hits, and ride bell cymbal hits. The ride cymbal is present, so there is cymbal already.

The request is the groove should have not only cymbal but also snare. Since snare is present but somewhat sparse, I'll add some more snare hits to complement the existing ones, making the snare more prominent while keeping the relaxed feel.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep existing kick and ride bell pattern.  
- Add some snare side stick hits (X) or soft hits (o) on the backbeat and inner beats to enhance snare presence.  
- Keep the groove loose and musical.

Since the snare is already present and not very light, this seems appropriate. If the request is strict about a stronger snare, below is a variant adding regular snare hits on beats 2 and 4:
