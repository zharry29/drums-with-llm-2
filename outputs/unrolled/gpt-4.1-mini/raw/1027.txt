The original hihat pattern is:

```
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
```

Each beat has hihat hits on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th 16th notes per group of 4, i.e., positions 1 and 3 within each beat, both soft closed hits (`x`).

To keep the identical placement but make it more dynamic, I will:

- Alternate between hard (`X`) and soft (`x`) closed strikes on the strong hits (i.e., make every other hit a hard hit).  
- Occasionally replace one of the hits with a hard open hihat hit (`O`) to add texture but at the same position.  
- Vary accents without changing timing.

Here is my plan for each beat (4 sixteenth notes each):

- Beat 1 (positions 1-4): `x-x-` → `X-Xo`  
  - 1st 16th: hard closed hit (X)  
  - 3rd 16th: hard closed hit (X)  
  - 4th 16th: soft open hit (o) for extra color  
- Beat 2: `x-x-` → `x-xO`  
  - soft closed (x), soft closed (x), and hard open (O) on last 16th  
- Beat 3: `x-x-` → `X-X-` (just accented hard hits)  
- Beat 4: `x-x-` → `x-xo` (soft closed with a soft open note at end)

Putting these together:

```
H: X-Xo|x-xO|X-X-|x-xo
```

This keeps all original hihat hits in place but increases dynamic variety by alternating articulations and adding open notes.
