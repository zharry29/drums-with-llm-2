The requested edit is to have the closed hi-hat played on all 16th notes throughout the bar, with accents on the quarter note downbeats.

Hi-hat notation:
- ‘X’ = hard closed hit (accent on quarter note downbeat)
- ‘x’ = soft closed hit (unaccented 16th notes)

Positions 1, 5, 9, and 13 are downbeats and get ‘X’. Other 16th notes get ‘x’.

Original hi-hat line:
```
X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
```
We will update it to:
```
Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx
```
to reflect all 16th notes played, with accents on downbeats.

No changes to other instruments.
