The request is to remove hi-hat and tom hits.

---

**Thought process:**

- Hi-hat line (H) contains closed hi-hat hits (`X` and `x`), so replace all with `-`.  
- Tom line (T) is already empty, so no changes needed there.  
- Keep kick and snare as is.  
- Crash and ride are empty, so no change there.
