The original groove has kick, snare, and hi-hat, but no cymbal beyond hi-hat. The request asks for the groove to have not only snare but also cymbal (crash or ride). Since there's no ride or crash, I will add ride cymbal hits to introduce a cymbal element.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kick, snare, and hi-hat unchanged.  
- Add ride cymbal (`x` for hard closed ride hits) on steady 8th notes to complement the hi-hat and provide cymbal texture.  
- Leave tom and crash empty.
