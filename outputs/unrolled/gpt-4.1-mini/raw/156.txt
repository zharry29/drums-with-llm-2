The original groove contains kick (K) on beats 1 and 3, snare (S) on beats 2 and 4, and closed hi-hat sidesticks (H) on every 1st 16th note of each beat. The request asks to make sure the groove has not only cymbal(s) but also kick, so kicks are already present but perhaps could be emphasized or better integrated.

**Thought process:**  
- The groove already has kicks, so I will maintain them.  
- Possibly add a couple more slight kicks to emphasize groove without crowding.  
- Keep snare and hi-hat mostly the same to preserve feel.  
- No other instruments added as not requested.
