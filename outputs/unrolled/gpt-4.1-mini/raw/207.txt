The original groove has kick, snare, and hi-hat parts, but no crash or ride cymbal hits. The request is to add cymbal to the groove while keeping the current hi-hat.

**Thought process:**  
- Add crash cymbal ('O') hits on the first beat of each bar to accent the start.  
- Optionally, add ride cymbal ('o' or 'O') for additional cymbal texture but since the instruction is just to add cymbal, I will add crash only here to keep it simple.  
- Keep kick, snare, hi-hat unchanged.
