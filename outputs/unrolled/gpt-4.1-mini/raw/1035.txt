The original ride cymbal line is:

```
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

- Beat 1: soft closed hit (x) on 1st 16th note  
- Beat 2: hard closed (X) on 1st, soft closed (x) on 3rd 16th notes  
- Beat 3: soft closed (x) on 1st 16th note  
- Beat 4: hard closed (X) on 1st, soft closed (x) on 3rd  

To make the same placement but more dynamic, I can:

- Introduce alternation between closed and open hits (add `O` or `o`) on the same 16th notes.  
- Accentuate by mixing hard and soft closed hits with occasional open hits at the same position.  
- Maybe introduce some interaction by adding a soft open hit immediately after one of the current hits within the 16th note groups, i.e., layering.

Proposed changes:

- Beat 1: `x---` → `Xo--` (hard closed + soft open hit on bell at 2nd 16th note)  
- Beat 2: `X-x-` → `XO-o` (hard closed, hard open, soft open)  
- Beat 3: `x---` → `Xo--`  
- Beat 4: `X-x-` → `XO-o`

This adds more dynamic range by layering hard and soft closed hits with hard and soft open hits.
