The request is to remove both snare and ride cymbal hits from the groove.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The snare line (S) contains various hits (`O`, `o`), so I will replace all with `-`.  
- The ride line (R) contains many hits (`o`, `O`), so I will also replace all ride hits with `-`.  
- Kick part (K) remains untouched as it is not requested to be removed.  
- Other lines are already empty.

Final groove:
