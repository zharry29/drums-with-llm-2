The original groove already features toms (with a repeated pattern of alternating hard and soft hits) and snare on the third beat. The request mentions having not only hi-hat but also tom, but this groove lacks hi-hat and contains toms. To fulfill the request more fully, I will add some hi-hat pattern while retaining the tom and snare.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add hi-hat closed soft hits (`x`) on the offbeats or 8th notes to complement the groove.  
- Keep tom and snare parts unchanged so the groove keeps its character.  
- Keep kick patterns intact.
