The original groove:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a hihat hit and snare in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning means the first 16th note.
- On the Snare (S) line, the first character is currently "-", so we need to add a snare hit. Let's add a soft open snare hit "o" (to keep it dynamic and not too overwhelming).
- On the Hihat (H) line, the first character is currently "-", so add a hard closed hihat hit "x" for a strong attack at the beginning.
- Other parts remain unchanged.

Final groove:
