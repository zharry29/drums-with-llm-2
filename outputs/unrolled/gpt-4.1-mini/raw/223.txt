The given groove includes kick, snare with soft and open hits, and closed hi-hat hits. No cymbal (crash or ride) is present.

The request is for both cymbal and snare, so since there is snare already, I will add cymbal hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add crash cymbal hits (hard hit ‘O’) on downbeats (1 and 3) for cymbal presence.  
- Preserve existing kick, snare, and hi-hat parts to keep groove vibe.  
- No ride cymbal changes necessary.
