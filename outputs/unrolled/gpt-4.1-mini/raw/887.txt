To make the beat feel less empty, I'll add:

- Harder kick hits on some downbeats and syncopated positions to give more groove.
- Snare hits on strong backbeats (2 and 4), replacing some soft sidesticks with hard hits to emphasize groove.
- More hi-hat closed hits on off-beats to fill texture.
- Keep the ride as is to maintain drive.

Here’s the plan:

- Kick: add `O` on 1st and 3rd beats (positions 1 and 9)
- Snare: replace soft sidesticks with hard hits on 6th and 14th sixteenth notes (X → O)
- Hi-hat: add more closed hits `x` on upbeat off-beats (positions 6 and 14)

Final groove:
