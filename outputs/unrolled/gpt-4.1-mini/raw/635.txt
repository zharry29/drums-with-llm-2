The original groove:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a kick hit and ride in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Kick drum (K) first character is "O" (hard hit), so kick is present.
- Ride cymbal (R) first character is "-", so add a ride hit.
- The notation for ride is: "O" for hard open bell, "o" for soft open bell, "X" for hard closed bow, "x" for soft closed bow.
- Considering a clear ride, let's add a hard closed bow hit "X" at the first 16th note.
- Other parts unchanged.
