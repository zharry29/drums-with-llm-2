Let's look at the current hihat pattern:

```
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
```

This is a steady pattern of closed hi-hat hits on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th 16th notes of each bar quarter.

---

### Request:

Make the hihat pattern more varied.

---

### Ideas:

- Add some open hi-hat hits (`o`) to add texture and dynamics.

- Introduce some rests or ghost hits to create syncopation.

- Mix hard and soft closed hits (`X` and `x`).

- Possibly place some hits on off-beat 16th notes for groove variety.

---

### Implementation:

- Beat 1: change `x-x-` to `xoxo` (soft closed, soft open, soft closed, soft open)

- Beat 2: change `x-x-` to `X--x` (hard closed on 1st 16th, rest, rest, soft closed)

- Beat 3: change `x-x-` to `oxox` (soft open, soft closed, soft open, soft closed)

- Beat 4: change `x-x-` to `x-o-` (soft closed, rest, soft open, rest)

---

### New hihat line:

```
H: xoxo|X--x|oxox|x-o-
```

### Final groove:
