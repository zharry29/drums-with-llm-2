The request is to remove cymbal and ride hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Cymbals include Crash (C), Hi-hat (H), and Ride (R).  
- Crash (C) line is empty—no changes needed.  
- Ride (R) line is empty—no changes needed.  
- Hi-hat (H) contains hard and soft closed hits (`X` and `x`)—these are cymbal hits, so they all should be removed (replaced with `-`).  
- Kick (K) and Snare (S) lines remain unchanged.  
- Toms (T) line is empty.
