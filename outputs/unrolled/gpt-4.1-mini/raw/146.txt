The original groove has kick, snare (with some open and soft snare hits), and ride cymbal, but no hi-hat.

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only hi-hat but also snare.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Currently no hi-hat is present, so I will add a closed hi-hat pattern (soft closed hits 'x') on eighth notes to add groove and consistency.  
- Keep snare hits as they are or slightly more pronounced to satisfy the request.  
- Keep kick and ride as is for groove consistency.
