The current groove includes:  
- Kick with soft hits spread out evenly.  
- Snare with hard sidestick hits on offbeats (positions 6 and 11).  
- Hi-hat with sparse soft closed hits (`x`).  
- Ride cymbal already present, playing a pattern with mixed hard and soft closed hits on the bow (`x` and `X`).  
- No crash cymbal.

---

**Request:** The groove should have **not only cymbal but also ride**.  
We have cymbal (hi-hat) and ride cymbal already, so the groove satisfies the request. 

However, the hi-hat hits are sparse.

---

**Thought process:**  
- To better fulfill a groove with both cymbal and ride, I will add more consistent hi-hat hits to complement the ride.  
- Add soft closed hi-hat hits (`x`) on every 8th note offbeat (3,7,11,15 - i.e., the "ands") for a steady pattern.  
- Keep existing parts unchanged.

Final hi-hat line:  
`--x-|x-x-|--x-|x-x-`
