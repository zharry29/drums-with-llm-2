The original groove contains kick, snare, and closed hi-hat hits, but no toms and no ride cymbal.

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only tom but also ride.

---

**Thought process:**

- Add tom hits to bring toms into the groove.
- Add ride cymbal hits to incorporate ride.
- Keep kick, snare, and hi-hat parts unchanged.
