The original hi-hat pattern is:

```
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
```

That's a repetitive pattern of hard closed hit (X), soft closed hit (x), and two rests per beat.

---

**Request:** Make hi-hat pattern more varied.

---

### Thought process:

- Keep a rhythmic theme but add some open hi-hat hits (`o` or `O`) to add texture.

- Vary the pattern per beat to avoid monotony.

- Use rests intentionally to create groove.

- Possibly add some syncopation or accented hits.

---

### Implementation:

Beat 1: `Xoxo` — hard closed, soft open, soft closed, soft open

Beat 2: `x-X-` — soft closed, rest, hard closed, rest

Beat 3: `oxoX` — soft open, soft closed, soft open, hard closed

Beat 4: `X--x` — hard closed, two rests, soft closed

---

### Final hi-hat line:

```
H: Xoxo|x-X-|oxoX|X--x
```

---

### Final groove:
