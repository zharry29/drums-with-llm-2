The request is to remove kick and cymbal hits.

---

**Thought process:**
- Kick line (K) is empty, so no change needed.
- Crash cymbal (C) is empty, so no change needed.
- Ride cymbal (R) contains closed bell hits (`x` and `X`), so replace all with `-`.
- Snare line (S) is empty.
- Hi-hat line (H) contains soft closed hits (`x`), keep as is.
- Toms line (T) is empty.

Final groove:
