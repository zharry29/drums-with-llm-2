Let's analyze the snare (S) line in the given groove:

```
S: ----|O---|----|O---
```

There are two main snare hits, both hard hits `O` on the 1st 16th note of beats 2 and 4.

---

**Request:** Add some ghost notes on the snare.

- Ghost notes are soft snare hits, denoted by `o`.

- They usually appear on off-beats or 16th notes near main hits to add subtle rhythmic texture.

---

### Plan:

- Add ghost notes softly before or after main hits to maintain groove.

- For beat 2 (`O---`), we can insert a ghost note on the 3rd 16th note → `O-o-`.

- For beat 4 (`O---`), insert a ghost note on the 2nd 16th note → `Oo--`.

---

### New Snare line:

```
S: ----|O-o-|----|Oo--
```

Final groove:
