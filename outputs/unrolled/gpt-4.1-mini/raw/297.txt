The original groove has kick, snare, and crash but no hi-hat or ride. The edit request wants the groove to have not only **ride** but also **snare**. Snare is already present, but ride is missing. So I will add a ride cymbal pattern that fits the groove while keeping the current snare hits.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kick, snare, and crash cymbal as they are.  
- Add ride cymbal closed hits (`x`) on steady 8th notes for rhythmic drive.
