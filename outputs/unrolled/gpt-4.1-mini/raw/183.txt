The original groove has kicks, snare hits, and a repeating tom pattern, but no ride cymbal. The request is to add ride cymbal as well as keep the toms.

**Thought process:**  
- Add soft or hard ride cymbal hits (e.g., closed hits 'x' or 'X', or open bell hits 'O' or 'o') to complement the groove without overpowering it.  
- Keep the existing tom pattern and other parts unchanged.
