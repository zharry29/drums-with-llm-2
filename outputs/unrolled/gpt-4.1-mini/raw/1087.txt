To make this groove sound more like a metal groove, here is what I will do:

- Add a driving double-kick pattern on the kick drum to establish intensity and speed.

- Snare hits on beats 2 and 4, hard hits for power and with slight ghost notes for groove.

- Hi-hat pattern switched from sparse soft hits to constant hard closed (`X`) 16th notes for aggression.

- Keep toms silent or add small fills.

- Keep crash cymbals minimal to keep focus on aggressive rhythms.

- Retain the ride cymbal pattern with harder and more frequent hits, possibly converting soft closed hits to hard closed hits.

### Original groove:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

### Edited groove:

- Kick: steady 16th notes, using hard hits.

- Snare: hard hits (`O`) on beats 2 and 4 with ghost notes (`o`) before main hits.

- Hi-hat: constant hard closed 16th notes (`X`).

- Ride: change all to hard closed (`X`) to complement the aggressive feel.
