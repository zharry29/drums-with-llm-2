The original groove currently has:  
- Kick hits on beats 1 of bars 1, 2, and 4.  
- Snare hit on first 16th note of beat 3 (bar 3).  
- Toms with a pattern of hard and soft hits (`O-o-`) on each beat, consistent throughout the bar.  
- No cymbals so far.

---

**Request:** The groove should have cymbal **and** tom. Currently, toms are already present, but no cymbals.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add cymbal hits—specifically ride cymbal—to add texture without overwhelming tom pattern.  
- Add ride cymbal soft closed hits (`x`) evenly on offbeats (positions 3,7,11,15) for a steady ride rhythm.  
- Since the groove lacks hi-hat or crash cymbals, I will add hi-hat soft closed hits (`x`) on downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13) for cymbal presence beyond toms and ride.  
- Keep kick, snare, and tom patterns as-is.
