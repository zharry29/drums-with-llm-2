The original groove features:

- Soft kicks at positions 1, 6, 9, and 14

- Snare sidesticks on 6 and 11

- Soft closed hihat hits on 6 and 16

- Ride cymbal alternating between soft and hard closed bow hits

---

**Request:** Add some cymbal to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**

- The groove currently has ride cymbal driving the rhythm.

- To add some cymbal flavor, adding a crash cymbal on downbeats will add accent and dynamics.

- Let's add hard crash cymbal hits (O) on downbeats of beat 1 and 3 (positions 1 and 9).

- Keep crashes minimal to not clutter the groove.
