Let's analyze the groove and identify the downbeats of 2 and 4:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

- The bar has 16 16th notes, divided into four groups of four notes (the beats).
- The downbeat of 2 is the 5th sixteenth note (the first character after the first `|`).
- The downbeat of 4 is the 13th sixteenth note (the first character after the third `|`).

Looking at the Snare line:

- At position 5 (downbeat 2): `O` (hard hit)
- At position 13 (downbeat 4): `O` (hard hit)

The request is to avoid having snare hits on the downbeat of 2 and 4, so we replace these with `-`.

Updated Snare line:

- Position 5: from `O` to `-`
- Position 13: from `O` to `-`

Resulting Snare line:

`----|-o-o|-o--|---o`
