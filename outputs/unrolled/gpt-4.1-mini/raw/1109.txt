The 'a' of the second beat corresponds to the 4th 16th note of beat 2. Counting 16th notes from 0 to 15, beat 2 covers positions 4 to 7:  
- 4 = 1  
- 5 = e  
- 6 = &  
- 7 = a

So position 7 is where the cymbal hit should be added in the second beat.

Currently, the cymbal lines C and R have no hits:  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

Adding a cymbal hit on position 7. Since no specific cymbal or articulation is mentioned, adding a Crash cymbal hard hit 'O' there makes sense.

Updating the Crash cymbal line at beat 2 from `----` to `---O`.
