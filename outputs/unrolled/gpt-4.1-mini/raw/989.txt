The original kick pattern hits on:  
- Beat 1: position 1 (hard `O`)  
- Beat 2: position 1 (hard `O`)  
- Beat 4: position 1 (hard `O`)

The requested edit is to fill the whole bar with double kick, which typically means two kicks per beat, usually on the 1st and 3rd 16th notes of each beat (positions 1 & 3, 5 & 7, 9 & 11, 13 & 15).

I will replace the kick line with hard hits (`O`) on those positions for the entire bar.

Other instruments remain unchanged.
