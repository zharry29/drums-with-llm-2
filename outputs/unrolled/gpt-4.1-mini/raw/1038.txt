The original snare hits are on the 3rd beat, 1st 16th note:

```
S: ----|----|O---|----
```

To make the snare hits more dynamic while keeping the same placement (beat 3, 1st 16th note), I can:

- Add ghost/snare embellishments around the main snare hit without changing its position.  
- Change the articulation on some hits (hard `O` vs soft `o` or open hits).  
- Incorporate sidestick hits (`X` or `x`) near the snare hit for texture.

Possible approach:

- Leave the hard snare hit on beat 3, 1st 16th note (`O`).  
- Add a soft open snare hit (`o`) immediately after the main snare (3rd beat, 2nd 16th note) as a grace note.  
- Add a soft sidestick (`x`) just before the snare hit (2nd beat, 4th 16th note) to give a "ghost note" feel leading into the snare.

Adjusted snare line:

```
S: ----|---x|Oo--|----
```

Explanation:

- Beat 2, 4th 16th note: soft sidestick `x`  
- Beat 3, 1st 16th note: hard snare `O`  
- Beat 3, 2nd 16th note: soft open snare `o`

The rest of the groove remains unchanged.
