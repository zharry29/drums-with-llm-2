The original groove has no tom hits (T line is silent):

```
T: ----|----|----|----
```

The request is to keep the same placement of tom (which means no tom hits) but make it more dynamic.

Since there are no tom hits at all, there is no placement to change or make more dynamic.

Therefore, tom line remains silent.
