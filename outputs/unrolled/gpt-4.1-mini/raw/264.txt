The original groove contains kick, snare, and crash cymbal, but no hi-hat. The request is to have not only cymbal but also hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add closed hi-hat hits (`x`) on every 8th note to provide a steady pulse alongside the crash and kick.  
- Keep existing kick, snare, and crash cymbal unchanged.
