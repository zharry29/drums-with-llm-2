The original groove:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a kick hit and ride in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Kick drum (K) first character is "O" (hard hit), so the kick hit is already present.
- Ride cymbal (R) first character is "-", so add a closed hard ride hit "X" on the bow.
- Other parts remain unchanged.

Final groove:
