The original groove has kick, snare, and hi-hat (closed sidestick) hits but no ride or tom hits. The request is to add ride cymbal and toms.

**Thought process:**  
- Add ride cymbal hits, typically on the bow (X) or bell (O) to maintain a steady pulse or accent on the groove.  
- Add tom hits (hard hits 'O') to add melodic and rhythmic variety â€” perhaps on off-beats or between kick/snare patterns.  
- Keep the rest of the pattern intact.
