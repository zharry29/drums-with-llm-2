The original groove has kick, snare, and closed hi-hat (X) hits, but no toms.

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only tom but also hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep existing kick, snare, and hi-hat hits as is to preserve feel.  
- Add toms on some notes to incorporate tom sounds without overpowering groove.
