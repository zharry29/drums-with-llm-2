The current groove contains no kick drum, but it has ride cymbal playing on 16th notes (positions 1, 5, 9, 13) with mixed hard and soft closed hits, and hi-hat with some closed soft hits.

---

**Request**: The groove should have *not only kick but also cymbal*.  
Currently, no kick drum hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add kick drum hits to satisfy "not only kick but also cymbal."  
- Keep the ride cymbal as cymbal presence. Optionally, add a crash cymbal for more texture.  
- I will add kick on beats 1 and 3 downbeats (positions 1 and 9).  
- Also add crash cymbal hard hits at the same positions to accentuate the groove.

Final lines:  
- Kick: `O---|----|O---|----`  
- Crash: `O---|----|O---|----`

Other parts remain the same.
