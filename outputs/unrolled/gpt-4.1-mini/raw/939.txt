The request is to remove the kick drum hits on beat 4 (positions 13-16) but keep everything else intact.

Examining the kick drum (K) line at beat 4:

- Beat 4: `"-OO-"` â†’ There are two hard kick hits (O) on the 14th and 15th 16th notes, so we need to replace these four characters with `"----"` to remove the kick hits on beat 4.

All other lines remain unchanged.
