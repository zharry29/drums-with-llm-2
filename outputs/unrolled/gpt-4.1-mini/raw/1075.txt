Let's analyze the original groove:

- Hi-hat line is silent (`----|----|----|----`).

---

**Request:** Make the hi-hat pattern more varied.

---

### Thought process:

To add a varied hi-hat pattern that complements the groove:

- Use a mix of soft closed (`x`), hard closed (`X`), soft open (`o`), and hard open (`O`) hits.

- Add rhythmic interest by alternating hits on 8th notes and some 16th note subdivisions.

- For example, a pattern like:

  - Beat 1: `xoxo` (soft closed, soft open, soft closed, soft open)

  - Beat 2: `X---` (hard closed on first 16th)

  - Beat 3: `xoxo` again

  - Beat 4: `X-o-` (hard closed, soft open on 3rd 16th)

This gives a nice, dynamic hi-hat line.

### Final hi-hat line:

`xoxo|X---|xoxo|X-o-`

### Final groove:
