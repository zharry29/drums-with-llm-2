To complement a bass guitar that plays on each quarter note downbeat in a jazzy style, the common approach is:

- Place a kick drum on each quarter note downbeat to lock in with the bass.

- Use the snare drum lightly on some backbeats or ghost notes for groove.

- Keep the hi-hat and ride as is or maybe add some ride bell hits on the off beats or swing pattern.

- Maintain subtle and loose feel typical of jazz.

Currently, there is no kick or snare. I'll add kick hits on all quarter note downbeats (positions 0, 4, 8, 12).

I'll add soft sidestick snare ghost notes on the "and" of beats 2 and 4 for subtle swing.

Keep the hi-hat and ride pattern but make the right hand ride bell hits a little sparser to leave room for bass.
