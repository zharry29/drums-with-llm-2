The request is to have the snare (S) play on every 16th note in the second beat.

Let's analyze the second beat (positions 5 to 8 in the 16-character sequence ignoring `|`):

Positions for beat 2: characters 5,6,7,8 (the 4 sixteenth notes in beat 2)

We need the snare to have notes in all these 4 sixteenth note positionsâ€”all four should be played. We'll use hard hit "O" for impact.

Current snare line:

```
S: ----|O---|----|O---
```

The snare hit "O" is on the first 16th note of beat 2 (character 5), we will add hits to positions 6,7,8.

**Updated snare:**

Positions 5-8 all "O":

```
S: ----|OOOO|----|O---
```

Rest of the groove unchanged.
