The original groove includes kick, snare, and toms, but no ride cymbal. The edit request wants both snare and ride, which means I need to add a ride cymbal pattern while keeping the existing instruments.

**Thought process:**

- Keep kick, snare, and toms as they are.  
- Add a ride cymbal pattern. Common practice is steady 8th notes (every 2 16th notes) using soft or hard closed bow hits (`x` or `X`).  
- No hi-hat or crash cymbal requested, so I will not add those.
