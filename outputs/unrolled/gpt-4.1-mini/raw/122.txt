The original groove has kick and toms but no ride or crash cymbal.

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only ride but also cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add ride cymbal hits to complement the groove.  
- Add crash cymbal hits on downbeats for cymbal presence.  
- Keep kick, snare, tom parts as they are.
