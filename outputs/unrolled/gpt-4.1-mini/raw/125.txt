The original groove includes kick, snare (though “S” is not defined in the legend—it seems like a typo or meant as “O”), hi-hat, tom, and crash cymbal, but no ride cymbal.

**Request:** Groove should have not only ride but also cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Crash cymbals are already present.  
- Ride cymbal is missing; add some ride hits on steady quarter or offbeat notes to complement the groove.  
- Correct the questionable snare hit “S” to a hard hit “O.”  
- Keep other instruments unchanged.
