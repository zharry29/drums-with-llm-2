The original groove currently has no kick drum hits at all, only some soft and hard closed hihat hits on the offbeats and a ride cymbal pattern.

**Request:** Groove should have not only kick but also hihat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The groove lacks kick drums, so I will add kick hits to provide some low-end rhythm.  
- The hi-hat already exists but is sparse; I will add closed hi-hat soft hits (`x`) on every 8th note (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15) to create a steady pulse.  
- Keep ride cymbal pattern unchanged.
