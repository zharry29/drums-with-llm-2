The current groove's snare line already has a variety of hits â€” a mix of hard (O) and soft (o) snares, providing a syncopated rhythm. The request is to add some snare to the groove, so I'll look to add a bit more presence without overpowering the existing pattern.

**Thought process:**

- Snare hits currently appear at positions 6, 7, 10, 13, and 16.

- To add some extra snare, I'll add:  
  - A hard snare hit on the "a" (position 8) of beat 2, joining the Oo-o pattern to OoOo  
  - A soft snare hit on the "e" (position 11) of beat 3, to add rhythmic interest  
  - A soft snare hit on the "e" (position 14) of beat 4 to complement the "O--o"  

This keeps the groove balanced and interesting.
