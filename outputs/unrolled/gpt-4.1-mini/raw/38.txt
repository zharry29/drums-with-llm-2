Looking at the original groove:

- Kick hits are present on beats 1, the "and" of beat 2, beat 3 downbeat and the "and" of beat 3.
- Snare has hits on beat 2 downbeat and beat 4 downbeat.
- Hihat is active with a mix of hard and soft open hits on beats.
- Crash cymbal plays on beat 1 downbeat.
- No ride cymbal.

---

**Request:** Add some ride to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Ride cymbal typically adds a continuous pulse or accents the bell on downbeats or offbeats.
- To fit the groove, I will add ride hits on every downbeat (positions 1, 5, 9, 13) with hard open bell hits ("O") for clarity.
- Additionally, I'll add softer open bell hits ("o") on the "and" of every beat (positions 3,7,11,15) to create a driving ride pattern.
- This will complement the existing kick and hihat without overcrowding.

Ride line:  
Positions 1,5,9,13 = O  
Positions 3,7,11,15 = o
