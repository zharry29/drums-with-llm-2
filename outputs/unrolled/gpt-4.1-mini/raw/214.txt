The original groove has only hi-hat closed hits (‘x’ and ‘X’) and ride cymbal closed and open hits, but no crash cymbal. The request is to add cymbal in addition to hi-hat.

**Thought process:**  
- Add crash cymbal hits ('O') to introduce cymbal presence, typically on the downbeat to accent the groove.  
- Keep hi-hat and ride parts as is.
