The request is to play the closed hi-hat on all 8th notes (both downbeats and upbeats), but have the hits open on every upbeat, and keep all hits hard.

Positions within the 16 sixteenth notes bar:  
- Downbeats (quarter notes): 1, 5, 9, 13  
- Upbeats (the "ands"): 3, 7, 11, 15  

At these positions:  
- Closed hi-hat on downbeats = `X`  
- Open hi-hat on upbeats = `O`  
- All other sixteenth notes are silent = `-`

Therefore, the hi-hat pattern is:  
`X-O-|X-O-|X-O-|X-O-`

Other parts remain unchanged.
