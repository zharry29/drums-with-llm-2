The original groove:

```
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a kick hit and ride in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Kick drum (K) first character is "O" (hard hit), so the kick hit is already present.
- Ride cymbal (R) first character is "-", no ride hit present yet.
- Add a hard closed ride hit "X" on the bow at the first 16th note.
- Other parts stay the same.
