The original groove has soft kicks, sidestick snare hits, soft closed hi-hat, and an active ride cymbal pattern. There are currently no tom hits.

**Thought process:**  
- Add some tom hits (hard ‘O’) to provide tonal variation and fill the request.  
- Keep the ride cymbal pattern since it already fulfills the "ride" part.  
- Maintain the general softness of the groove by adding tom hits sparingly.
