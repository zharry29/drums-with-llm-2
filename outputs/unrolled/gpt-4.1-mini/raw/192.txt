The original groove already has kick, snare (soft and open hits), and hi-hat hits but no toms or ride cymbal. The edit request asks for toms and also snare, so it seems to want more pronounced or perhaps additional snare hits along with toms.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits ('O' for hard hits) sparinglyâ€”perhaps on the offbeats or near snare hits to create color and movement.  
- Add some hard snare hits ('O') on key backbeats (beats 2 and 4) or other places to complement the current soft snare hits.  
- Maintain the overall groove structure.
