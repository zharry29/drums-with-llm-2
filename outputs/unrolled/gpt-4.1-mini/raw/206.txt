The original groove has kicks on beats 1 and 3, snare on beats 2 and 4, and hard closed hi-hat hits (X) on the downbeat 16th note each beat.

The request is that the groove should have not only snare but also hi-hat. The hi-hat is already present but only on first 16th note of each beat, so I will add more hi-hat hits for a more consistent groove by adding closed hi-hat hits on every 8th note (every second 16th note).

**Thought process:**  
- Add soft hi-hat closed hits ('x') on the off 16th notes, filling the space between the existing 'X' hits to keep steady 8th-note rhythm.  
- Keep kicks and snare unchanged.  
- No other instruments added.
