Let's analyze the original ride pattern first:

```
R: ----|----|----|----
```

There are **no ride hits** currently.

The request is to keep **the same placement of ride but more dynamic**.

Since there are no ride hits to begin with, we can't place any hits without changing the placement.

Therefore, the ride will stay silent.
