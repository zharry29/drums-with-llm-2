To create a half-time feel while keeping everything else the same, we need to make the groove feel slower in terms of backbeat placement, typically by placing the snare hits on beat 3 instead of 2 and 4. The kick pattern will also be adjusted to maintain the groove.

Original groove:

- Kick: hits on beat 1 and 3.

- Snare: hits on beat 2 and 4.

- Hi-hat: hits on beat 1.

---

### Half-time feel adjustments:

- Snare hits move to beat 3.

- Kick becomes more sparse, typically hits on beat 1 only or possibly on beats 1 and 3 to maintain pulse.

- Hi-hat pattern unchanged â€” to preserve feel.

---

### Notation:

- Kick on beat 1 only (first 16th note of bar).

- Snare on beat 3 (first 16th note of third beat).

- Hi-hat on beats 1, 2, 3, 4 (as original: hit on first 16th of each beat).
