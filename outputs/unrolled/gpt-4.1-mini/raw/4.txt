The original groove:

- Kick drum: mostly fills — "OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO"  
  Kick hits concentrated on beats 1 and 3 primarily, with some syncopation.

- Snare: hits on beat 2 and 4 (typical backbeat)

- Hihat: silent

- Toms: no hits

- Crash cymbal: crash hits on the downbeats of all four beats

- Ride: silent

The request is to add tom to the groove.

Thought process:

- The bar is quite busy with kick and crash cymbals, so the toms should complement without cluttering.

- Toms are often used for fills or to add extra rhythmic interest in sections between snare and kick hits.

- I'll add toms mainly around the 2nd and 4th beats where snare hits.

- I'll add some soft tom hits 'o' on the off-beats and a few hard tom hits 'O' to accent.

Positions (four beats × 4 16ths = 16 positions):

1-4: beat 1  
5-8: beat 2  
9-12: beat 3  
13-16: beat 4

I will add:

- Beat 2: soft toms on 6th and 8th 16th notes (positions 6 and 8)

- Beat 3: hard tom on 11th (third 16th of beat 3)

- Beat 4: soft tom on 15th 16th note

So T line:

Positions 6,8 → o  
Position 11 → O  
Position 15 → o

All others rests (-)

This yields:

T: ----|o--o|--O-|--o-
