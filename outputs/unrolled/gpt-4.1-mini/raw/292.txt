The original groove has kick, snare, and ride (with a soft and hard open bell hit pattern), but no hi-hat. The edit requests that the groove should have both hi-hat and ride. Since ride is already present, I will add a hi-hat pattern that complements the existing groove.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the kick, snare, and ride patterns as is.  
- Add hi-hat closed soft hits (`x`) on off-beats (every second 16th note) to complement groove without overpowering.
