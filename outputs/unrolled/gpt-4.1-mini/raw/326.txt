The original groove has soft kicks, sidestick snare hits (`X` on the S line), closed hi-hat hits, and closed ride hits on the R line.

The request is to remove any ride or snare hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Remove all snare hits (`X`) → replace with `-` in the S line.  
- Remove all ride hits (`x` and `X`) → replace with `-` in the R line.  
- Keep the kick and hi-hat hits as is.
