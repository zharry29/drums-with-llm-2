Let's analyze the original kick (K) pattern:

```
K: O---|O---|----|O---
```

- Beat 1: kick on 1st 16th, hard hit `O`
- Beat 2: kick on 1st 16th, hard hit `O`
- Beat 3: no kick hits
- Beat 4: kick on 1st 16th, hard hit `O`

---

**Goal:** Keep the same kick placement but add more dynamics.

---

### How to add dynamics without changing the hit placement?

- Vary hit intensity by switching some hard hits `O` to soft hits `o`.

- Add subtle ghost hits on the same 16th notes is not allowed, as placement must be same.

- Possible to soften the second or fourth kick to create dynamic variation.

---

### Proposed changes:

- Change the kick on beat 2 from hard `O` to soft `o` to create dynamic contrast.

- Keep beats 1 and 4 hard `O`.

---

New kick pattern:

```
K: O---|o---|----|O---
```

### Final groove:
