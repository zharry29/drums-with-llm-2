The original groove:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a hihat hit and kick in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Kick (K) first character is 'O' (hard hit), so no change needed.
- Hi-hat (H) first character is 'X' (hard closed hit), so already a hit there, no change needed.
- The request is to add a hi-hat hit and kick at the start, both are already present.

Final groove remains the same:
