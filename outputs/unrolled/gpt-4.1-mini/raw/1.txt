The original groove is very minimal:

- Kick and snare silent
- Hihat plays soft closed hits on the second 16th note of beats 2 and 4
- Ride plays a pattern of closed hits on the bow (x and X alternating), fairly constant across beats
- No toms

The request is to add toms.

Since there is a subtle, sparse pattern on hihat and ride, and no kick or snare, I'll carefully add some tom hits to contribute rhythmic interest without overpowering the groove.

Thoughts:

- Add soft tom hits (o) around beat 2 and 4 to complement the existing hihat hits, maybe on the "a" of beat 2 and the "e" or "a" of beat 4.
- Alternatively, add a hard tom hit (O) on beat 3 to give some mid-bar accent.

I will do the following:

- Soft tom hits on the "a" of beat 2 (8th 16th note) and "e" (14th) of beat 4
- Hard tom hit on beat 3, second 16th note (9th in total), adding a midpoint accent

Notation positions:

- 16 16th notes indexed as 1 to 16 (ignoring |),
- Beat 1: notes 1-4
- Beat 2: notes 5-8
- Beat 3: notes 9-12
- Beat 4: notes 13-16

So:

- Add hard tom hit (O) at note 9 (beat 3, 1st 16th = 9, 2nd 16th = 10) - I pick 9 here for a stronger start of beat 3
- Add soft tom (o) at note 8 (beat 2, 4th 16th note) - "a" of beat 2
- Add soft tom (o) at note 14 (beat 4, 2nd 16th note) - "e" of beat 4

Let's place them:

T: ----|---o|O---|--o-
