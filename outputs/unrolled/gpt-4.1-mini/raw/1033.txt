The original groove has no cymbal hits at all:

```
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

The hihat has hits on the first 16th note of every beat (hard closed hits `X`), but the request is to keep the same placement of **cymbal** hits and make them more dynamic.

Since there are no cymbal hits initially, keeping the same placement means keeping it silent on cymbals.

Therefore, no cymbal hits will be added or moved.

As the request is about cymbals and their dynamic, and there are none, I will keep cymbal lines unchanged. The hihat can remain the same.
