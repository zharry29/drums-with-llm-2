The original groove has:

- Kick drum playing a busy pattern with mostly hard hits on almost every 16th note except a few places.

- Snare on beats 2 and 4 downbeats.

- Crash cymbal hitting on all downbeats.

- No hihat or ride.

---

**Request:** Add some ride to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**

- Adding ride cymbal to complement the groove.

- Ride can mark steady pulse or accent beats.

- Here, since kick is busy, I'll add ride on every 8th note (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15) with soft closed hits (x) to provide ride texture and support the groove without overpowering.

- Hard open bell hits (O) can be added on the downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13) for clarity.

---

Ride pattern:

- Positions 1,5,9,13: O

- Positions 3,7,11,15: x

- Other positions: -
