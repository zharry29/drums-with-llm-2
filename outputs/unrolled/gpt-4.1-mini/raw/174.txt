The given groove has kicks, snare hits, closed/open hi-hat hits, and a crash cymbal on the first beat of the bar. However, it currently has no tom hits.

---

**Thought process:**

- Add some tom hits ('O' for hard hits) to create more melodic and rhythmic interest, placing them where they complement the existing groove.  
- Keep the cymbal presence (crash) as it is.  
- Keep the groove balanced with the kick, snare, and hi-hats as given.
