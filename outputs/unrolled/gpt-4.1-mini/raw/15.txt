Let's analyze the original groove's kick pattern:

- Beat 1: O O O - (positions 1,2,3 hard kicks)  
- Beat 2: - - O - (position 10 hard kick)  
- Beat 3: O O O - (positions 9,10,11 hard kicks)  
- Beat 4: - O O O (positions 14,15,16 hard kicks)  

Quite a heavy kick presence already, especially in beat 1 and 3.

Request: Add some kick to the groove.

Thoughts:

- The kick is very busy on beat 1 and 3, moderate on beat 2, and beat 4 is strong on the last three 16th notes.

- Adding more kick may risk cluttering, but we can look for spaces to add softer kicks to complement the groove.

- Beat 2 seems the sparsest with two 16th notes open before and after the kick.

- Add soft kicks (o) on positions 5 and 7 (the "e" and "a" 16th notes of beat 2) for groove fill.

- Beat 4, position 13 is free (the downbeat of beat 4), add a soft kick there.

Kick line after additions:

- Beat 1: O O O -  
- Beat 2: o - O o (positions 5(o), 6(-), 7(o), 8(-))  
- Beat 3: O O O -  
- Beat 4: o O O O (positions 13(o), 14(O), 15(O), 16(O))
