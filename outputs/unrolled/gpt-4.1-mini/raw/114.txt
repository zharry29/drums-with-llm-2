The original groove already has kick (`K: O---|----|O---|----`) and no tom hits (`T: ----|----|----|----`).

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only tom but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Kick is present, so keep as is.  
- Add tom hits to include toms. A simple soft tom pattern will work well here, for example placing soft tom hits on the "and" of beats 2 and 4 to complement the existing groove.  
- Keep other parts unchanged.
