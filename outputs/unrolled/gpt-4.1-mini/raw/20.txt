The original groove has:

- Kick with hits on: 1, 4, 11  
- Snare with ghost and open hits spread throughout  
- No hihat or toms or crash cymbal  
- Ride cymbal plays a swinging pattern with both soft (o) and hard (O) bell hits, on offbeats

---

**Request**: Add some cymbal to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**

- Ride cymbal already fills steady rhythmic space.

- Adding crash cymbal to accent the start of the bar and possibly the downbeat of beat 3 would add dynamics.

- Add crash hits on positions 1 and 9 (downbeats of beats 1 and 3).
