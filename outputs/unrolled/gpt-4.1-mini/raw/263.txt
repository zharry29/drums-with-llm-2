The original groove has kick, snare, crash cymbal, and some open/soft hi-hat hits (o and O), but no closed hi-hat hits (`x`) which usually represent "hi-hat" proper. The request is to have not only cymbal but also hi-hat, so I will add a steady closed hi-hat pattern on the off-beats (the "&" of each beat) to enhance the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the original kick, snare, and crash cymbal as is.  
- Add closed hi-hat hits (`x`) on the 8th notes where the original hi-hat is silent; keep existing open hi-hat hits as they are for dynamics.  
- This creates a fuller hi-hat part with a mix of closed and open sounds.
