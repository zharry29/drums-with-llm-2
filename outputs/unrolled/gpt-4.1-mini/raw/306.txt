The original groove has kick, snare, and hi-hat, but no cymbal (crash or ride). The request wants not only snare but also cymbal. So I will add ride cymbal hits to complement the groove while keeping existing parts.

**Thought process:**

- Keep kick, snare, and hi-hat as they are.  
- Add ride cymbal closed hits (`x`) on steady 8th notes for a driving feel.  
- Leave tom and crash empty.
