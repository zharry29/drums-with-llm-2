The original snare line is:

```
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
```

Let's analyze the snare placement more precisely by beat and 16th note position.

Each beat has 4 sixteen notes, the `|` separate beats:

- Beat 1: `----` → no hits  
- Beat 2: `Oo-o` →  
  - 1st 16th: `O` (hard hit)  
  - 2nd 16th: `o` (soft open hit)  
  - 3rd 16th: `-` (no hit)  
  - 4th 16th: `o` (soft open hit)  
- Beat 3: `-o--` →  
  - 1st 16th: `-` (no hit)  
  - 2nd 16th: `o` (soft open)  
  - 3rd 16th: `-`  
  - 4th 16th: `-`  
- Beat 4: `O--o` →  
  - 1st 16th: `O` (hard hit)  
  - 2nd and 3rd 16th: `-`  
  - 4th 16th: `o` (soft open)

The request is to keep the **same placement** but make it **more dynamic** — so hits remain on the same 16th-note positions, but articulation can vary to create dynamics.

Possible improvements to increase dynamics here:  
- Add some sidestick hits (`X` or `x`) in places currently empty between snare hits to add texture.  
- Vary articulation: alternate some soft open snare (`o`) to hard sidestick (`X`) or vice versa.  
- Add ghost notes using soft hits in currently silent places if possible.

Following these principles:

- On beat 2:  
  Keep hard hit at 1st sixteenth (`O`), change 2nd and 4th sixteenths from soft open hits (`o`) to *alternating* soft sidesticks (`x`) and soft open hits (`o`) to add variation: let’s say 2nd 16th `x` (soft sidestick), 4th 16th `o` (soft open).  

- On beat 3:  
  2nd 16th is already soft open (`o`), add a very soft sidestick just before it (1st 16th = `x`) for ghost note feel.

- On beat 4:  
  Keep hard hit at 1st 16th (`O`), change the last 16th soft open (`o`) to soft sidestick `x` for added dynamics.

Revised snare line will be:

```
S: ----|Ox-x|-o--|O--x
```

Explanation:  
- Beat 2: `O` (hard), `x` (soft sidestick), `-`, `x` (soft sidestick)  
- Beat 3: `x` (soft sidestick), `o` (soft open snare), `-`, `-`  
- Beat 4: `O` (hard snare), `-`, `-`, `x` (soft sidestick)

This keeps same timing but introduces more dynamic contrast.
