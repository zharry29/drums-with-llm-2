The original groove has kick, snare, and ride cymbal hits, no toms.

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only tom but also ride.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep existing ride cymbal pattern.  
- Add some tom hits to the groove, fitting naturally with kick/snare pattern.  
- Preserve the rest as is.
