The original groove has kick (`K`) hits and tom hits (`T`) already:

- Kick: `-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-`
- Tom: `----|----|---O|----`

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only tom but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**

- Kick is present, but some hits are soft (`-O--` means the first 16th note is silent, second is hard kick).  
- Snare includes an ambiguous `S` which is not defined in the legend. Possibly a typo â€” I will treat it as hard snare (`O`).  
- Add some more kick hits for a stronger groove while keeping tom hits.  
- Maintain the hi-hat and crash pattern as is.
