The original groove has kick, snare, and toms, but no ride or hi-hat. The request asks to add ride along with kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add ride cymbal pattern to complement the groove.  
- Use closed ride hits (`x`) on every 8th note to keep a steady pulse and support the kick and toms.  
- Keep the rest of the groove unchanged.
