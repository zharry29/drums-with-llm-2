Let's analyze the original groove:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

We need to add an **open hihat on the last 8th note**.

- Each bar has 16 sixteenth notes (4 beats × 4 sixteenth notes per beat).
- The last 8th note is the 15th sixteenth note (since the 8th notes are pairs of two sixteenth notes).
- Counting the hihat line (each character is a sixteenth note):

Positions 13-16 (last beat):

- The last group is `O-o-`
- Characters at these positions (compared to previous groups):

Positions:

13: O  
14: -  
15: o  
16: -  

- The 15th sixteenth note is currently `o` (soft open hihat).
- Since request is to have an open hihat on the last 8th note, this is already present as `o`.
- So no change is necessary.

However, to be certain, let's verify which note exactly is the "last 8th note":

- Beats subdivided as:

  - 1–2 (sixteenths 1–2) → first 8th note  
  - 3–4 → second 8th note  
  ...  
  - 15–16 → last 8th note (two sixteenth notes)

Therefore, the last 8th note is positions 15 and 16.

Currently, at position 15, hihat is `o` (soft open hit), position 16 is `-` (no hit).

So it has an open hihat at the last 8th note’s first sixteenth.

Hence, it already fulfills the request.

Because the request is to add an open hihat on the last 8th note, and we already have a soft open hihat there, no change is needed.
