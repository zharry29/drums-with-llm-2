The original groove only has ride cymbal playing (x and X-x- patterns), and soft closed hihat hits on the "e" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4 (positions 6 and 16).

Request: Add some cymbal to the groove.

---

Thought process:

- Currently no crashes or other cymbals.

- To complement the ride pattern, adding some crash cymbal hits on downbeats would add emphasis.

- Add hard crashes (O) on the downbeats of beat 1 and 3 (positions 1 and 9) to avoid cluttering.

- Keep crash hits sparse to keep groove balanced.

New crash cymbal line:

Positions 1 and 9: O---|O---
