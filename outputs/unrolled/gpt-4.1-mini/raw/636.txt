The original groove:

```
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a kick hit and ride in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Kick drum (K) first character is "O" (hard hit), so kick is present.
- Ride cymbal (R) first character is "-", so add a hard closed ride cymbal hit "X" (closed bow).
- Leave all other parts unchanged.
