The original cymbal lines are:

```
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

The only cymbal hits are hard crash cymbal hits (`O`) on the first 16th note of beat 1 only.

The request is to keep the same placement of cymbal (so the hit at that exact spot) but make it more dynamic.

To do this, I can vary the articulation at that position or add additional cymbal hits around it (as long as strictly at the same placement).

Since there is only one crash cymbal hit, I'll do the following:

- Change the crash cymbal hit at beat 1, 1st 16th note from hard (`O`) to a sequence emphasizing dynamicsâ€”e.g., a hard crash (`O`) immediately followed by a soft crash hit (`o`) at the 2nd 16th note to offer a dynamic accent.

- Add a soft open ride cymbal (`o`) at the same 16th note as the crash (beat 1, 1st 16th note) to layer and increase dynamic texture.

This keeps the timing of cymbal hits intact and enhances dynamics.

Updated lines:

```
C: Oo--|----|----|----
R: o---|----|----|----
```

Rest of the groove stays the same.
