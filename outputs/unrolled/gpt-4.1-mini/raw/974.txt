The request is to reduce the number of notes in the groove, making it simpler or sparser, while maintaining the overall feel.

Looking at the groove, we can reduce some notes on various instruments:

- **Kick (K):** Current notes at positions 1,5,7,9. Remove some to lighten the kick pattern.
- **Snare (S):** Current notes at position 6 and 14. Keep one or both, possibly removing one.
- **Hihat (H):** Multiple notes across beats, can remove some notes to simplify.
- **Crash (C):** Hits on the downbeat of each beat. Maybe keep the first and remove some.
- **Ride (R):** No hits, leave as is.

Possible simplification:

- Kick: Keep only the first note (position 1) and the one at position 7.
- Snare: Keep only the note at position 14.
- Hihat: Keep just one note on beat 2 (position 6) or spread lightly.
- Crash: Remove all crash notes for sparseness.

Here's the edited groove with fewer notes:
