The given groove already includes kicks (K) and some snare hits (S) using 'O', 'o' articulations, but the snare hits are a bit sparse and soft. The request is to ensure the groove has not only kick but also snare, so I will keep the kicks intact and enhance the snare presence slightly by adding a few more clear snare hits for stronger feel.

**Thought process:**

- Keep existing kick hits as is.  
- Add a few additional hard snare hits ('O') to strengthen the snare role.  
- Maintain the soft snare hits for groove feel.  
- Leave hi-hat, tom, crash, ride as is (none present except ride pattern).
