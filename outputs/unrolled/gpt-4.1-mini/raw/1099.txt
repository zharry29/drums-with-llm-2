To add more low frequency sounds, we can add more kick drum hits and possibly introduce tom hits. The current groove has a few kick hits spread out and no tom hits.

Steps:

- Increase the kick density with more 16th note kick hits to bring low-end presence.

- Add tom hits on some offbeat 16th notes to reinforce low-mid frequencies without cluttering the groove.

Keeping the original snare and hi-hat patterns as is.

---

**Changes planned:**

- Kick: add hits on positions 3 and 7 (counting from 0) in the first two beats to fill out the bass.

- Toms: add accented tom hits on beats 3 and 4 offbeats.
