The request is to remove kick and cymbal hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Kick line (K) contains hard and soft hits (`O` and `o`), zero those out to all `-`.  
- Ride line (R) contains hard and soft closed hits and open hits (`o`, `O`), zero those out to all `-`.  
- Snare (S) contains hits, keep as is.  
- Hi-hat (H) is empty.  
- Toms (T) is empty.  
- Crash (C) is empty.
