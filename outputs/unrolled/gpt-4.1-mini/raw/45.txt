The original groove features:  
- Kick on beats 1 and 3 downbeats.  
- Snare on beats 2 and 4 downbeats.  
- Hi-hat already playing hard closed hits (X) on downbeats (positions 1, 5, 9, 13).  
- No ride or crash.  

---

**Request:** Add some hi-hat to the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- The hi-hat currently only hits on the downbeat 16th notes.  
- To add more hi-hat presence and drive, I'll add soft closed hi-hat hits (‘x’) on the offbeats (positions 3, 7, 11, 15), which are the "and" of each beat.  
- This will create a steady eighth-note pulse between existing hard hits without clutter.

Final hi-hat line:  
Positions 1,5,9,13 = X (hard closed)  
Positions 3,7,11,15 = x (soft closed)  
Others = -
