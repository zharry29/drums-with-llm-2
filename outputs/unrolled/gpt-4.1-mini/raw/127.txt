The original groove contains kick, snare, and crash cymbal, but no toms and no ride cymbal.

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only tom but also ride.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits to bring in toms (currently none).  
- Add ride cymbal hits to include ride element (currently none).  
- Keep kicks, snares, and crashes unchanged.
