The original groove has no tom hitsâ€”the T line is silent:

```
T: ----|----|----|----
```

The request is to keep the *same placement* of toms but make it more dynamic. Since there are no tom hits at all, keeping the same placement means still no tom hits, so no change is possible or expected on the tom line.

No other instructions for changes, so all other parts remain unchanged.
