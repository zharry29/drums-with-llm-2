Let's analyze the groove:

- Kick on downbeat of beats 1, 2, and 4.

- Snare on downbeat of beat 3.

- Toms play a syncopated pattern, alternating hard and soft hits.

- No cymbals present.

---

**Request:** Add some cymbal to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**

- Since the toms carry a melodic rhythm, adding some ride cymbal to complement the groove is a good choice.

- Let's add ride cymbal soft closed hits (x) on all the off-beats ("e" and "a" 16th notes), i.e., positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, to keep the motion moving.

- Add crash cymbal on the downbeat of beat 1 for a strong accent.
