The original groove contains kick, snare, and closed hi-hat hits (X) but no cymbal (crash or ride). The request is to have not only cymbal but also hi-hat. So I need to add a cymbal part while keeping the hi-hat present.

**Thought process:**  
- Add crash cymbal hits (`O`) on strong downbeats to add cymbal presence.  
- Keep existing kick, snare, and hi-hat pattern unchanged.  
- Add crash cymbal sparingly to avoid clutter.
