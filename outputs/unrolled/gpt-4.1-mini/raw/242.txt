The original groove already has toms (T line has alternating hard and soft hits), and a snare hit on the 3rd beat 1st 16th note of the 3rd measure. The request is to have both snare and toms, so the snare is currently sparse and could be enhanced a bit for better presence alongside the toms.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the tom pattern as is to preserve the groove's character.  
- Add some snare hits to complement toms without overpowering (e.g., add another snare on the 4th beat of the 1st and/or 4th measure).  
- Keep kicks intact.
