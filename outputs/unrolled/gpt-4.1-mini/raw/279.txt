The original groove already has snare sidesticks (`X` and `X`), and ride cymbal (`x` and `X-x-`). The edit request asks the groove to have not only snare but also ride, which is already true, so I will keep the groove as is but clarify the snare line to explicitly show snare hits instead of just sidesticks, adding some soft or hard snare hits to emphasize snare presence alongside the ride.

**Thought process:**  
- Add some soft and hard snare hits (`O` or `o`) alongside the sidesticks to emphasize snare.  
- Keep ride cymbal pattern unchanged.
