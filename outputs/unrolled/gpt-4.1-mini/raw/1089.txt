To convert this groove to sound more like a metal groove, here are the main adjustments I'll make:

- **Kick drum:** In metal, fast and steady double-kick or steady 16th note kicks are common to provide intensity. I'll add more consistent 16th note kicks.

- **Snare drum:** Keep hard hits on 2 and 4, with ghost notes (`o`) before the main hits for groove and aggressiveness.

- **Hi-hat:** Metal uses constant hard closed 16th note hi-hat hits (`X`), sometimes open for accents. I'll create a driving hi-hat pattern mixing hard closed and open hi-hats.

- **Toms:** Usually used in fills or accents; keep silent here for focus.

- **Crash and Ride:** Not used here; keep it minimal.

### Proposed metal groove:

Kick:

- Steady 16th kicks on beats 1 and 2.

- Double kicks on beats 3 and 4.

```
K: OOOO|OOOO|OOOO|OOOO
```

Snare:

- Hard hits on 2 and 4 (`O`).

- Ghost notes (`o`) on off-16th notes before main hits.

```
S: ----|oO-o|----|oO-o
```

Hi-hat:

- Constant 16th note hard closed (`X`) except open hi-hat (`O`) on the 3rd 16th note of beats 2 and 4 to add texture.

```
H: XXXX|XOXO|XXXX|XOXO
```
