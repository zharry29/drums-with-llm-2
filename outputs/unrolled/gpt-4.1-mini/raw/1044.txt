Let's analyze the snare pattern from the original groove:

```
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
```

- Beat 1: no hits  
- Beat 2: 1st 16th note: `X` (hard sidestick)  
- Beat 3: 3rd 16th note: `X` (hard sidestick)  
- Beat 4: no hits

---

To keep the **same placement** but make it **more dynamic**, we can:

- Add some softer sidestick hits (`x`) in the surrounding 16th notes as ghost notes.  
- Add variation by throwing in some soft open snare hits (`o`) as accents near the sidesticks, maintaining timing.

Proposed changes for snare:

- Beat 2: Keep hard sidestick `X` on 1st 16th. Add a soft sidestick `x` on 3rd 16th.  
- Beat 3: Keep hard sidestick `X` on 3rd 16th. Add a soft open snare `o` on 2nd 16th.  
- Beat 4: Add a soft sidestick ghost note `x` on 2nd 16th to add dynamics without changing placement of hits.

Thus, snare becomes:

```
S: ----|X-x-|o-X-|--x-
```
