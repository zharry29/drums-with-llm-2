The original groove already contains hi-hat (`H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-`), with hard and soft closed hits happening steadily every beat.

**Request:** The groove should have not only kick but also hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The hi-hat is present but could be a bit more filled or emphasized to make the "hi-hat" presence unmistakable.  
- I will fill in more hi-hat 16th notes so that it plays on every 16th note with a dynamic mix of hard/soft closed hits, increasing cymbal presence while keeping groove natural.  
- Keep kick and snare as is.
