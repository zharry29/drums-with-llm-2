The original tom hits are:

```
T: ----|----|---O|----
```

There is a single hard tom hit (O) on the 3rd beat, 3rd sixteenth note (position 14 overall in the bar).

The request: keep the same placement but make it more dynamic.

To make the tom more dynamic without changing its placement, I can add softer hits (o) surrounding the main hard hit to create a dynamic pattern, like ghost notes or grace notes. For example, add a soft hit before or after the main hit. Let's try adding a soft hit immediately before the hard hit, making the pattern `--oO` on the 3rd beat, replacing `---O`.

That translates to the 3rd beat’s four 16th notes as: `- - o O` → positions 13(-), 14(-), 15(o), 16(O).

But the original is four characters `---O`, so the last character is position 16, so the O is at position 16.

So better to put soft hit at position 14 and hard hit at 16: `-o-O`. Or `--oO` if we prefer.

Let’s pick `-o-O`:

- position 13: `-` (no hit)  
- position 14: `o` (soft)  
- position 15: `-` (no hit)  
- position 16: `O` (hard)  

So change `---O` to `-o-O` on the third beat.

Keep the rest at `----`.

So tom line becomes:

```
T: ----|----|-o-O|----
```
