Let's analyze the original groove:

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

We need to add **an open hihat on the last 8th note**.

- Each bar has 16 sixteenth notes divided into groups of 4.
- The last 8th note is the 15th sixteenth note (counting from the start).
- The hihat line has `x` or `X` for closed hits, `o` or `O` for open hits.
- Currently, the last beat (fourth group) hihat is `x-x-`.
- Positions in the last group are: 13,14,15,16 sixteenth notes.
- The 15th note is the third character in the last group.
- Currently, the character at position 15 is `x` (closed hit).
- The request is for an open hihat on the last 8th note (15th sixteenth), so replace the `x` at position 15 with `o` (soft open hit) or `O` (hard open hit).
- Since the notation uses lowercase mostly, use `o` for a soft open hit.

Updating the hihat line:

Last group from `x-x-` to `x- o -`.

So, new hihat last group: `x-o-`.

All else remains unchanged.
