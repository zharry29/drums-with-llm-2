The original groove has kicks and snare hits, and a consistent tom pattern, but no hi-hat hits. The request is to include hi-hat in addition to snare.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add a steady closed hi-hat pattern ('x') on every 8th or 16th note to create a rhythmic foundation.  
- Keep kicks, snare, and toms unchanged.  
- Keep cymbals silent as none were present or requested.
