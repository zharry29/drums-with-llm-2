The original groove:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
```

Request: "I'd like a ride hit and tom in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Ride cymbal (R) first character is "o" (soft open bell hit), ride is already present but soft. I'll keep this as is (a ride hit is present).
- Tom (T) first character is "-", so no tom hit in the very beginning.
- Add a tom hard hit "O" at the first 16th note.
- Other parts remain unchanged.
