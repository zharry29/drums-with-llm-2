The request is to play the closed hi-hat on all 16th notes, with accents on quarter note downbeats.

Hi-hat notation:  
- `X` = hard closed hit (accent on downbeat)  
- `x` = soft closed hit (non-accent)

There are 16 sixteenth notes in a bar, with downbeats at positions 1, 5, 9, 13. Those get `X`, others get `x`.

Original hi-hat line:  
`----|x---|----|x---`

Replace with:  
`Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx`

All other instruments remain unchanged.
