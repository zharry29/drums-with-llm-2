The original groove already has snare sidestick hits ('X') on beats 2 and 3 of bars 2 and 3, and hi-hat soft closed hits ('x') on off-beats in bars 2 and 4, and some ride cymbal closed and open hits.

The request is that the groove should have not only snare but also hi-hat. Since both are present but hi-hat is a bit sparse, I will enhance the hi-hat with more steady closed hits to strengthen the rhythm while keeping the subtle feel.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep snare sidesticks as is for groove texture.  
- Add regular soft closed hi-hat hits ('x') on every 8th note (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 16th notes) for a steady groove.  
- Keep kicks and ride parts unchanged.
