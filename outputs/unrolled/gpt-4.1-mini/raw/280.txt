The original groove has kick, snare, and closed hi-hat hits, but no ride cymbal. The edit request wants both snare and ride. Since snare is already present, I will add a ride cymbal part while keeping the other parts intact.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kick, snare, and hi-hat as is.  
- Add ride cymbal (`x`) hits on steady 8th notes (every 2 16th notes) to create a consistent ride pattern.
