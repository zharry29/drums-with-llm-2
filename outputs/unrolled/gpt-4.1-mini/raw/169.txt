The original groove has no kick or snare hits — only some soft closed hi-hat hits and ride cymbal hits. The request asks for the groove to have not only kick but also snare. That means I need to add both kick and snare hits.

**Thought process:**  
- Add kick hits to provide a basic pulse — commonly on beats 1 and 3.  
- Add snare hits on beats 2 and 4 for a traditional backbeat feel.  
- Keep hi-hat and ride patterns as they are to maintain groove feel.
