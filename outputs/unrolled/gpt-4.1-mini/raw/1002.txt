The request is to:  
- Play the closed hi-hat on all 8th notes,  
- Use open hi-hat on every upbeat,  
- All hits are hard.

**Understanding the pattern:**  
- A bar has 16 16th notes.  
- The 8th notes fall on every even 16th note, i.e., positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15.  
- The quarter note downbeats are at positions 1,5,9,13 (1st 16th of each beat).  
- The upbeats (the “&” of each beat) are at positions 3,7,11,15 (the 3rd 16th of each beat).  
- For this pattern, closed hi-hat on downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13) as `X` (hard closed), open hi-hat on upbeats (positions 3,7,11,15) as `O` (hard open).  
- The remaining 16th notes (positions 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16) are unplayed `-`.

So, for the hi-hat line, 16 characters split into 4 beats (4 characters each):  
Positions:  
1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 | 9 10 11 12 | 13 14 15 16  
Hits:  
X - O - | X - O - | X - O - | X - O -  

Original hi-hat line: `----|----|----|----` (empty)  
Change to: `X-O-|X-O-|X-O-|X-O-`

All other instruments remain unchanged.
