Let's analyze the snare (S) line:

```
S: ----|----|O---|----
```

The only snare hit is a hard hit (`O`) on the 1st 16th note of beat 3.

---

**Request:** Add ghost notes on the snare.

- Ghost notes are soft snare hits, represented by `o`.

- They typically appear on the off-beats or in between main hits for subtle rhythmic texture.

---

### Plan:

- Add ghost notes on some 16th notes in beats 1, 2, and 4 where the snare is silent, without interfering with main hit on beat 3.

- Suggested placements for ghost notes:

  - Beat 1: add ghost note on 3rd 16th note → `--o-`

  - Beat 2: add ghost note on 2nd 16th note → `-o--`

  - Beat 4: add ghost note on 4th 16th note → `---o`

### New snare line:

```
S: --o-| -o--|O---|---o
```

To keep consistent formatting (no spaces):

```
S: --o-|o---|O---|---o
```

But since the second beat is `-o--` (ghost on 2nd 16th), it's clearer as:

```
S: --o-|-o--|O---|---o
```
