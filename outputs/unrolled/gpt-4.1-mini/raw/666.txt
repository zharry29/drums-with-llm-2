The original groove:

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

Request: "I'd like a ride hit and kick in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Kick drum (K) first character is 'o' (soft hit). To add a hard kick hit at the beginning, change 'o' to 'O'.
- Ride cymbal (R) first character is 'x' (soft closed hit on the bow). The request is to add a ride hit at the very beginning. Since there's already a soft ride, let's replace with a hard open hit on the bell 'O'.
- Other lines remain the same.
