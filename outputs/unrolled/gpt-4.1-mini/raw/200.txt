The original groove has kick and snare hits along with some hi-hat hits indicated by 'o' (soft open hits) and 'O' (hard open hits). The request is to ensure the groove has not only snare but also hi-hat. Since hi-hats are already present but mostly open hits, I will add some closed hi-hat hits (x) to create a tighter groove and emphasize the hi-hat presence.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kicks and snares as is.  
- Add closed hi-hat hits (x) on the off 16th notes or on every 8th note to strengthen hi-hat rhythm.  
- Retain some open hi-hat hits for dynamics and color.
