The original groove has kick drum hits on the downbeats of beats 1 and 3, snare on beats 2 and 4 downbeats, and consistent hard closed hihat hits on all downbeats. No cymbals are present yet.

To add some cymbal, we could add crash cymbal hits on the downbeats of beats 1 and 3 to emphasize those beats, matching the kick accents.
