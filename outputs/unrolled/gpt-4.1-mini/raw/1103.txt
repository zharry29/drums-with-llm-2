To add more low frequency sounds, the typical instruments to enhance are the kick drum and toms. Currently, the groove has only soft kicks (o) and no tom hits.

Plan:

- Add some hard kick hits (O) on the strong beats to increase low end presence.

- Possibly add some tom hits on offbeat 16th notes to add body.

- Keep snare and cymbals as is to retain groove character.

Implementation:

- Replace soft kicks with hard kicks on beats 1 and 3 (positions 0 and 8).

- Add a hard kick on the "and" of beat 2 (6th 16th note).

- Add tom hits on the "e" of beat 4 (14th 16th note).
