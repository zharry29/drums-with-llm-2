The original groove has kicks, hi-hats, tom hits (one hard tom hit in the third measure), and crash cymbals, but no snare (noted as "S" which seems incorrect) and no ride cymbal.

**Request:** Groove should have not only tom but also ride.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Fix the snare line by replacing "S" with a proper hit (likely hard hit "O").  
- Keep the kick and crash cymbal pattern the same.  
- Maintain the tom hit as is.  
- Add ride cymbal parts, typically steady quarter or eighth notes on ride cymbalâ€™s bow (using 'x' or 'X').  
- Keep hi-hat pattern intact.
