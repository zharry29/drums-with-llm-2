The original groove includes kick (`K`), snare (`S`), hi-hat (`H`), and crash cymbal (`C: O---|----|----|----`), but no ride cymbal (`R: ----|----|----|----`).

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only ride but also cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**

- Add ride cymbal hits to the groove while keeping the crash cymbal as is.
- I will add some soft ride hits on the off-beats for a flowing feel without overpowering.
- Keep kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash unchanged.
