The current groove has:  
- Kick drum with a mix of hard and soft hits.  
- Snare with hard hits on beats 2 and 4.  
- Hi-hat with varying open and soft hits, giving a dynamic feel.  
- Crash cymbal on the downbeat of the first bar.  
- No toms currently.

---

**Request:** Add toms to complement the existing groove with cymbals.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits to enrich the groove without cluttering it.  
- Place soft tom hits (`o`) on offbeat 16th notes in bar 3 and 4 to keep the groove moving forward and interesting.  
- Positions 6 and 14 (second and fourth beat offbeats) seem fitting.
