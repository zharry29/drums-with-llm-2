The original groove already has kick, snare, and hi-hat parts but no ride. The request is to add ride along with the kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add closed ride hits (`x`) on the off-beats or 8th notes to complement the existing hi-hat pattern without overcrowding.  
- Maintain the existing kick, snare, and hi-hat parts.  
- Keep the ride pattern rhythmically consistent and supportive.
