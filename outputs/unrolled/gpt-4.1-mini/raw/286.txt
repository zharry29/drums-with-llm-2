The original groove has kick, snare, and crash cymbals, but no ride cymbal. The edit request requires the groove to have not only snare but also ride, so I will keep kick, snare, and crash as is, and add a ride cymbal pattern.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the kick pattern intact.  
- Keep the snare hits as is.  
- Keep the crash on downbeats.  
- Add ride cymbal (`x`) on steady 8th notes for a natural ride feel.
