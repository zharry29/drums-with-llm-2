The original groove contains kicks, snare, and closed hi-hat hits, but no ride cymbal (`R:` line empty) or crash cymbal (`C:` line empty).

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only ride but also cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**

- Add ride cymbal hits to add that element.  
- Add crash cymbal hits to include cymbal.  
- Place crash on downbeats (beat 1, beat 3), ride on steady off-beats or quarter notes.  
- Keep kick, snare, and hi-hat as is.
