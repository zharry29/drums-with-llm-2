The original groove has kick, snare, and hi-hat, but no ride cymbal. The edit requests that the groove should have both ride and snare. Since snare is present, I will add a ride cymbal pattern complementing the groove.

**Thought process:**

- Keep kick, snare, and hi-hat unchanged.
- Add ride cymbal (`x` for hard closed hits) steady on every 8th note (every two 16th notes).
