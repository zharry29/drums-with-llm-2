The original groove has kick, snare, and toms, but no hi-hat or cymbal hits. The request is to include both hi-hat and cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add a steady closed hi-hat pattern ('x') for rhythmic pulse.  
- Add crash cymbal hits ('O') on the first beat of each bar to add cymbal presence.  
- Keep the kick, snare, and tom parts unchanged.
