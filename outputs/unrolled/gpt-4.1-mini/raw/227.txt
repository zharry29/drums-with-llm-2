The original groove has kick, snare with soft hits, and ride bell cymbal hits, but no toms.

Request: Groove should have not only kick but also tom.

**Thought process:**  
- Add some tom hits to accentuate the groove; a good spot is in the second half of bar 3 and maybe a complementary tom hit late in bar 4 to keep natural phrasing.  
- Keep existing kick, snare, and ride parts unchanged.  
- Use hard tom hits (‘O’) for clarity.
