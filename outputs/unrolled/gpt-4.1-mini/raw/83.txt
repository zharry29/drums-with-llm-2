The current groove consists of:  
- Kick hits on beats 1 of bars 1 and 3.  
- Snare hits on beat 2 of bars 2 and 4.  
- Hi-hat hard closed hits (`X`) steady on the downbeats (beats 1, 5, 9, 13).  
- No toms present.

---

**Request:** Groove should have **not only cymbal but also tom**.  
We need to add tom hits to complement the existing parts.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits with soft articulation (`o`) to add tonal variety without overpowering the groove.  
- Place tom hits on the upbeat 4th 16th note (position 4 in the first and third beats) and the upbeat 12th 16th note (position 12 in beats 3 and 4), creating a complementary pattern with the kick and snare.  
- Keep all other parts unchanged.
