The original groove includes kick, snare (though marked as "S" which is not standard notation — I'll interpret it as a soft snare hit ‘o’ for better notation), hi-hat, tom, and crash cymbals, but no ride cymbal.

The edit request says the groove should have not only snare but also ride. Since snare is present, I will keep snare and add ride cymbal patterns.

**Thought process:**

- Replace the non-standard 'S' in snare line with a soft snare open hit 'o' to follow given notation.  
- Keep the kick pattern as is.  
- Keep hi-hat and tom.  
- Keep crash cymbals.  
- Add ride cymbal (`x`) on steady 8th notes to complement the groove.
