The original groove has ride cymbal hits and sparse hi-hat closed hits, but no kick. The request is to have both ride and kick. I will add a subtle kick pattern to complement the ride without overpowering the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the ride cymbal hits as they are.  
- Add kick hits on downbeats and some offbeats for groove.  
- Keep hi-hat hits unchanged to maintain the texture.
