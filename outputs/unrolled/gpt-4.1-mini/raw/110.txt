The original groove already includes kick (`K: O--O|----|--O-|----`) and no tom hits (`T: ----|----|----|----`).

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only tom but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Kick is already present, so keep it as is.  
- Add tom hits to satisfy the request. I will add soft tom hits complementing the kick pattern for rhythmic variety.  
- Place soft tom hits on positions where there is some space (e.g., 7th and 13th 16th notes) without overlapping kick or snare.  
- Keep all other parts unchanged.
