The original snare line is completely silent:

```
S: ----|----|----|----
```

The request is to keep the **same placement** of snare but make it **more dynamic**. Since there are no snare hits currently, the only option to keep the same placement is to keep it silent, meaning zero snare hits.

To still add some dynamics related to the snare area without changing placement, I can consider adding **very soft ghost snare touches** right off the main pulse (which would be at no place here, so none), but that would change placement, which is not allowed.

Therefore, the snare will remain silent.
