The original ride cymbal line is silent:

```
R: ----|----|----|----
```

The request is to keep the **same placement of ride** but make it **more dynamic**.

Since there are no ride hits currently, the only possible way to keep the same placement is to keep it silent.

Therefore, no ride hits will be added.
