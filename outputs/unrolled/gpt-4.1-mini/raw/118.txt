The original groove contains only kick, snare, and crash cymbal hits, but no ride cymbal hits (`R: ----|----|----|----`). The crash cymbal (`C:`) is already present on the downbeats.

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only ride but also cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Currently, there is no ride cymbal (`R:` line empty).  
- Add some ride cymbal hits to compliment the existing crash cymbals.  
- Keep kicks, snare, and crashes unchanged.
