The original groove features only soft kick hits (`o`) on some offbeats (positions 1, 6, 9, 14), a few snare sidestick hits, sparse hi-hat soft closed hits, and a ride pattern.

---

**Request:** The groove should include not only hi-hat but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The existing kick hits are soft and sparse. To emphasize the kick presence, I will upgrade some to hard kicks (`O`) on beats 1 and 3 (positions 1 and 9), and add an additional hard kick on beat 2 (position 5).  
- Keep hi-hat and all the other parts unchanged.  
- This creates a stronger and more grounded groove.
