The current groove has:  
- Kick with varied hard and soft hits.  
- Snare with hard hits on beat 2 and 4 downbeats.  
- Hi-hat with open hits (`O` and `o`) creating a slightly loose feel.  
- Crash cymbal on the first downbeat.  
- No ride cymbal hits.

---

**Request:** The groove should have **not only cymbal but also ride**.  
Currently, only crash cymbal present â€” no ride cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep all existing parts as is.  
- Add ride cymbal hits to complement the groove.  
- Use closed soft ride hits (`x`) on the "ands" of beats (offbeats) positions 3,7,11,15, to give subtle ride pulse.  
- This adds ride presence without crowding the groove.

Final ride cymbal line:  
`--x-|--x-|--x-|--x-`
