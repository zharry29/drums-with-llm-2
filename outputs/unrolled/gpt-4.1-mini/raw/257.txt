The original groove has no kick and the given ride and hi-hat pattern. The request is to have not only the ride but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The ride and hi-hat are already present; we need to add kick beats.  
- Add kick hits in a way that complements the ride pattern, possibly on the downbeats (1 and 3) to provide a steady foundation.  
- Keep other instruments as is.
