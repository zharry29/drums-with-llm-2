The original groove has:

- No kick hits currently.

- Hihat has two soft closed hits on the "e" of beat 2 (position 5) and the "and" of beat 4 (position 16).

- Ride cymbal plays a steady pattern on the downbeats and some offbeats.

---

Request: Add some kick to the groove.

---

Thought process:

- To keep the groove balanced and subtle, add kick hits on the downbeat of beat 1 (position 1) and on the "and" of beat 3 (position 12).

- This will create a simple foundational pulse.

---

Kick line:

Positions 1 and 12 → O

Rest → -
