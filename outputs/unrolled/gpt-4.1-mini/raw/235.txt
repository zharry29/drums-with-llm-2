The original groove currently has no snare and no toms — only hi-hat soft closed hits (x) and ride cymbal patterns.

The request says: "The groove should have not only snare but also tom." So I need to add snare hits along with tom hits.

**Thought process:**  
- Add snare hits on typical backbeats (usually beats 2 and 4, or around there) to define the groove. Since the bar is divided into 16 16th notes, the snare can be placed at the 5th and 13th 16th notes (beats 2 and 4).  
- Add tom hits complementing the snare and rhythm — maybe on the offbeats or slightly before/after the snare to add interest.  
- Keep existing hi-hat and ride cymbal patterns as they are.
