The original groove has kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash cymbal but no toms.

---

**Request:** Add toms and also hi-hat (hi-hat is present, so mainly add toms).

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep existing kick, snare, hi-hat, crash as is for groove feel.  
- Add subtle tom hits to complement the groove, making sure to add tom presence without overpowering.
