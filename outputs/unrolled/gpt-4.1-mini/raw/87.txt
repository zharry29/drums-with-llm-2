The current groove consists of:  
- Kick pattern with varied hits.  
- Snare pattern with mixed hard and soft hits and open sounds.  
- Hi-hat playing a steady alternating hard/soft closed pattern.  
- No toms are present.  
- No cymbals other than hi-hat.

---

**Request:** Add toms to the groove that already has cymbal (hi-hat).

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add toms with soft hits (`o`) to blend with the groove without overpowering.  
- Tom hits placed on 3rd 16th note of beat 3 (position 11) and 1st 16th note of beat 4 (position 13) in the third and fourth beats respectively, to complement kick and snare.  
- Keep other instruments unchanged.
