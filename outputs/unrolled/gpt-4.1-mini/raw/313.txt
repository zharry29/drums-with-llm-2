The original groove has kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash cymbal hits, but no ride cymbal. The request says the groove should have not only snare but also cymbal. Since the crash cymbal is already present (C line), I will add ride cymbal hits to enhance the cymbal presence.

**Thought process:**
- Keep kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash as is.
- Add ride cymbal closed hits `x` on steady 8th notes for rhythmic continuity.
- Leave toms empty as in the original.
