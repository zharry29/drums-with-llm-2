The original groove has a dense kick pattern already (`K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO`) and crash cymbals on the downbeats, but no toms at all (`T:` line is empty).

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only tom but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Kick is plentiful, so keep it as is.  
- Add some tom hits to fulfill the request â€” I will add a subtle groove using soft toms to complement the kick pattern without overcrowding.  
- Leave snare and other parts unchanged.
