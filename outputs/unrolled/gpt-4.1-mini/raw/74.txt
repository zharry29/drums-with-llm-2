The current groove has:  
- Kick with mixed hard and soft hits.  
- Snare with open and soft hits.  
- No hi-hat.  
- No crash cymbal.  
- Ride cymbal with a pattern of soft and hard bell hits every beat.

---

**Request:** Groove should have **not only cymbal but also ride**.  
We have ride cymbal (`R`) but no other cymbal. The request likely means to add another cymbal in addition to ride, such as hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add hi-hat closed soft hits (`x`) on offbeats (positions 3,7,11,15) to complement the ride pattern and add the other cymbal presence requested.  
- Keep kick, snare, ride as is.  
- No crash or toms added.

Final hi-hat line:  
`--x-|--x-|--x-|--x-`
