The original groove features soft kick, snare sidesticks, some hi-hat closed soft hits (`x`), and a ride cymbal pattern. The request is for the groove to have not only cymbal but also hi-hat, suggesting adding more hi-hat presence alongside the ride cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The hi-hat is currently very sparse with just two soft closed hi-hat hits in the bar.  
- I will add steady closed hi-hat hits (`x`) on every offbeat 8th note to give the groove a fuller hi-hat feel while keeping the gentle character.  
- The ride cymbal pattern remains unchanged to retain its cymbal presence.
