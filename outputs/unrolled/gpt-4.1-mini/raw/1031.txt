The original cymbal line is:

```
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

This shows a pattern on the ride cymbal bow with:

- Beat 1: soft closed hit (x) on 1st 16th note  
- Beat 2: hard closed (X) on 1st, soft closed (x) on 3rd 16th notes  
- Beat 3: soft closed (x) on 1st 16th note  
- Beat 4: same as beat 2: hard closed (X) on 1st, soft closed (x) on 3rd  

The request is to keep the same placement of cymbal hits but make it more dynamic.

To enhance dynamics while keeping placements, I can:

- Vary articulation between hard/soft closed (`X`/`x`) and add occasional open hits (`O`/`o`) on the same 16th note positions.  
- Add some ghost hits (soft hits) on off 16th notes near the existing ones without changing original hit placements.  
- Alternatively, alternate hard and soft hits on repeated positions.

Implementing this, I'll:

- Beat 1: change `x---` to `Xo--` (hard closed + soft open)  
- Beat 2: change `X-x-` to `XO-o` (hard closed + hard open + soft open) giving more expressiveness  
- Beat 3: change `x---` to `Xo--`  
- Beat 4: `X-x-` â†’ `XO-o`

This keeps all original hit placements but adds some open and accented hits for dynamics.
