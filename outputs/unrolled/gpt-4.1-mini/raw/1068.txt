Let's analyze the snare (S) line:

```
S: ----|----|S---|----
```

There's only one snare hit, the character `S` at the 1st 16th note of beat 3.

Note: The problem statement doesn't specify `S` as a standard symbol, but since it's on the snare line, this may be a typo or special hit; assuming it's a hard snare hit (`O`) or a sidestick.

For the purpose of this task, I will interpret `S` as a hard snare hit (`O`).

---

**Request:** Add ghost notes on the snare.

Ghost notes are soft hits, usually `o` (soft open hit) or `x` (soft sidestick). Since original main hit is on the head, we add `o` ghost notes.

---

### Plan:

- Keep the main snare hit at beat 3 position 1.

- Add ghost notes (`o`) on adjacent off-beats or quieter subdivisions for subtle rhythmic texture.

---

### Implementation:

- Add a ghost note `o` on the 3rd 16th note (position 3) of beat 2: this fills an empty spot and adds groove subtlety.

- Add ghost notes `o` on 2nd and 4th 16th notes in beat 3 alongside main hit (resulting pattern like `Oo-o` or `Oo--`).

- Add a ghost note `o` on 4th 16th note of beat 4 to keep groove consistent.

---

### New Snare line:

Beat-by-beat (4 chars per beat):

- Beat 1: silent → `----`

- Beat 2: ghost note on 3rd 16th → `--o-`

- Beat 3: main hit + ghost notes → `Oo-o`

- Beat 4: ghost note on 4th 16th → `---o`

---

### Final Snare line:

```
S: ----|--o-|Oo-o|---o
```

Final groove:
