The original groove already contains kick hits (`K: O---|---o|O-O-|----`) and no tom hits (`T: ----|----|----|----`).

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only tom but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**

- Kick is present so keep existing kick hits.
- Add tom hits to fulfill the "not only tom but also kick" request.
- I'll add some rhythmic tom hits complementing the kick pattern: soft tom hits on off-beats in the 2nd and 3rd bars and a hard tom hit in the 4th bar.
- Keep all other parts unchanged.
