The edit request is to play the closed hi-hat on all 16th notes with accents on the quarter note downbeats.

Notation for hi-hat:  
- `X` = hard closed hit (accent on downbeat)  
- `x` = soft closed hit (non-accent)

The quarter note downbeats are at positions 1, 5, 9, and 13 in the 16-character line.

We will place `X` on these positions, and `x` on all other 16th notes.

Original hi-hat line:  
`X---|X---|X---|X---`

New hi-hat line:  
`Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx`

All other instruments remain unchanged.
