The original groove includes ride cymbal hits (`R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-`) but no crash cymbal hits (`C:` line is empty).

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only ride but also cymbal (crash).

---

**Thought process:**

- Ride is present, so keep it unchanged.  
- Add crash cymbal hits to complement the ride pattern, placing them tastefully on downbeats to avoid clutter: for example, on the start of bars 1 and 3.  
- Keep other part unchanged.
