The groove already has kicks on beats 1, 3, and some soft hit variations, and snare hits on beat 2 and the last 16th note of the bar. The request asks for groove to have not only kick but also snare. To make the snare presence more clear and balanced alongside the kick, I will add an extra snare hit on beat 4 as well as a slightly more assertive snare hit on beat 2, adjusting for dynamics.

**Thought process:**  
- Snare hits mainly on beats 2 and 4, sometimes with subtle open hits.  
- Add a stronger “O” snare hit on beat 4 to complement the kick hits.  
- Keep hi-hat and crash cymbal as is to keep the groove consistent.

(Note: The snare is already on beat 4; to increase presence, I'll add a second snare hit on the "and" of beat 3 (13th 16th note) as a soft hit 'o', to emphasize snare presence.)
