The request is to fill the entire bar with double kick, which usually means two kick hits per beat, on the 1st and 3rd 16th notes of each beat.

Original kick hits are sparse:

- Beat 1: positions 1, 4 (hard hits `O`)  
- Beat 3: position 11 (hard hit `O`)

To fill with double kick, I'll put hard hits `O` on positions 1 & 3, 5 & 7, 9 & 11, 13 & 15.

Other instruments should remain unchanged.
