The original groove has kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash, but no ride cymbal. The edit request requires adding ride in addition to the hi-hat already present.

**Thought process:**

- Keep existing kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash cymbal patterns intact.  
- Add ride cymbal (`x` for hard closed hits on the bow) playing steady 8th notes for a rhythmic lift complementing the hi-hat.  
- Keep the ride pattern consistent, emphasizing the groove without overpowering the hi-hat.
