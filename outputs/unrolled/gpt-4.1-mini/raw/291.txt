The original groove contains hi-hat closed hits (`x` in H) and ride cymbal closed hits (`x` and `X-x-` in R) but lacks any snare or kick. The edit request says the groove should have not only hi-hat but also ride. Since both hi-hat and ride are already present, no addition is strictly required.

However, the kick and snare are silent, which makes the groove feel empty. But the request doesnâ€™t ask to add kick or snare, only to ensure the groove has hi-hat and ride, which it already does.

Therefore, I will keep the groove as is, maybe just tidy spacing for readability.
