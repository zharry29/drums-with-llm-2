The original groove features kick, occasional snare hits, and a repeating tom pattern. There are no cymbal hits at present. The request is to add a cymbal while keeping both toms and existing elements.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Introduce crash cymbal hits (hard hits 'O') at the start of bar 1 and possibly bar 3 to complement the groove.  
- Keep kick, snare, and toms unchanged to preserve feel.  
- No need to add ride or hi-hat unless requested.
