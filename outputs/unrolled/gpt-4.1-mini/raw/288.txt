The original groove features kick, snare, and clearly marked hard closed hi-hat hits (`X`), but no ride cymbal (`R`) noted. The edit request specifies that the groove should have not only hi-hat but also ride. Since the hi-hat is already present, I'll add a ride cymbal pattern that fits well with this groove, retaining the existing parts.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kick and snare as is.  
- Keep hi-hat pattern as is.  
- Add ride cymbal closed hits (`x`) on steady 8th notes to complement the groove.
