Currently, the groove has:  
- No kick or snare.  
- Hi-hat with soft closed hits (`x`) only twice, on the offbeat of beat 2 and beat 4.  
- Ride cymbal with mixed hard and soft closed hits (positions 1, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15).  

---

**Request:** It should have **not only ride but also hi-hat**.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The hi-hat is present but very sparse (only two soft hits).  
- To satisfy the request, I will add consistent closed hi-hat hits on the offbeats (like 8th notes offbeats), which is a typical groove pattern.  
- So hi-hat will have soft closed hits (`x`) on positions 3, 7, 11, 15.  
- Keep the existing `x` hits on positions 6 and 14 as well; so overall hi-hat will nicely complement the ride.

Final hi-hat line:  
`--x-|x-x-|--x-|x-x-`

Everything else stays the same.
