The original groove has no tom hits (the T line is all dashes):

```
T: ----|----|----|----
```

The request is to keep the same placement but make the tom part more dynamic.

Since there are no tom hits at all, keeping the same placement means still no tom hits. Thus, no tom changes are possible or needed.

All other parts remain the same.
