To make the given groove double time, we essentially double the note density — playing twice as many notes per bar, so the rhythm feels twice as fast.

Original groove (quarter note feel, hits on beats 1 and 3 for kick and 2 and 4 for snare, hi-hat on beat 1 of each beat):

```
K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----  
```

**Double time approach:**

- The bar still represents 4 beats, each with 4 16th notes — so 16 16ths per bar.

- To double time, we want to make the feel twice as fast, so the kick and snare will hit twice as often, on every eighth note instead of quarter note.

- So, kick hits on beats 1, 2, 3, 4 eighth note positions (that is, at 1 e &, a — the first and third 16th notes of the first and third beats).

- Snare hits on the off beats in-between kicks in eighth notes.

- Also, hi-hat will be played on every eighth note (every 2 16th notes) to keep pace.

**Notation (with 16 16th notes, split into 4 groups of 4):**

Kicks on 1e & a of first and third beats = at 1st and 3rd 16th notes of beats 1 and 3.

Snare on 2nd and 4th beats — hitting on every 1st and 3rd 16th notes of beats 2 and 4.

Hi-hat on all 8 eighth notes (that’s every 2 16ths):
