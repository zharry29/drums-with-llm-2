The original groove has kick, snare, and closed hi-hat hits already (X and x), but no cymbal (crash or ride). The request asks for not only cymbal but also hi-hat, so I will add a cymbal part while keeping the hi-hat as is.

**Thought process:**  
- Add crash cymbal (`O`) on the downbeats to give cymbal presence without overcrowding.  
- Leave kick, snare, and hi-hat unchanged to preserve the groove.
