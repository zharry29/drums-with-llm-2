The original groove has no snare hits and only some hi-hat closed hits (‘x’, ‘X’) and ride cymbal hits. The edit request wants the groove to have not only snare but also hi-hat. Since hi-hat is already present, I will add snare hits.

**Thought process:**  
- Add snare hits (hard ‘O’) on typical backbeats, i.e., beats 2 and 4 (positions 5-8 and 13-16 in the 16th-note grid).  
- Keep hi-hat and ride parts mostly unchanged to preserve feel.  
- Kick drum stays silent as original.
