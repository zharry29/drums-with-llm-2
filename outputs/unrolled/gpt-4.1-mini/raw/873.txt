The original groove is:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

The snare (S) hits occur at the downbeats of 2 and 4 (the first character of the 2nd and 4th group, respectively):

- Downbeat 2: 5th character (first character after the first '|'), which is 'O' in the 2nd group.
- Downbeat 4: 13th character (first character after the 3rd '|'), which is 'O' in the 4th group.

The edit request is to **avoid having the snare on those downbeats**.

Solution: Remove those snare hits at those positions (replace them with '-').
