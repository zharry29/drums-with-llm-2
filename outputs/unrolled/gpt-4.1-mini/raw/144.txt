The original groove already contains some snare hits (line S has 'O' and 'o' hits). However, the edit request wants the groove to have not only hi-hat but also snare â€” so we should probably make the snare presence clearer or more prominent.

**Thought process:**  
- The snare line currently has a few soft (open/soft) hits 'o' and a hard 'O'.  
- I will add more snare hits on the backbeats (beats 2 and 4) using hard hits 'O' to emphasize snare presence.  
- Keep the kick, hi-hat, and overall pattern intact to preserve the groove feel.
