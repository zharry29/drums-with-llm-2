The request is to remove cymbal on beat 4 (positions 13-16), but keep everything else unchanged.

Cymbals are represented by:
- C: Crash cymbal (none here)
- R: Ride cymbal (present here)

Looking at beat 4 in the R (Ride cymbal) line:
- Beat 4 (positions 13-16): `o-O-` â†’ cymbal hits present, so we replace these with `----`.

Other lines remain unchanged.
