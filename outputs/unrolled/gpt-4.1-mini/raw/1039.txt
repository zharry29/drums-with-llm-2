The original snare placement is:

```
S: ----|O---|----|O---
```

Snare hits occur on:

- Beat 2: 1st 16th note — hard hit (`O`)  
- Beat 4: 1st 16th note — hard hit (`O`)

To make the same placement but more dynamic:

- Add ghost notes (soft snare) around these main hits without changing their exact positions.  
- Add soft open snare hits (`o`) or sidestick hits (`X`/`x`) to add texture.

Idea:

- Add a soft open snare hit (`o`) just after each main snare hit (2nd and 4th beat, 2nd 16th note).  
- Add a soft sidestick (`x`) on the 4th 16th note before the snare hit on the 2nd beat (1st beat of measure 2), giving a grace note before the snare.

Revised snare line:

```
S: ---x|Oo--|----|Oo--
```

Explanation:

- Beat 1, 4th 16th note: soft sidestick `x` (leading into the snare)  
- Beat 2, 1st 16th note: hard snare `O`  
- Beat 2, 2nd 16th note: soft open snare `o`  

- Beat 4, 1st 16th note: hard snare `O`  
- Beat 4, 2nd 16th note: soft open snare `o`
