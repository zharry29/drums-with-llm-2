Let's analyze the kick (K) pattern first:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
```

Breaking by beats and 16th notes:

- Beat 1 (positions 1-4): `O---` → hard hit on 1st 16th  
- Beat 2: `---o` → soft hit on 4th 16th  
- Beat 3: `O-O-` → hard hits on 1st & 3rd 16th  
- Beat 4: `----` → no hits  

---

**Request:** Keep same placement but make kick part more dynamic.

How?

- Vary hit intensity by mixing hard and soft hits, i.e. some `O` → `o` and some `o` → `O`

---

Current kick placement is dynamic already:

- Beat 1: hard hit  
- Beat 2: soft hit  
- Beat 3: two hard hits  

We can increase dynamics further by:

- Making the 3rd beat's 3rd hit soft `o` to create accents and ghost hits.

- Making the 2nd beat’s soft hit (`o`) a hard hit (`O`) for a stronger accent.

---

New kick line:

```
K: O---|---O|O-o-|----
```

Summary:

- Beat 2, 4th 16th: soft → hard (increased accent)  
- Beat 3, 3rd 16th: hard → soft (dynamic contrast)
