Let's identify the second beat and the snare line.

- The second beat's 16th notes occupy characters 5-8 (after removing '|').
- Original snare line is `----|O---|----|O---`,
- In beat 2, snare currently only hits on the first 16th note (O at position 5).

The edit request is to place a snare hit on **every 16th note** of the second beat. So all four 16ths (positions 5,6,7,8) should be snare hits.

I'll use hard hits `O` for consistency.

Updated snare line:

```
S: ----|OOOO|----|O---
```

Other lines remain unchanged.
