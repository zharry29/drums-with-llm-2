Request: reduce the number of notes, making the groove simpler.

Current groove summary:  
- Kick (K): soft hits at 2nd character of beats 1, 2, 3, and 4 (positions 2, 6, 10, 14).  
- Snare (S): sidestick hits at positions 6 and 11.  
- Hi-hat (H): soft closed hits at positions 6 and 14.  
- Ride (R): closed hits on positions 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16.

Plan:  
- Kick: reduce hits by half, keep first two only.  
- Snare: keep only one sidestick hit (beat 2).  
- Hi-hat: keep only beat 2 hit.  
- Ride: reduce to just the downbeats (positions 1, 9).
