Currently, the groove already has hi-hat playing a consistent pattern of soft closed hits ('x') on every other 16th note positions:  
`x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-`

Because the request is to add some hi-hat to the groove, and hi-hat is already present, a good way to enhance it could be:  
- Adding some open hi-hat hits ('o') on the off-beat 16th notes where the current pattern is 'â€“'  
- This adds more texture and variation.

Looking at the current hi-hat line per 4 notes:  
`x - x -`  

I will replace the dashes '-' on the off beats (positions 2,4,6,etc.) with soft open hi-hat hits 'o'.

So the new hi-hat pattern becomes:  
`xoxo|xoxo|xoxo|xoxo`
