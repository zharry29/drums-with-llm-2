The original groove has:  
- Kick hits on beat 1 downbeat, "a" of beat 2, beat 3 downbeat and "and" of beat 3.  
- Snare hits only on beats 2 and 4 downbeats.  
- Hihat open & closed hits in a fairly busy pattern on each beat.  
- Crash on beat 1 downbeat.  
- No ride or toms.

**Request:** Add some snare to the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- There are snare hits only on beats 2 and 4 downbeats (positions 5 and 13).  
- We can add some grace or ghost snare hits (soft 'o') on off-beats around beat 2 and beat 4 for added groove.  
- Positions 6 ("e" of beat 2) and 14 ("e" of beat 4) could have soft snare hits.  
- Also, adding a soft snare on the "a" of beat 3 (position 12) can add syncopation, complementing the kick hits.

Updated snare line:  
Positions:  
5: O (original)  
6: o (added)  
12: o (added)  
13: O (original)

So: ----|Oo--|---o|O---
