The groove already includes some ride cymbal playing soft and hard closed hits on the bow (‘x’ and ‘X’) in the ride line, with a pattern:

`x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-`

The edit request is to add some ride to the groove, which means enhancing or adding to the ride part.

---

**Thought process:**

- The existing ride hits are sparse with hits only on the first and middle 16th notes of each 4-note group.

- To add some ride, I will add additional soft open bell hits ('o') on the "e" and "a" subdivisions of each beat (positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16), complementing the existing closed hits. This will create a more textured ride pattern with a mix of bow and bell strikes.

- Leave the existing hard closed ride hits ('X') and soft closed hits ('x') in place at positions 1, 5, 9, 13.

Resulting ride pattern for each beat:  
1: x or X (existing)  
2: o (new)  
3: -  
4: o (new)  

Applied to all four beats:

`xoxo|Xoxo|xoxo|Xoxo`

In notation without separators:

`xoxoXoxoxoxoXoxo`
