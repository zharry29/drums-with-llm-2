The request is to remove cymbal and ride hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Cymbals include Crash (C), Hi-hat (H), and Ride (R).  
- Crash (C) line is empty—no changes needed.  
- Hi-hat (H) line is empty—no changes needed.  
- Ride (R) line is empty—no changes needed.  
- Kick (K), Snare (S), and Toms (T) remain unchanged.
