The request is to remove snare and ride cymbal hits from the groove.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Snare hits: The snare line (S) shows a hard hit `O` on the third beat of the third bar. I will replace it with `-` to remove snare.  
- Ride cymbal (R) line is already empty, so no change needed there.  
- Keep kick, hi-hat, toms, and crash as is.
