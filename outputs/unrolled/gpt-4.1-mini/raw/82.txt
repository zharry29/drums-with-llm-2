The original groove has:
- No kick or snare.
- Hi-hat with soft closed hits on two offbeats.
- No toms.
- No crash cymbal.
- Ride cymbal playing a pattern of hard and soft closed hits on the bow.

---

**Request:** Add **tom** to the existing groove that already has cymbals and ride.

---

**Thought process:**
- Introduce some tom hits to complement the existing ride and hi-hat without overcrowding.
- Add tom hits with a soft articulation (`o`) on 16th notes that don't clash with ride or hi-hat to maintain groove spacing.
- Tom hits on positions 7 and 15 (offbeats in beats 2 and 4) seem musically balanced.
