The original groove already contains kick (K) and no ride cymbal (R). The edit request asks to have not only ride but also kick. Since ride is missing, I will add a ride pattern consistent with the groove, alongside the existing kick.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the existing kick pattern intact.  
- Add ride cymbal hits (`x`) on every 8th note to complement the hi-hat and cymbal crash.  
- Fix the invalid "S" snare notation to a proper snare hit `O` on beat 3 for clarity.
