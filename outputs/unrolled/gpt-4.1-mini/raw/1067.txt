Let's analyze the Snare (S) line from the given groove:

```
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
```

- Beat 2: soft open hit on 1st 16th (`O`), soft open hit 3rd 16th (`o`); here, the first is actually a hard hit `O` and the third is soft `o`.

- Beat 3: soft open hit on 2nd 16th (`o`)

- Beat 4: hard hit on 1st 16th (`O`), soft open hit on 4th 16th (`o`)

---

**Request:** Add ghost notes on the snare.

Ghost notes are generally soft hits (`o`) played subtly between or near main hits.

---

### Plan:

- Add ghost notes (soft hits `o`) on silent snare 16th note positions that do not interfere with the main pattern.

- Add ghost notes on Beat 1 (silent in snare now) and maybe near existing hits in other beats.

---

### Implementation:

- Beat 1 (positions 1-4): all silent → add a ghost note on the 2nd 16th → `-o--`

- Beat 3 (positions 9-12): currently `-o--` at 2nd 16th → let's add one more ghost note on 4th 16th → `-o-o`

---

### New Snare line:

```
S: -o--|Oo-o|-o-o|O--o
```
