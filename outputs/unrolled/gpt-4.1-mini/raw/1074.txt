To make the drum groove funkier, generally:

- Add syncopation in the kick drum (more off-beat hits)
- Use ghost notes on the snare (soft hits between main snare hits)
- Add open or closed hi-hat variations (like alternating closed and slightly open hihats)
- Use some off-beat snare ghost notes or ghost sidesticks for groove

**Original Groove:**

```
K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----
```

---

### Plan:

- Kick drum: add additional "soft" hits (lowercase `o`) between main quarter notes for syncopation.

- Snare: leave main snare hits on 2 and 4, add ghost notes (`o`) just before main hits.

- Hi-hat: alternate closed (`x`) and open (`o`) hits on 8th-note subdivisions for a funkier texture.

---

### Implementation:

- Kick:

  - Existing hits on 1st beat in bars 1 and 3 are `O---` and `O---`

  - Add soft kicks `o` on 4th 16th note of beat 1 and 3 (for example), so beats look like `O--o` or `o--o`

- Snare:

  - Main `O` on beats 2 and 4 (positions 5 and 13 remain)

  - Add ghost `o` just before main hit, i.e. 4th 16th note of beat 1 and 3, so snare lines look like: `---o | O--- | ---o | O---`

- Hi-hat:

  - From all closed `X---`, alternate to something like `xoxo|xoxo|xoxo|xoxo` for a funky swing feel.

---

### Final groove:

K:

- Beat 1: `O--o` (hard kick on 1st 16th, soft on 4th)

- Beat 2: `----`

- Beat 3: `O--o` (same as beat 1)

- Beat 4: `----`

S:

- Beat 1: `---o` (ghost note at 4th 16th)

- Beat 2: `O---` (hard hit 1st 16th)

- Beat 3: `---o` (ghost note)

- Beat 4: `O---` (hard hit)

H:

- Repeating pattern `xoxo` per beat, so:

  - beat 1: `xoxo`

  - beat 2: `xoxo`

  - beat 3: `xoxo`

  - beat 4: `xoxo`

(That's `xoxo|xoxo|xoxo|xoxo`)
