Let's analyze the drum groove and reduce the number of notes to produce a sparser pattern.

Current groove summary:

- Kick (K): Hits at positions 1, 4, and 11.
- Snare (S): Hard and soft hits spread across beats 2, 3, and 4.
- Hi-hat (H): Hard and soft closed hits alternating every 8th note.
- Toms (T): No hits.
- Crash (C): No hits.
- Ride (R): No hits.

Plan for simplification:

- Kick: Keep just the first kick on position 1.
- Snare: Keep only the hard hit on beat 4 (position 13).
- Hi-hat: Keep only one hit per bar (position 1).
- Remove all other hits, making groove lighter but still musical.
