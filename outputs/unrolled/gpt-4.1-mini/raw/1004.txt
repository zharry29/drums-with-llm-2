The request is to:

- Play the closed hi-hat on all 8th notes (every downbeat and upbeat).
- Use open hi-hat on every upbeat.
- Keep all hits hard (accented).

Each bar has 16 sixteenth notes:

- Downbeats (quarter notes) are positions 1, 5, 9, 13.
- Upbeats (the "and" after each beat) are positions 3, 7, 11, 15.

8th notes are positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15.

Implementation for hi-hat line:

- Positions 1, 5, 9, 13: closed hi-hat (`X`)
- Positions 3, 7, 11, 15: open hi-hat (`O`)
- Other positions: `-`

Thus, the hi-hat pattern for the bar will be:

`X-O-|X-O-|X-O-|X-O-`
