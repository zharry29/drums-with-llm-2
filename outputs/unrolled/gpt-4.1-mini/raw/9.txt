The original groove has kick hits on:  
- Beat 1: 1st and 4th 16th notes (positions 1 and 4)  
- Beat 3: 3rd 16th note (position 11)  
The kick on beat 2 and 4 is silent.

The snare and hihat form a noticeable backbeat pattern and groove already.

The request is to add some kick to the groove, so I'll fill some spaces with complementary kick hits without overcrowding.

Given the groove, adding kick on the "and" (2nd 16th) of beat 2 and beat 4 could add some extra rhythmic drive.

Positions:  
- Beat 2 "and" is position 6  
- Beat 4 "and" is position 14  

Original kicks on positions 1,4,11.

I'll add kicks on 6 and 14. This stays syncopated and balanced.

New kick line:  
Positions 1 (O), 4 (O), 6 (O), 11 (O), 14 (O)  
Notation:  
- Beat 1 (positions 1-4): O--O  
- Beat 2 (5-8): -O--  
- Beat 3 (9-12): --O-  
- Beat 4 (13-16): -O--
