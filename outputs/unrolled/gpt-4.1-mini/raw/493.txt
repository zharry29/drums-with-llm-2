The original groove:

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I don't want any ride or hihat."

Step-by-step:
- Ride (R) is already silent â€” no change needed.
- Hihat (H) needs to be silenced by replacing all hits ('O', 'o', 'X', 'x') with dashes.
- Other instruments remain untouched.
- Note: 'S' in Snare line is unusual according to given notation, but will be left as is as the request doesn't ask to change it.
