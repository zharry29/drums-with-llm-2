To increase low frequency sounds, I will add more kick drum hits and add some tom hits, as both contribute to the low-end spectrum.

**Current pattern:**

- Kick: some activity (positions 2, 5-6, 11, 14-15 16th notes)

- Snare: one hit marked as `S` (which seems like a typo, should probably be `O` or `o`; I'll treat it as a snare hit on 9th 16th note)

- Hi-hat: steady closed pattern on every other 16th

- Tom: only one hard hit on 12th 16th note

- Crash: quarter note hits on 1st 16th note of every beat

---

**Plan:**

- Add more kick hits on off-beats and 16th notes near current kicks for more weight.

- Add more tom hits complementary to kicks.

- Keep snare and cymbal the same.

**Updated kick pattern:**

Add kicks on positions 1 (second 16th) and 10 (tenth 16th) to fill space.

**Updated tom pattern:**

Add a few additional tom hits on 7th and 15th 16th notes.
