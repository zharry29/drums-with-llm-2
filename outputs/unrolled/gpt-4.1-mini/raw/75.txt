The current groove consists only of:  
- Soft hi-hat closed hits (`x`) on the offbeats (positions 6 and 16).  
- Ride cymbal with mixed hard and soft closed hits (`X` and `x`) on the downbeats and some offbeats ("x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-").  
- No kick, snare, toms, or crash.  

---

**Request:** The groove should have **not only cymbal but also ride**.  
We already have ride cymbal present (`R` line), but very minimal hi-hat presence and no kick or snare to give groove.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add kick on beats 1 and 3 to establish pulse.  
- Add snare on beats 2 and 4 to reinforce backbeat.  
- Add more hi-hat hits for groove and ride coexistence: make hi-hat steady soft closed hits (`x`) on all downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13).  
- Keep existing ride part as is to complement other instruments.
