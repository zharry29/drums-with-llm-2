Let's analyze the original groove:

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

The request is to avoid having Snare hits on the downbeat of beats 2 and 4.

- The downbeat of beat 2 is the 5th sixteenth note (first character after the first '|').
- The downbeat of beat 4 is the 13th sixteenth note (first character after the third '|').
  
Now check if Snare hits exist on these positions:

- 5th character (start of 2nd beat): Snare line second group first char = `X` (hard sidestick), so there **is** a snare hit here.
- 13th character (start of 4th beat): Snare line fourth group first char = `-`, no snare hit here.

So only the downbeat of beat 2 has a snare hit.

Edit: Remove the snare hit at 5th character by changing `X` to `-`.
