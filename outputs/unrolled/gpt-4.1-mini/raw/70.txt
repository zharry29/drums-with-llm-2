The current groove has:
- Kick with hits on some beats,
- Snare with mixed open and soft hits,
- Hi-hat playing a steady pattern of hard and soft closed hits (`X-x-`),
- No ride cymbal hits at all.

---

**Request:** The groove should have **not only ride but also hi-hat**.  
Currently, the ride (`R`) line is empty, the hi-hat (`H`) has hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Hi-hat already present, so to satisfy the request, add ride cymbal hits.  
- Add ride cymbal with soft closed hits (`x`) on downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13) to provide steady ride presence without overpowering.  
- Keep all else the same.

Final ride cymbal line:  
`x---|x---|x---|x---`
