The original groove:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
```

Request: "I'd like a ride hit and kick in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Very beginning means the first 16th note.
- Kick drum (K) first character is already 'O' (hard hit), so keep it.
- Ride (R) first character is 'o' (soft open bell hit). The request is for a ride hit in the beginning â€” adding a hard ride bell hit 'O' makes sense here. Replace 'o' with 'O' at the first character.
- Other parts remain unchanged.
