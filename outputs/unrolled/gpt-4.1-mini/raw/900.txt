Let's count notes in the original groove:

- Kick (K):
  - Beat 1: O at 1st 16th
  - Beat 2: O at 1st 16th
  - Beat 3: none
  - Beat 4: O at 1st 16th  
  Total: 3 hits

- Snare (S):
  - Beat 3: O at 1st 16th  
  Total: 1 hit

- Hi-hat (H):
  - none

- Toms (T):
  - On all beats, pattern "O-o-":
    - Each beat has 2 hits (O and o), total 2 hits x 4 beats = 8 hits

Total hits: 3 (kick) + 1 (snare) + 8 (toms) = 12 hits, which is more than 8.

---

**Goal:** Reduce notes to max 8.

---

**Plan:**

- Keep kicks on beats 1 and 4 (2 hits) for foundation.
- Keep snare on beat 3 (1 hit) as backbeat.
- Reduce toms significantly to just 2 hits in the entire bar (e.g., beat 1 and beat 3 hard hits).
- Remove soft tom hits and other tom hits.
- No hi-hats or cymbals.

**New groove:**

```
K: O---|----|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|----|O---|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Counting notes:

- Kick: 2  
- Snare: 1  
- Tom: 2  
Total = 5 notes, under the maximum 8 limit, and keeps a solid groove structure.
