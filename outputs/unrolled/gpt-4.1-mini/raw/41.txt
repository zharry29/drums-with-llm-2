Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick drum has hits mostly on offbeats and syncopated 16th notes.

- Snare is only hitting once (position 9) with 'S' which is undefined in the original notation, but assuming a typo and replacing with proper notation; likely a hard snare ('O').

- Hi-hat plays soft closed hits (x) on every alternate 8th note.

- Toms have a single hard hit (O) on position 12.

- Crash plays hard hits on every first 16th note of each beat.

- No ride present.

---

**Request:** Add some ride to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**

- I'll add ride cymbal with soft closed bow hits ('x') on the off 16th notes after each downbeat (positions 2,6,10,14) to complement the rhythm and not overpower the rest.

- Also add a hard open bell hit ('O') on each downbeat (positions 1, 5, 9, 13) to give clear pulses.

- This adds a nice ride pattern accenting the groove without overcrowding.

---

Final ride line:  
Positions 1,5,9,13 = O  
Positions 2,6,10,14 = x  
Others = -

I will also fix the snare line replacing 'S' with 'O' assuming it was meant to be a hard snare hit.
