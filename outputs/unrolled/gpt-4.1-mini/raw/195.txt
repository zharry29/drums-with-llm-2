The original groove has kick, some snare hits on beats 2 and 4, crashes at the start of each beat, no hi-hat or tom hits. The request is to add toms and snare.

Since snare is already there, I will add tom hits (hard hits 'O') on some offbeats to complement the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits on offbeat 16th notes (e.g., the "e" or "a" subdivisions) to create a melodic texture without cluttering.  
- Keep snare hits on beats 2 and 4 as is.  
- Keep other parts intact.
