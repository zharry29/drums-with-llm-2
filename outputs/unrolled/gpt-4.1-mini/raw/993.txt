The request is to play the closed hi-hat on all 16th notes with accents on the quarter note downbeats.

Hi-hat notation:  
- `X` = hard closed hit (accent)  
- `x` = soft closed hit (non-accent)

There are 16 sixteenth notes per bar. The downbeats are positions 1, 5, 9, and 13. Those get `X`, while the others get `x`.

Original hi-hat line is:  
`----|x---|----|x---`

We replace all with the new pattern:  
Positions 1,5,9,13 = `X`  
All others = `x`

So the hi-hat line becomes:  
`Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx`

Other parts remain unchanged.
