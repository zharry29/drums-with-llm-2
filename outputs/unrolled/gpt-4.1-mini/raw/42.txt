The original groove currently consists of:  
- Kick hits on beat 1 and beat 3 downbeats.  
- Snare hits on beat 2 and beat 4 downbeats.  
- Hi-hat with hard closed hits on every downbeat (positions 1,5,9,13).  
- No ride cymbal.  

---

**Request:** Add some ride to the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- The ride cymbal typically adds rhythmic texture, often riding steady eighths or sixteenths in a groove.  
- To complement the current groove without clutter, I will add ride on the offbeats (the "and" of each beat) with soft closed bow hits 'x' at positions 3,7,11,15.  
- On downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13), I will add medium-intensity ride hits with hard closed bow hits 'X' to contrast the hi-hat.  
- This way, ride and hi-hat alternate and create a driving pattern.

Resulting ride line:  
Positions 1,5,9,13: X  
Positions 3,7,11,15: x  
Others: -
