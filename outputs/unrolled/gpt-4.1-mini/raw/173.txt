The original groove has no tom or cymbal hits â€” only some closed hi-hat and ride cymbal hits. The request asks for the groove to have toms and cymbals.

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits (hard hits 'O') in some interesting rhythmic spots.  
- Add some crash cymbal hits ('O') on the crash line as cymbal presence.  
- Preserve the existing hi-hat and ride rhythms.
