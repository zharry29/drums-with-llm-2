The original groove consists only of hi-hat (soft closed hits ‘x’) and ride cymbal (soft and hard closed hits ‘x’ and ‘X’), with no kick, snare, toms, or crash present. The request is to add snare so the groove has both cymbal and snare.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add snare hits on standard backbeats (beats 2 and 4).  
- Keep the existing ride and hi-hat pattern as is for texture.  
- Leave kick and toms silent as not requested.
