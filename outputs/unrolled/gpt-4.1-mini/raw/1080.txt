The given hi-hat line is silent:

```
H: ----|----|----|----
```

---

**Request:** Add a more varied hi-hat pattern.

---

### Thought process:

- Incorporate both closed (`x` and `X`) and open (`o` and `O`) hi-hat hits for texture.

- Use syncopation and mix 16th and 8th note positions.

- Complement the ride cymbal rhythm which is soft open on the bell (`o`) and hard open (`O`) â€” a steady triplet-like pulse.

- For a funky lively feel, try a pattern such as: `xoxo` on beat 1, then introduce skips and rests to contrast.

---

### Proposed hi-hat pattern (per beat of four 16ths):

- Beat 1: `x-o-` (soft closed, rest, soft open, rest)

- Beat 2: `-xox` (rest, soft closed, soft open, soft closed)

- Beat 3: `xo-x` (soft closed, soft open, rest, soft closed)

- Beat 4: `x---` (soft closed on first 16th)

---

### Final hi-hat line:

```
H: x-o-| -xox|xo-x|x---
```
Removing extra space for notation correctness:

```
H: x-o-|-xox|xo-x|x---
```

### Final groove:
