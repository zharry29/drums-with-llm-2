Let's first count the number of notes in the original groove:

- Kick (K):  
  o (beat1, 1st sixteenth), o (beat2, 3rd sixteenth), o (beat3, 1st sixteenth), o (beat4, 3rd sixteenth)  
  = 4 hits

- Snare (S):  
  X (beat2, 1st sixteenth), X (beat3, 3rd sixteenth)  
  = 2 hits

- Hi-hat (H):  
  x (beat2, 1st sixteenth), x (beat4, 3rd sixteenth)  
  = 2 hits

- Ride (R):  
  x (beat1, 1st sixteenth), X (beat2, 1st sixteenth), x (beat2, 3rd sixteenth), x (beat3, 1st sixteenth), X (beat4, 1st sixteenth), x (beat4, 3rd sixteenth)  
  = 6 hits

Total notes = 4 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 14 notes, too many.

---

**Goal:** Reduce notes to no more than 8 total.

**Approach:**  
- Keep some kick hits — reduce to 2.  
- Keep snare hits — reduce to 1.  
- Keep hi-hat hits — reduce to 1 or 2.  
- Ride — reduce to 2 hits.  

---

**Edited groove:**

- Kick on beat 1 and beat 3 (soft hits)  
- Snare on beat 3 (sidestick hard hit)  
- Hi-hat one soft closed hit on beat 4  
- Ride one hard closed hit on beat 2 and on beat 4 first sixteenth
