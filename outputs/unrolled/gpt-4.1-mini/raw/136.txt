The original groove has kick, sidestick snare, closed hi-hat hits, and ride cymbal, but no toms. The request is to add not only tom but also hi-hat (hi-hat is already present, so just add toms).

**Thought process:**  
- Keep existing parts as is to preserve the groove feel.  
- Add some subtle tom hits to bring toms into the groove.  
- Maintain ride cymbal and hi-hat patterns.
