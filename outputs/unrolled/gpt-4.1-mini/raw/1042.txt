Let's analyze the original snare hits and their placements:

```
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
```

Breakdown by beat (each four characters per beat):

- Beat 1: `----` no hits  
- Beat 2: `Oo-o`  
  - 1st 16th: O (hard hit)  
  - 2nd 16th: o (soft open)  
  - 3rd 16th: - (rest)  
  - 4th 16th: o (soft open)  
- Beat 3: `-o--`  
  - 1st 16th: - (rest)  
  - 2nd 16th: o (soft open)  
  - 3rd 16th: - (rest)  
  - 4th 16th: - (rest)  
- Beat 4: `O--o`  
  - 1st 16th: O (hard hit)  
  - 2nd 16th: - (rest)  
  - 3rd 16th: - (rest)  
  - 4th 16th: o (soft open)

**Goal**: Make this snare pattern more dynamic but keep the same placement (i.e., hits stay at the same 16th-note positions).

**Approach**:

- Add sidestick hits (X or x) in some positions where there's room to increase dynamics.  
- Exchange some soft open hits (o) for soft sidestick hits (x) or hard sidestick hits (X) to add contrast.  
- Keep the hard hits (O) in place.

**Proposed snare edits**:

- Beat 2: Change 2nd 16th `o` to `x` (soft sidestick), and 4th 16th `o` stays as is to retain variation.  
- Beat 3: Change 2nd 16th `o` to `x` to give a softer side vibe.  
- Beat 4: Change 4th 16th `o` to `x` for consistency.

**Revised snare line**:

```
S: ----|Ox-o|-x--|O--x
