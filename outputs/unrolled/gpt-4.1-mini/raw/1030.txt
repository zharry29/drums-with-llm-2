The original cymbal line is:

```
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
```

There is a hard crash cymbal hit (`O`) on the first 16th note of every beat (beat 1, 2, 3, and 4).

To keep the same placement but make the cymbal hits more dynamic, I can alternate between hard (`O`) and soft (`o`) hits on the crash, and possibly add a soft open ride cymbal hit (`o`) right after some crashes for textural dynamics, without changing the placement of the original cymbal hits.

Here's a suggestion for each beat:

- Beat 1: `O---` → `Oo--` (hard crash plus soft crash right after)  
- Beat 2: `O---` → `oO--` (soft crash followed by hard crash)  
- Beat 3: `O---` → `Oo--`  
- Beat 4: `O---` → `oO--`

Updated cymbal line:

```
C: Oo--|oO--|Oo--|oO--
```

This keeps the crash hits on the first 16th note of each beat, adding dynamic expression with alternating volumes and layering.
