The original groove has kick, snare, and strong closed hi-hat hits but no toms. The request is to add toms while keeping the hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kick, snare, and hi-hat pattern intact to preserve groove feel.  
- Add tom hits to complement the groove, placing them on offbeats or between snare and kick hits to add rhythmic interest.  
- Use a soft tom hit (`o`) to not overpower the groove, with one or two hard hits (`O`) for accents.
