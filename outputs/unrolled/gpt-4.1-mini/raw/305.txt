The original groove has kick, snare, toms, but no ride cymbal. The request asks to have **not only ride but also snare**.

Since snare is already there (hard snare hit `O` on beat 3 of the third bar), I should now add a ride pattern to complement the groove.

**Thought process:**

- Keep kick, snare, and tom patterns as is.  
- Add a ride cymbal (closed hits `x`) playing steady 8th notes for rhythmic consistency and texture.
