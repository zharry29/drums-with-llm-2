The original groove has kick, snare, and hi-hat but no toms.

Request: add tom to the groove alongside the kick.

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits in places that complement the groove but donâ€™t overcrowd it.  
- Placing tom hits on some off-beat 16th notes or on the "and" of beats can add nice rhythmic interest.  
- Keep kick, snare, hi-hat unchanged to preserve original groove feel.
