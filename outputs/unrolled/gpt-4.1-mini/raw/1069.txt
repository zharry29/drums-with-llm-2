Let's analyze the original snare (S) line:

```
S: ----|O---|----|O---
```

The snare hits are on the 1st 16th note of beats 2 and 4, both hard hits (`O`).

---

**Request:** Add ghost notes on the snare.

Ghost notes are soft snare hits, usually represented by `o` (soft open hit) or `x` (soft sidestick). Typically, they are placed on the off-beats or 16th notes near the main snare hits to add subtle rhythmic texture.

---

### Plan:

- Keep the main snare hits on beats 2 and 4, 1st 16th note.

- Add ghost notes on some adjacent 16th notes, for example the 3rd or 4th 16th notes in beats 2 and 4, where there's currently silence.

---

### Implementation:

- Beat 2: add a ghost note `o` on the 3rd 16th note → `O-o-`

- Beat 4: add a ghost note `o` on the 4th 16th note → `O--o`

---

### New snare line:

```
S: ----|O-o-|----|O--o
```
