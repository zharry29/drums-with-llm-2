The original groove has:  
- Kick on beats 1, 2, and 4 downbeats.  
- Snare on beat 3 downbeat.  
- Toms playing a consistent pattern with soft and hard hits every beat.  
- No hihat, crash, or ride present.

**Request:** Add some ride to the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- Adding ride cymbal to complement the groove, typically ride rides steady on the downbeats or eighth notes.  
- To keep it simple, I'll add the ride with hard closed hits (X) or soft closed hits (x) on every offbeat (the "and" of each beat, positions 3, 7, 11, 15) to interplay with the tom hits.  
- Also add a hard bell hit (O) on each downbeat (positions 1, 5, 9, 13) for clear pulse.
