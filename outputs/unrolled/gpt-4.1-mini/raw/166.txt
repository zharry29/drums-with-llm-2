The original groove contains soft kick hits ('o') spread throughout, sidestick snare hits ('X') on the snare line, and some closed hi-hat and ride cymbal hits. However, the kick hits are mostly soft and relatively sparse, and the snare hits are only sidesticks (softer articulation). The request is to make sure the groove has not only kick but also snare, implying the snare presence could be stronger and the kick more defined.

**Thought process:**

- Add a couple of stronger kick hits ('O') on beats 1 and 3 to make the kick more audible and driving.  
- Replace or supplement soft sidestick snare hits ('X') with a hard snare hit ('O') on beat 2 and/or 4 to bring out the snare more explicitly.  
- Keep the closed hi-hat and ride pattern as is to maintain groove feel.
