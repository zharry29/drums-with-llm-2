The request is to remove cymbal and ride hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Kick (K) and Snare (S) lines are not cymbals or ride, so remain unchanged.  
- Hi-hat (H) contains soft closed hits (`x`), which are cymbals, so replace with `-`.  
- Crash (C) is empty.  
- Ride (R) contains various closed hits (`x` and `X`), so replace all with `-`.
