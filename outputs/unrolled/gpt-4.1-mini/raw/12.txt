The current groove kick pattern is:  
- Beat 1: kick on downbeat (position 1)  
- Beat 2: soft kick on "e" (position 6)  
- Beat 3: kicks on downbeat and "and" (positions 9 and 11)  
- Beat 4: no kick hits  

The rest of the rhythm is quite active with snare and hihat.  

**Request:** Add some kick to the groove.

**Thought process:**  
To add more drive and fullness without clutter, I will:  
- Add a kick on beat 4 downbeat (position 13) to fill that gap.  
- Add a kick on the "and" of beat 2 (position 8) to complement the existing soft kick on "e" (position 6).  
- Possibly soften the new kick hits for dynamic balance.

Positions 8 and 13 will get soft kicks (o).

This results in kick hits at: 1 (O), 6 (o), 8 (o), 9 (O), 11 (O), 13 (o).
