The original groove contains kick hits, hi-hat patterns, crash cymbals on each downbeat, and a tom hit on the 3rd beat (last 16th note). However, the snare line contains an invalid character 'S', which should be replaced by a proper snare articulation or removed.

The request is for the groove to have not only snare but also tom. Since the snare is missing valid hits, I'll replace 'S' with a hard snare hit 'O' and ensure tom hits remain as they are or are slightly enhanced for more presence.

**Thought process:**  
- Replace the invalid 'S' in snare line with 'O' (hard snare hit) on the 3rd beat first 16th note to define the snare sound.  
- Keep the tom hit on the 3rd beat last 16th note (hard hit 'O').  
- Optionally add another tom hit to balance the groove.  
- Keep all other parts unchanged.
