The original groove currently has a ride pattern with soft and hard open bell hits: `o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-` on every beat. 

The edit request is to add some ride to the groove; since ride is already present, I interpret this as enhancing or adding more ride cymbal hits to enrich the groove.

**Thought process:**

- The ride line currently has notes on positions 1, 2, and 3 of every beat group, specifically soft open bell (o), hard open bell (O), then a dash.

- To add more ride, I can introduce some ride hits on the 16th notes right after the existing hits for a busy but still groovy pattern.

- Let's add soft closed hits (`x`) in the 4th 16th note of each beat group (positions 4, 8, 12, 16), complementing the existing ride hits.

This creates a fuller ride pattern without cluttering.

New ride pattern:

Positions 1: o  
Positions 2: -  
Positions 3: O  
Positions 4: x  

Repeated for every beat:

`o-Ox|o-Ox|o-Ox|o-Ox`
