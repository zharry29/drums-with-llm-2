The original groove currently has:

- Kick on soft hits (o) on beats 1 and the "and" of beats 2 and 4.

- Snare has only sidestick hits (X) sparsely on some offbeats.

- Hihat has soft closed hits (x) on the "and" of beats 2 and 4.

- Ride cymbal has soft and hard closed hits on the bow alternating.

- No toms or crash.

---

**Request:** Add some snare to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The snares here are sidesticks, quite sparse. Adding regular snare hits (O for hard or o for soft) can give more body.

- To complement the groove and keep subtlety, add soft snare hits 'o' on beats 2 and 4 downbeats (positions 5 and 13).

- Keep the sidesticks on offbeats intact.

Updated snare line:

Positions 5 and 13 set to 'o'. Other sidesticks positions remain.

So:

Original snare: ----|X---|--X-|----

Positions:

1-4|5-8|9-12|13-16

- - - - | X - - - | - - X - | - - - -

Update:

S: ----|o---|--X-|o---
