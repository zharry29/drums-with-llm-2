The request is to remove snare on beat 4 (positions 13-16) but leave everything else unchanged.

Looking at the snare line (S) on beat 4:

- Beat 4: `O---` â†’ there is a hard snare hit on the first 16th note of beat 4, so this should be removed by replacing the 4 characters of beat 4 with `----`.

All other lines remain unchanged.
