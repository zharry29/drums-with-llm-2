The original groove has kick, snare sidesticks, some hi-hat hits, and a ride pattern. The request asks for the groove to have not only ride but also kick. Kick is already present, but it’s very sparse (only soft hits on some 16ths). To highlight the kick more combined with ride, I’ll add some harder kick hits for presence, keeping the overall feel.

**Thought process:**  
- Add more kick hits (hard `O` or soft `o`) on beats where appropriate to give stronger presence.  
- Keep snare sidesticks and hi-hat hits as is for subtle texture.  
- Keep the ride cymbal pattern intact.
