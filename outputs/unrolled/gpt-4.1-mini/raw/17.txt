The original groove has soft kick hits on:  
- Beat 1: position 1 (o)  
- Beat 2: position 6 (o)  
- Beat 3: position 9 (o)  
- Beat 4: position 14 (o)  

Snare and hihat play sidesticks on some offbeats, ride cymbal plays 8ths with variation.

**Request:** Add some kick to the groove.

**Thought process:**  
The groove currently has soft kicks spaced fairly widely. To add more drive and presence, I will add a few hard kicks (O) on positions complementary to the existing kicks:  
- Add hard kicks on the "and" of beat 1 (pos 3)  
- Beat 2 upbeat "a" (pos 8)  
- Beat 4 downbeat (pos 13)  

This creates a dynamic, syncopated feel while preserving softness from existing kicks.

New kick hits positions:  
1 (o), 3 (O), 6 (o), 8 (O), 9 (o), 13 (O), 14 (o)  

Kick line: o O o O o O o

Positions broken into 4 groups of 4:  
Beat1: o--o  
Beat2: --o- (but we add O on 8 â†’ - at pos5, pos6 o, pos7 -, pos8 O) so it's -o-O  
Beat3: o---  
Beat4: O-o- (pos13 O, pos14 o)

Final kick line:

K: o-o-| -o-O|o---|O-o-

I will not change other lines.
