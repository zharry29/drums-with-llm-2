The original groove has kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash but no ride. The request is to add ride along with the kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add a ride cymbal pattern using closed ride hits (`x`) to complement the hi-hat and maintain rhythmic flow.  
- Place ride hits on eighth notes (every 2nd and 4th 16th note in each beat) for a steady pulse.  
- Keep kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash unchanged.
