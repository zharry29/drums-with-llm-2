To displace the first snare backbeat by delaying it an 8th note, we move the first snare hit from beat 2 (the 5th 16th note) to the "and" of 2 (the 7th 16th note). The second snare hit remains as is on beat 4.

**Original snare hits:**

- Beat 2: 5th 16th note (`O`, index 4 counting from 0)

- Beat 4: 13th 16th note (`O`, index 12)

**After displacement:**

- Move first snare hit 2 16th notes later, to the 7th 16th note (index 6).

- Second snare hit remains at 13th 16th note.

Keep kick and hi-hat unchanged.
