The original groove has kicks, snares, and crashes, but no hi-hat hits. The request is that the groove should have not only hi-hat but also cymbal. Since the cymbal (crash) is already present, the missing element is hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add a steady hi-hat closed pattern (‘x’) to complement the existing cymbal crashes.  
- Keep the rest of the groove intact to preserve original feel.
