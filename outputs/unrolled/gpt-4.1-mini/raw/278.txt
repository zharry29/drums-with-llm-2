The original groove has kick and crash cymbals, but no ride cymbal. The edit request calls for the groove to have not only ride but also kick. Since kick is already present, I'll add a ride cymbal pattern while keeping the kick as is.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the kick pattern intact.  
- Keep the crash cymbal on downbeats.  
- Add ride cymbal closed hits (`x`) on steady 8th notes for consistent ride presence.  
- Leave other parts as they are.
