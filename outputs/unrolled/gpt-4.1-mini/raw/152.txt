The original groove has kick (K), snare (S) on beat 3, and toms (T) with a cycle of hard and soft hits. There's no hi-hat (H) in the original groove.

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only hi-hat but also snare.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add hi-hat pattern, e.g., soft closed hits 'x' on eighth notes to complement the groove.  
- Keep existing snare hits as is.  
- Preserve kick and tom patterns.  
- No crash or ride requested, so leave those empty.
