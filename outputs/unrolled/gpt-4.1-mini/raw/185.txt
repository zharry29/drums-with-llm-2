The original groove includes kick, snare, and hi-hat but no ride or tom hits. The edit request asks to add both ride and tom elements.

**Thought process:**  
- Add some ride cymbal hits to maintain a steady pulse or accent. Since the hi-hat is already detailed with closed hits (X/x), the ride can complement that without overcrowding by placing hits on the bow ('x' or 'X').  
- Incorporate tom hits in the groove, ideally in spaces that add dynamics and variety without interfering with kick and snare accents.
