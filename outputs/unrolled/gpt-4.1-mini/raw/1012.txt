The original groove has no tom hits (T line is all silent):

```
T: ----|----|----|----
```

The request is to keep the same tom placement (which means no tom hits) but make it more dynamic.

Since there are no tom hits, the only way to interpret "more dynamic" with the same placement is to keep it silent (no hits at all).

No changes necessary or possible on toms.
