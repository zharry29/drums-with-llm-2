The original kick pattern is quite dense, already hitting frequently:  
- Beat 1: positions 1, 2, 3 (hard kicks `O` at positions 1-3)  
- Beat 2: position 6 (hard kick)  
- Beat 3: positions 9, 10, 11 (3 hits)  
- Beat 4: positions 14, 15, 16 (3 hits)

The request is to fill the whole bar with double kick â€” two kick hits per beat, ideally at 1st and 3rd 16th notes of each beat (positions 1 & 3, 5 & 7, 9 & 11, 13 & 15).

I will convert the kick line to have exactly two hard kicks per beat placed accordingly.

Other instruments (S, C) remain unchanged.
