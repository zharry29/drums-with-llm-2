To add more low frequency sounds, the best approach is to increase kick drum presence and incorporate tom hits. The original groove's kick is fairly active but can be reinforced further in the offbeats or 16th notes for thicker low end. Toms can add mid-low frequency weight as well.

**Plan:**

- Add extra kick hits in some offbeat 16th notes for weight and drive.

- Add tom hits on some offbeat 16th notes to complement kick and add low mids.

**Execution:**

- Kicks: Add kicks on the 4th 16th of the second beat and on the last 16th of the third beat.

- Toms: Add tom hits on the last 16th of the first and fourth beats for accent.
