The given groove already has tom hits (hard 'O' on T line in bar 3) and crash cymbal hits (hard 'O' on the C line every bar). The kick pattern is active, but the snare line has an 'S' which is not defined in the notation instructions (likely a typo or invalid character).

The edit request says the groove should have tom and cymbal, which it already does, but since there's an unrecognized snare character and to polish the groove, I'll adjust the snare to valid notation and slightly enhance cymbal presence if needed.

**Thought process:**  
- Replace the invalid 'S' on snare line with a valid snare articulation, for example, hard snare hit 'O' or sidestick hit 'X' as appropriate.  
- Cymbal is already present with crash hits every bar.  
- Tom hit is present on bar 3.  
- Keep kick, hi-hat, tom, and crash as is for groove feel.
