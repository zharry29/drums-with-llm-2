The original groove has soft kick (`o`) hits on some notes, sidestick snare hits (`X` and `x`), and hi-hat and ride cymbal closed hits.

The request is that the groove should have not only snare but also kick, so the kicks need to be somewhat more prominent or frequent.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Currently, kicks are soft and sparse: `o---|--o-|o---|--o-`.  
- I will add a couple of extra soft kick hits to increase presence without overpowering the groove.  
- Keep the snare sidesticks and cymbals as is.
