The original groove:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a cymbal hit and hihat in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning refers to the first 16th note.
- Cymbals can be Crash (C) or Ride (R).
- At the very beginning:
  - Crash (C) first character is 'O' (hard hit), so cymbal hit is already present.
  - Hihat (H) first character is '-', so add a hard closed hit 'X' or soft closed hit 'x'.
  - The existing groove uses 'o' and 'O' for open hits, but 'X' or 'x' are closed hits and commonly used on the 16th note for more definition.
  - I'll add a soft closed hit 'x' to blend well.
