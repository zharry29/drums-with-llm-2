The original groove has kick and snare hits on beats 1 and 3 (kick) and beats 2 and 4 (snare), plus consistent closed hi-hat hits (‘X’) on the downbeats—but no tom hits.

The request is to add toms alongside the kick.

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits that complement the groove without overwhelming it.  
- Placing tom hits on offbeat 16th notes or in between kicks and snares works well.  
- Use hard tom hits ‘O’ to make them clear.  
- Keep existing kick, snare, and hi-hat patterns unchanged.
