The request is to reduce the number of notes in the groove, simplifying it while keeping the general rhythm and feel.

Current groove summary:  
- Kick: hits on beat 1 (twice per bar on first two beats) and beat 4.  
- Snare: one hit on beat 3, strong hard hit.  
- Hihat: silent.  
- Toms: played every beat (with alternating hard and soft hits) on all four beats.  
- Crash and Ride: silent.

To simplify:  
- Reduce tom hits: Maybe only on beats 1 and 3 to keep some flavor but less busy.  
- Kick: Keep only main beats, maybe first and fourth beat.  
- Snare: Keep as is, one hit on beat 3.

Adjusted groove plan:  
- Kick: keep 1st and 4th beats.  
- Snare: keep 3rd beat hit.  
- Toms: hits only on 1st and 3rd beat hard hits, remove soft hits and remove beats 2 and 4.  
- Other instruments stay silent.
