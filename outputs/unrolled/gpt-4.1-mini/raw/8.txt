Examining the original groove:

- Kick drum: hits scattered predominantly on beats 1 and 2 and the "and" of beats 3 and 4.

- Snare: a single soft snare hit (S) on the downbeat of beat 3.

- Hihat: steady pattern of alternating hard and soft closed hits on every 8th note.

- Toms: one hard tom hit on the "a" of beat 3 (4th 16th of beat 3) â€“ position 12.

- Crash cymbal: hits on the downbeat of every beat.

- Ride: silent.

---

Request: Add some tom to the groove.

---

Thoughts:

- There is already one tom hit on position 12.

- Additional tom hits will nicely fill in empty spaces around the kick drum to enhance the groove.

- Adding soft tom hits on the "e" of beat 1 (position 2) and the "a" of beat 2 (position 8) will add rhythmic variation.

- Adding a hard tom hit on the "e" of beat 4 (position 14) will provide a nice accent before the kick hits on the "and" of beat 4.

Mapping positions (1-16):

- Beat 1: positions 1-4

- Beat 2: 5-8

- Beat 3: 9-12

- Beat 4: 13-16

---

Tom hits:

- position 2 (beat 1 "e"): o (soft)

- position 8 (beat 2 "a"): o (soft)

- position 12 (beat 3 "a"): O (hard) (already there)

- position 14 (beat 4 "e"): O (hard)

Writing the tom line:

Positions 2 and 8: o

Position 12 and 14: O

So:

T: -o--|---o|---O|-O--
