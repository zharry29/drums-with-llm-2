The original groove has kick, snare, and closed hi-hat hits but no ride. The request is to add ride along with the kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add a ride pattern using closed ride hits (`x`) to complement the existing hi-hat rhythm.  
- Add ride hits on eighth notes to keep a steady pulse.  
- Keep kick, snare, and hi-hat as is.
