The original groove contains kick, snare (with an invalid 'S' notation but likely a snare hit), hi-hat, toms, and crash, but no ride cymbal. The hi-hat is already present as closed hits (x), and tom hits occur mid-bar. The request is to have not only tom but also hi-hat, so the hi-hat is already there. The invalid 'S' should be corrected to a proper snare hit 'O'.

**Thought process:**  
- Correct the snare hit 'S' to 'O'.  
- Keep existing tom and hi-hat parts as requested.  
- Retain crash cymbal hits as is.  
- No ride cymbal requested, so leave it empty.
