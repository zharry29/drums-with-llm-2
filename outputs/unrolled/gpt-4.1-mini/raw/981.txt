The request is to reduce the number of notes for a simpler groove while keeping the general rhythmic feel.

Current groove highlights:

- Kick (K): Hits on positions 1,4,11.
- Snare (S): Mixture of hard and soft hits spread over beats 2,3,4.
- Hi-hat (H): Silent.
- Toms (T): Silent.
- Crash (C): Silent.
- Ride (R): Soft and hard open hits alternating on every beat.

Plan to simplify:

- Kick: Keep only the 1st hard hit on position 1, remove the other hits.
- Snare: Keep just a simple hard hit on beat 4 (position 13).
- Ride: Keep every other hit, reducing some to soften the pattern.
- Remove all other hits.
