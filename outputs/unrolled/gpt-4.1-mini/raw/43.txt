The original groove already has a ride pattern on the R line as follows:  
Positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15 contain soft and hard closed bow hits (x and X) alternating.  

The request is "Add some ride to the groove." Since ride exists but at a fairly light level, I will add some ride cymbal hits with harder bell hits (‘O’) on the downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13) to introduce accentuation while keeping the existing closed bow hits.

---

**Plan:**  
- Add hard open bell hits ('O') on the downbeat 16th notes  
- Keep the existing pattern with soft and hard closed bow hits (x, X) at offbeats.  
- This will create a fuller, more dynamic ride pattern.

---

Final ride pattern per beat (4 sixteenth notes):  
"Ox-x" repeated four times gives: O (bell downbeat), x (soft), - (skip), x (soft/hard alternating) — Since the original had a pattern "x---" and "X-x-", I will standardize to "Ox-x" per beat, balancing accents and movement.
