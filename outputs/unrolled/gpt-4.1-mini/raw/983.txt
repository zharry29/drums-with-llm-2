The request is to fill the whole bar with a double kick pattern while keeping the rest of the groove intact (snare, hi-hat, etc.) or unchanged unless instructed otherwise.

Double kick typically means two kick hits in quick succession, often on 16th notes.

The original Kick pattern is:  
`O--O|----|--O-|----`

Positions with kick hits:  
- Beat 1: positions 1 and 4  
- Beat 3: position 11

To fill the whole bar with double kick, I'll place two kick hits per beat, ideally on the 1st and 3rd 16th notes of each beat (positions 1 & 3, 5 & 7, 9 & 11, 13 & 15).

I'll use hard kicks (`O`) for all these hits.

The other instruments (S, H) will be left unchanged as per the original groove.
