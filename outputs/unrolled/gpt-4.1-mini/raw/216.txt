The original groove has kick and toms, no hi-hat or cymbal, and snare only on the third beat (O---). The request is for the groove to have both cymbal and snare.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Currently, no cymbal present; add crash cymbal hits ('O') on the downbeat of the first and third bars for accents.  
- The snare is present only on beat 3 (third bar), we can add snare backbeat on beats 2 and 4 for a more typical groove.  
- Leave kick and toms as is.
