The original groove has only ride cymbal and hi-hat closed hits, but no toms.

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only tom but also ride.

---

**Thought process:**

- Keep the existing ride cymbal line as is.  
- Add some tom hits to incorporate toms into the groove.  
- Keep hi-hat and other instruments unchanged.
