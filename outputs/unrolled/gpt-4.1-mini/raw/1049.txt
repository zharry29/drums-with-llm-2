The original ride line is completely silent:

```
R: ----|----|----|----
```

The request is to keep the **same placement** of ride but make it **more dynamic**.

Since there are no ride hits currently, the only way to keep the same placement is to keep it silent.

Therefore, the ride line remains unchanged.
