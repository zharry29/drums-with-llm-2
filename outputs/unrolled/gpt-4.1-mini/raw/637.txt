The original groove:

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

Request: "I'd like a kick hit and ride in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Kick drum (K) first character is "o" (soft hit). Since the request is for a kick hit, I'll upgrade it to a hard kick "O" to make it clearer.
- Ride cymbal (R) first character is "x" (soft closed bow hit), so a ride is present, but the request implies emphasizing it, so I will upgrade this to a hard closed hit "X".
- Leave all other parts unchanged.
