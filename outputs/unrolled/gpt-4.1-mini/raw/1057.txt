Let's analyze the kick (K) pattern first:

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
```

Breaking down:

- Bar 1, beat 1 (positions 1-4): kick on 1st 16th, soft hit `o`  
- Bar 1, beat 2: kick on 3rd 16th, soft hit `o`  
- Bar 1, beat 3: kick on 1st 16th, soft hit `o`  
- Bar 1, beat 4: kick on 3rd 16th, soft hit `o`

---

**Goal:** Keep same placement but make the kick more dynamic.

How to add dynamics without changing placement?

- Change some soft kicks `o` to hard kicks `O` on some notes  
- Add some slight variation in velocity between hits

---

### Proposal:

- Make the 1st beat kick hard `O` (accent) to bring energy  
- Keep 3rd 16th notes soft `o` to create a dynamic contrast  
- On beat 3, first 16th hard `O` accent again  
- On beat 4, 3rd 16th soft `o`

So the new kick line:

```
K: O---|--o-|O---|--o-
```
