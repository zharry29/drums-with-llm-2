The original groove features kick, an unknown "S" on snare line (which is likely a typo or placeholder), hi-hat closed hits, toms, and crash cymbal. There's no snare clearly written and no ride cymbal. The edit request wants the groove to have **not only snare but also cymbal**.

To satisfy this:  
- Replace "S" with a proper snare hit `O` on the snare line to make snare present.  
- Keep the existing crash cymbal hits as cymbal presence.  
- Optionally add ride cymbal for extra cymbal texture if desired, but since crash is present, that suffices.  
- Keep kick, hi-hat, and toms as they are.
