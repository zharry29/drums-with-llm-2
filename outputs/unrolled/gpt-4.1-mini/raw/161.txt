The original groove includes kicks ('O' and 'o') in several positions already, with a varied rhythm on the kick drum line. The cymbals are present on the hi-hat (H) line in the form of closed and open sidesticks as 'X' and 'x'. The request is to ensure the groove has not only cymbal but also kick.

**Thought process:**  
- The kick pattern is there but somewhat sparse and spaced.  
- To emphasize the kick presence more, I will add a couple of additional stronger kicks 'O' to reinforce the pulse without losing the grooveâ€™s character.  
- Keep snare and hi-hat patterns as they are to preserve the groove feel.
