The current groove has:  
- Kick drum pattern with some hard hits.  
- Snare with a mix of hard and open soft hits.  
- Hi-hat playing a steady pattern of closed hard and soft hits (`X` and `x`).  
- No ride cymbal hits at all.

---

**Request:** The groove should have **not only cymbal but also ride**.  
Currently, only cymbal present is hi-hat; ride cymbal is absent.

---

**Thought process:**  
- I will add a ride cymbal pattern with soft closed hits (`x`) on the downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13), providing a steady ride rhythm complementing the hi-hat.  
- Keep all other parts unchanged to retain the feel.
