The original groove has kick, snare, and crash cymbal but no ride or hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The request is to include the ride cymbal along with the kick.  
- Add a ride pattern with consistent closed ride hits (`x`) on 8th notes to support the groove rhythmically without overwhelming.  
- Keep kick, snare, and crash parts intact.
