The current groove has:  
- Kick drum (K) with dense hits on beat 1 and 3 bars.  
- Snare (S) hits on beats 6 and 14 (positions 6 and 14 in the bar).  
- Crash cymbal (C) on every downbeat (positions 1, 5, 9, 13).  
- No hi-hat (H) or ride cymbal (R) hits.  

---

**Request:** Groove should have **not only ride but also hi-hat**.  
Currently, no ride or hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add a ride cymbal pattern to meet the ride requirement: use closed soft bow hits `x` on positions 1, 5, 9, 13 for a steady pulse supporting the kick and crash.  
- Add a hi-hat pattern with soft closed hits `x` on offbeats (positions 3, 7, 11, 15) to complement the ride and provide groove.  
- No changes to kick, snare, or crash.
