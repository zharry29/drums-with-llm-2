The request is to drop out everything in the second beat (positions 5-8).

Let's analyze the original groove's second beat in each line:

- K: second beat is `O---` → replace with `----`
- S: second beat is `----` → already silent
- H: second beat is `----` → already silent
- T: second beat is `O-o-` → replace with `----`
- C: second beat is `----` → already silent
- R: second beat is `----` → already silent
