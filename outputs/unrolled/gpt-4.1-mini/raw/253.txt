The original groove already has kick and ride parts â€” the ride is played on every beat with a pattern of soft and hard bell hits (`o-O-`). The request is for not only kick but also ride, so the ride part is fine.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Since ride is already present, I will emphasize it slightly by adding some ride closed hits (`x`) between the bell hits to add texture.  
- Keep the kick and snare parts unchanged.  
- Keep other parts (hi-hat, tom, crash) silent as per the original.
