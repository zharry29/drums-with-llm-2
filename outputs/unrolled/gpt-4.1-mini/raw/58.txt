The groove currently has:  
- Kick on beat 1 of each bar segment, except no kick on the third beat (bar 3, first 4 sixteenths).  
- Snare plays on the third beat downbeat (beat 3).  
- Toms playing a repeating pattern every beat.  
- No cymbals present.

---

**Request:** Add cymbal to the groove, so it includes both kick and cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The groove has toms prominently, so adding crash cymbals on downbeats 1 and 3 (positions 1 and 9) will accentuate those crucial moments.  
- Use hard crash `O`.
