The original groove has kick, snare on beats 2 and 4, and hard closed hi-hat ('X') hits on the first 16th note of each beat. There is no cymbal present.

The request is for the groove to have not only cymbal but also snare, so cymbal is missing here.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add crash cymbal hits ('O') on the downbeats (first 16th note of beats 1 and 3) to provide cymbal presence.  
- Keep snare hits as is.  
- Leave kick and hi-hat as is.
