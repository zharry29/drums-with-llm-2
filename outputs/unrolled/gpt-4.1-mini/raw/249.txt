The original groove contains kick, snare, and ride cymbal but no hi-hat or tom hits.

**Thought process:**  
- The request says the groove should have not only hi-hat but also tom; currently, it lacks hi-hat and tom.  
- Add a subtle hi-hat pattern to support the ride rhythmâ€”use soft closed hi-hat hits (`x`) on offbeats.  
- Add tom hits to add melodic/rhythmic texture. Place toms on offbeats or near snare hits.  
- Use a mix of soft (`o`) and hard (`O`) tom hits for dynamic interest.  
- Keep kick, snare, and ride parts unchanged to preserve feel.
