The given groove already has kick hits on the K line, though some are soft hits (`o`). Perhaps the request implies to strengthen or add more kick presence alongside the snare.

**Thought process:**

- The kick line has hits on 1 (hard `O`), 3 (soft `o`), 5 and 7 (hard/soft). To emphasize kick presence, I will add a couple more kick hits, mainly filling in some quieter spots with soft hits, keeping the groove balanced.

- Leave snare and other parts as is.
