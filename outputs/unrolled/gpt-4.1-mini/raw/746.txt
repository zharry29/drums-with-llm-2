The original groove:

```
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a cymbal hit and snare in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Cymbal (C) first character is 'O', already a hard crash cymbal hit, so no change needed.
- Snare (S) first character is '-', no hit. Add a hard snare hit 'O' at that position.
- Other lines remain unchanged.

Final groove:
