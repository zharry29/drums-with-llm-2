The original groove currently only has soft closed hi-hat hits (H line) and ride cymbal hits (R line), but no kick or snare.

---

**Request:** Add snare along with hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the existing hi-hat and ride parts intact to preserve feel.  
- Add snare hits on the backbeats (typically beats 2 and 4) using hard hits 'O' to make the snare presence clear.  
- No kick or crash requested, so keep them silent.
