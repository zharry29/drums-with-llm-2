To make the given groove sound more like metal, I'll focus on the following adjustments:

- Kick drum: Faster and steadier double-kick pattern with consistent 16th note hits to drive the groove.

- Snare: Hard backbeat on 2 and 4, with some ghost snare hits for intensity.

- Hi-hat: Replace the sparse pattern with constant hard closed hi-hat 16th notes.

- Toms: Add sporadic tom hits for fills and dynamics.

- Crashes: Keep occasional crash accents on strong beats.

- Ride: Generally silent or optional.

**Original groove:**

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

**Metal-style changes:**

- Kick drum: Continuous 16th notes on beats 1 and 2, then fill in the rest with tight control to maintain power.

- Snare: Hard hits on beats 2 and 4 (`O`), with ghost hits (`o`) right before the main snare to add groove and aggression.

- Hi-hat: All 16th notes, hard closed (`X`) for aggression.

- Toms: Add a tom fill on beat 4 (like `O-o-`), to enhance intensity.

- Crash cymbal: Keep on beat 1 of bars for accent.

- Ride: off.
