The original groove already has kick and toms. The request is for groove to have not only kick but also tom, so the original groove satisfies this.

**Thought process:**  
- The kick pattern appears on 1st beat and 4th beat, toms consistently hit on each beat with a soft hit ‘o’ on the 2nd 16th note and a hard hit ‘O’ on the 1st 16th note of each beat.  
- Snare has a hard hit on the 3rd beat, which fits well.  
- Hi-hat, crash, ride are silent, which is fine as per original pattern.

No changes strictly needed since the groove already includes toms and kicks.
