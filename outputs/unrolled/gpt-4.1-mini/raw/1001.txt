Request:  
- Play closed hi-hat on all 8th notes (so on every downbeat and upbeat), but open hi-hat on every upbeat.  
- All hits are hard (accented).  

Let's clarify 8th notes within the 16th note grid:  
Each beat has 4 sixteenths positions: `1 2 3 4`  
Quarter notes = position 1,5,9,13  
Upbeats = the "and" of each beat = position 3,7,11,15 (the 2nd 8th note within each beat)  

So:  
- Closed hi-hat on all downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13) — hard = `X`  
- Open hi-hat on all upbeats (positions 3,7,11,15) — hard open = `O`  

All other 16th notes (positions 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16) remain silent = `-`

Positions per beat (4 sixteenths):  
1 (downbeat), 2, 3 (upbeat), 4  
Positions over 4 beats:  
1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 | 9 10 11 12 | 13 14 15 16  

We assign:  
Positions 1,5,9,13 = `X`  
Positions 3,7,11,15 = `O`  
Others = `-`

Improving from original:  
Original hi-hat line: `----|x---|----|x---`  
We will replace it with the new pattern of each 16th bar as above.

---

Final hi-hat line:  
`X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-`

---

Rest of the pattern unchanged.
