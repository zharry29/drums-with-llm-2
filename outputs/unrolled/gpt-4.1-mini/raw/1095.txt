The original groove has:

- Kick on beat 1 and 3 (hard hits, `O`).
- Snare on beat 2 and 4 (hard hits, `O`).
- Hi-hat playing on beat 1 of every beat (hard closed hits, `X---|X---|X---|X---`).
- Toms silent.

The edit request is to replace the hi-hat with toms, presumably keeping the same rhythmic positions but moving the pattern from hi-hat to toms.

---

**Thought process:**

- The hi-hat pattern is on the first 16th note of each beat.

- Replace those hi-hat hits (`X`) with tom hits (`O`) in the exact same spots.

- Keep everything else unchanged.
