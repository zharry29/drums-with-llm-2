The original groove already features soft kicks (o) and some soft sidestick snare hits (X), with hi-hat and ride cymbals playing soft and varied rhythms. The request wants the groove to have not only cymbal but also kick â€” meaning the kick should be more present or clear.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The kick hits are currently soft and sparse.  
- I'll add some stronger kick hits (O) on the downbeats (1 and 3) to emphasize the kick presence while keeping the groove light with soft hits elsewhere.  
- Keep the existing snare sidesticks, hi-hat, and ride patterns.
