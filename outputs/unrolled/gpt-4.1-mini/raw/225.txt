The original groove currently has no kick and no toms. The request is for the groove to have not only kick but also tom.

**Thought process:**  
- Add kick drum hits to provide a basic pulse â€” a common pattern could be kick on beats 1 and 3 (downbeats), or a bit more syncopated to fit the ride and hi-hat pattern.  
- Add tom hits to complement the groove, placed thoughtfully to add rhythmic interest.  
- Keep existing hi-hat and ride cymbal patterns.  
- No snare or crash requested to add, so leave those empty.
