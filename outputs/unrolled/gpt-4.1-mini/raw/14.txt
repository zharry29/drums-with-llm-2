Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick hits:

  - Beat 1: downbeat (pos 1, O)

  - Beat 2: downbeat (pos 5, O)

  - Beat 4: downbeat (pos 13, O)

- Snare hits:

  - Beat 3: downbeat (pos 9, O)

- Hihat: silent

- Toms: on every beat starting with hard hit (O), then soft (o), then soft (o), repeating per beat: "O-o-"

---

**Request**: Add some kick to the groove.

---

**Thoughts:**

- The kick is currently only on downbeats 1, 2, and 4.

- Add some syncopation by placing kicks on the "and" of beat 1 and beat 3 (positions 3 and 11).

- These kicks will add rhythmic drive without overcrowding.

- Make both new kicks soft hits (o) to keep dynamics balanced.

---

**New kick line:**

Positions with hits:  
- Beat 1: 1 (O), 3 (o)  
- Beat 2: 5 (O)  
- Beat 3: 9 (silent), 11 (o)  
- Beat 4: 13 (O)

So:
K: O-o-|O---|--o-|O---
