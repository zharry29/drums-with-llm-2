Let's analyze the groove and the request:

Original groove:

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: *Avoid snare on the downbeat of 2 and 4.*

- The downbeat of 2 is the first 16th note in the second beat, i.e., position 5 in the line.
- The downbeat of 4 is the first 16th note in the fourth beat, i.e., position 13.

Look at the Snare line:

- Currently, the Snare line is: `----|----|S---|----`

Positions:

- 5th character (downbeat 2): `-`
- 13th character (downbeat 4): `-`
- The Snare hit “S” is at position 9 (third beat, first character), which is fine.

So there are no snare hits on the downbeats of 2 and 4 already.

Hence, no change is necessary.

Final groove is the same as original:
