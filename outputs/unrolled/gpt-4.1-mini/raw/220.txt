The original groove already has cymbal (crash on the downbeat) and snare (soft snare hits on beats 2 and 4 in bars 2 and 4). Since the request wants the groove to have not only cymbal but also snare, I will add more prominent snare hits to emphasize the snare presence.

**Thought process:**  
- Add some hard snare hits ('O') on beats 2 and 4 to strengthen the backbeat.  
- Keep the cymbal crash on beat 1 of the first bar.  
- Maintain the delicate hi-hat pattern.
