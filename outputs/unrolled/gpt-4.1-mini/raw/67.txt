The current groove contains:  
- Kick drum pattern with varied hard and soft hits.  
- Snare hits on the second and fourth beats.  
- Hi-hat with both soft open hits (`o`) and hard open hits (`O`) on offbeats and downbeats mixed.  
- Crash cymbal on the first beat of the first bar.  
- No ride cymbal (`R`) hits.

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only ride but also hi-hat.  
Hi-hat is present, but ride cymbal is missing.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Maintain the current hi-hat pattern as itâ€™s expressive and dynamic.  
- Add ride cymbal to provide the ride presence requested.  
- Add closed soft ride hits (`x`) on every beat, e.g., on the downbeat of each beat (positions 1,5,9,13) to complement the groove without overpowering.  
- This provides a steady ride pulse alongside the hi-hat.
