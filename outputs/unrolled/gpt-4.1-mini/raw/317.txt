The original groove already has kick hits on beat 1 and 3 (hard hits `O---|----|O---|----`), and a snare hit on beat 2 and 4 (snare line `----|O---|----|O---`), plus hi-hat closed hits on all beats. The edit requests the groove to have not only snare but also kick.

Since kick is already present, but sparse, I can add some additional kick hits in between to balance the groove and make the kick more prominent.

**Thought process:**

- Keep existing kick hits on 1 and 3 beats.  
- Add a few extra softer kick hits (`o`) on off-beats to complement the snare.  
- Leave snare and hi-hat as is.
