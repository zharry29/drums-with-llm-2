The original groove has kick hits, a strange "S" character on the snare line (likely a typo or placeholder), closed hi-hat hits indicated by 'x', tom hits on beat 3 of bar 3, and crash cymbal hits on every downbeat. The request says the groove should have not only **snare but also hi-hat**. There is hi-hat present already (marked by 'x'), but the snare line seems to have an invalid character "S". So I will:

- Replace the "S" with proper snare hits (likely hard snare 'O' on backbeat).  
- Keep the hi-hat pattern as it is.  
- Preserve kicks, tom, and crashes.  
- Ride is empty as no ride is in original or requested.
