The original groove has kick, snare, and crash cymbal, but no hi-hat.

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only hi-hat but also snare.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the snare hits as they are (they are already present on beats 2 and 4).  
- Add a closed hi-hat pattern to complement the existing groove.  
- Keep kick and crash as is.
