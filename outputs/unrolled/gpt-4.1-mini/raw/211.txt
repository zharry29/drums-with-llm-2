The original groove includes kick, snare (soft open ‘S’), hi-hat closed hits, tom, and crash cymbal hits on every first 16th note of each beat. The request is to have both hi-hat and cymbal — cymbal is already there as crash.

To enrich the cymbal presence, I will add some ride cymbal closed hits (‘x’) on the off-beats to complement the crash, creating a fuller cymbal texture.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kick, snare, tom, and hi-hat as is to maintain groove.  
- Add ride cymbal closed hits on the upbeat 16th notes (positions 3, 7, 11, 15) for extra cymbal presence without cluttering.  
- Keep crashes on beat 1 of each beat as is.
