The original groove already has some kick hits on the K line (`O--O|----|--O-|----`), but the snare is more active. The edit request asks for the groove to have not only snare but also kick, so it would be good to add a few more kicks to balance with the snare.

**Thought process**:  
- Keep the original snare pattern as is.  
- Add some kick hits to complement the snare rhythm, filling in some quieter spots with soft kicks (`o`) and reinforcing on main beats.
