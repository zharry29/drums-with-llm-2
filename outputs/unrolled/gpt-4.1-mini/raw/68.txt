The current groove has:  
- Kick with soft hits (o).  
- Snare with soft sidestick hits (X) sporadically.  
- Hi-hat with sparse soft closed hits (`x`).  
- Ride cymbal plays a steady pattern with mixed hard and soft closed hits.  

---

**Request:** The groove should have **not only ride but also hi-hat**.  
There are hi-hat hits but very light and sparse.

---

**Thought process:**  
- To fulfill the request, I will make hi-hat more prominent and consistent, adding soft closed hits (`x`) on offbeats (8th-note offbeats: positions 3,7,11,15).  
- Keep existing ride cymbal pattern as is.  
- Kick and snare remain unchanged.

Final hi-hat line:  
`--x-|x-x-|--x-|x-x-`
