Let's look at the original hi-hat pattern:

```
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
```

- Beat 1 has a soft open hit on the 3rd 16th note.

- Beats 2, 3, and 4 have the pattern: hard open, soft open, hard open, soft open hits on each 16th note, except the last one missing.

---

### Request:

Make the hi-hat pattern more varied.

---

### Thought Process:

- Add more rhythmic variety by mixing soft and hard closed hits (`x` and `X`).

- Introduce some rests (`-`) to add syncopation.

- Keep some open hi-hats for texture.

- Perhaps switch some hits from open to closed hi-hats.

---

### Proposed pattern per beat (4 x 16ths each):

1. Beat 1: `x--o` (soft closed, rest, rest, soft open)

2. Beat 2: `Xo-x` (hard closed, soft open, rest, soft closed)

3. Beat 3: `oxX-` (soft open, soft closed, hard closed, rest)

4. Beat 4: `x-oX` (soft closed, rest, soft open, hard closed)

---

### Final hi-hat line:

```
H: x--o|Xo-x|oxX-|x-oX
```

---

### Final groove:
