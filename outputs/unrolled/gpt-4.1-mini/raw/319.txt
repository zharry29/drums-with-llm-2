The groove as given already has kick notes on beats 1 and 4, with some space in bar 3 where the kick is missing. The snare appears on beat 3. The edit request asks for the groove to have not only snare but also kick, so I will add some additional kick notes especially around the snare hits to reinforce the rhythm.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the existing kick hits on beats 1 and 4.  
- Add kick notes on 3rd beat of bar 3 where the snare is.  
- Add some additional soft kick hits in between to give better flow and more presence.
