The groove already has some hi-hat soft closed hits (`x`) on positions 6 and 16 (the second 16th note of beat 2 and beat 4). The request is to add more hi-hat to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**  
- To create a steady hi-hat pulse, I'll add soft closed hi-hat hits (`x`) on all the offbeat 8th notes (the "and" of each beat), which corresponds to 3, 7, 11, 15.  
- This will complement the existing hits at 6 and 16 and create a driving groove without cluttering.

Positions of hi-hat hits (`x`):  
Existing: 6, 16  
Added: 3, 7, 11, 15

Final hi-hat line:  
`--x-|xx-x|--x-|xx-x`  

Where the `x` at positions 3, 6, 7, 11, 15, 16.
