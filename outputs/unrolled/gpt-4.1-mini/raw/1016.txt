The original groove has no tom hits:

```
T: ----|----|----|----
```

The request is to keep the same placement of tom (which means no tom hits) but make it more dynamic.

Since there are no tom hits at all, there's no placement to alter or make more dynamic.

Therefore, tom line remains silent.

All other parts stay as is.
