The "a" of the second beat corresponds to the 4th 16th note of the second beat. Counting 16th notes starting from 0, the second beat covers indices 4 to 7:
- 4 = 1
- 5 = e
- 6 = &
- 7 = a

I need to add a cymbal hit at index 7 in the second beat.

Currently, the crash (C) and ride (R) cymbals have no hits:

C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

I will add a hard crash cymbal hit 'O' at index 7 (the 'a' of second beat) in the crash cymbal line.
