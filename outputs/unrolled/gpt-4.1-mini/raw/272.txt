The original groove has kick, snare, and closed hi-hat hits, but no ride cymbal. The request states the groove should have not only ride but also kick. Since there is kick already, I need to add a ride cymbal pattern to complement the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the kick and snare pattern as is.  
- Keep closed hi-hat hits on the downbeats.  
- Add ride cymbal hits (`x`) on steady 8th notes to add ride presence without overwhelming the groove.
