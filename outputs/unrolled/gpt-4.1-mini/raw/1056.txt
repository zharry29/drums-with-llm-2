Let's examine the kick (K) pattern first:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
```

There are **no kick hits** in this groove.

The request is to keep the **same placement** of the kick but make it **more dynamic**.

Since there are no kick hits present, to keep the same placement means the kick line should remain silent.

Therefore, no change is possible on the kick line.
