The original groove's kick pattern is somewhat sparse, with hits:

- Beat 1: position 2 (soft `O`)  
- Beat 1: position 5,6 (two hard `O`s)  
- Beat 3: position 12 (hard `O`)  
- Beat 4: position 14,15 (hard `O`s)  

The request is to fill the whole bar with double kick, meaning two kicks per beat, typically on the 1st and 3rd 16th note of each beat, i.e., positions 1 & 3, 5 & 7, 9 & 11, 13 & 15.

So the kick line should be:

`O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O-`

Other instruments (S, H, T, C, R) remain the same.
