The original groove has kick, snare, and ride cymbal. The snare line already includes some open snare hits (`o`) but the edit request wants to emphasize that the groove should have "not only ride but also snare." So I will slightly strengthen the snare presence by adding some hard snare hits (`O`) on backbeats to support the groove while keeping the ride pattern unchanged.

**Thought process:**

- Keep kick and ride cymbal pattern intact.  
- In the snare line, maintain open hits but add hard snare hits (`O`) on beats 2 and 4 for a more defined backbeat.  
- Keep hi-hat line empty as per original.
