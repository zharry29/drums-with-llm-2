The original groove contains kick, snare, and ride cymbal but no hi-hat, while the request asks to add hi-hat along with cymbal.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kick, snare, and ride as is.  
- Add closed hi-hat hits (`x`) mainly on the off-beats (the "ands") to create a nice groove alongside the ride.  
- Keep hi-hat subtle and complementary to the ride pattern.
