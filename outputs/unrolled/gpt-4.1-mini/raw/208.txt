The original groove has kick, snare sidesticks, hi-hat closed hits, and ride cymbal closed and open hits. The request is to add cymbal (typically crash cymbal) in addition to hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add crash cymbal hits ('O') on the downbeats or accents to complement the ride and hi-hat pattern.  
- Since the groove is loose and subtle, one crash hit on the first beat will fit nicely to add some cymbal presence without overloading.  
- Keep other parts unchanged.
