The current groove has:  
- Kick hits on the downbeats of 1 and 3 beats.  
- Snare on beats 2 and 4 downbeats.  
- Hi-hat with hard closed hits (`X`) on the downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13).  
- No ride cymbal hits.

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only cymbal but also **ride**.  
There is already a cymbal here (hi-hat), so we just need to add ride.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep existing kick, snare, and hi-hat unchanged.  
- Add ride cymbal with soft closed hits (`x`) on the offbeats (e.g., positions 3,7,11,15) to complement the hi-hat pattern without cluttering.

Final ride cymbal line:  
`--x-|--x-|--x-|--x-`
