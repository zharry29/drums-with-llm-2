The original groove includes kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash cymbal, but no ride cymbal. The request is to include both ride and snare. Since snare is already present, the main task is to add ride cymbal while keeping the rest intact.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Maintain existing kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash.  
- Add ride cymbal playing steady 8th notes (closed hits `x` and `X`) for consistent groove.  
- Keep the ride pattern complementary to the hi-hat.
