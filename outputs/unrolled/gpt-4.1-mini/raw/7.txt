The original groove:

- Kick drum: hits on 1, the "and" of 2 (soft o), and a small cluster on beat 3 (O-O-)
- Snare: hits on beat 2 and beat 4
- Hihat: quite active with open and soft hits on various 16th notes
- Tom: none yet
- Crash cymbal: crash on downbeat 1
- Ride: none

---

Goal: add some toms that fit rhythmically and add texture, without cluttering.

---

Approach:

- The groove is quite active on kick and hi-hat; toms could provide color mainly in the latter half of the bar.

- I'll add tom hits on beat 3 and 4, complementing the kick cluster and snare at end.

- Since the kick hits on beat 3 are hard and syncopated, I'll put tom soft hits 'o' between kick hits on beat 3 to fill texture.

- A hard tom hit 'O' on beat 4 earlier than the snare to add interest.

Mapping 16th notes (positions 1-16):

- Beat 3: 9-12

- Beat 4: 13-16

I will add:

- Beat 3: an 'o' tom on position 10 (2nd 16th of beat 3) to fill space between kick hits (which are on 9 and 11).

- Beat 4: an 'O' tom on position 14 (2nd 16th of beat 4), before the snare hit on 13.
