The original groove includes kick, a questionable snare notation "S" (which is not part of the provided notation), hi-hat, tom, and crash, but no ride cymbal. The edit request wants the groove to have not only hi-hat but also ride. So I need to add a ride cymbal pattern.

**Thought process:**

- Replace the non-standard "S" in the snare line with an appropriate snare notation. Since "S" is unclear, I will convert it to a soft snare open hit (`o`) to maintain groove flow.
- Keep kick, hi-hat, tom, crash as they are.
- Add ride cymbal closed hits (`x`) on steady 8th notes (every 2 sixteenth notes) for a natural ride pattern.
