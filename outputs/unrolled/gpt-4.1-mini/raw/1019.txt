The original hihat part is:

```
H: ----|x---|----|x---
```

The hits are on the second sixteenth note of the second and fourth beats, both soft closed hihat hits (`x`).

To make it more dynamic but keep the same placement, I can alternate the articulation of those hits, introducing hard hits (X) mixed with soft (x), or add open hits (o or O) nearby, or add ghost notes.

I will keep the hits on the same 2nd sixteenth note positions of beats 2 and 4, but I'll increase dynamic contrast by changing the first hihat hit to a hard closed hit (`X`) and add a soft open hit (`o`) right after it, to give a dynamic feel.

Similarly for the last hit, I'll make it a hard closed (`X`) plus a soft open hit (`o`) immediately afterwards.

Since the first measure only has a second note hit on beat 2 (position 6 overall), I'll keep that as:

Beat 2 (positions 5-8): x--- → change to Xo-- to introduce hard closed and soft open hits.

Similarly for beat 4 (positions 13-16): x--- → Xo--.

Making the hihat line:

Beat 1 (positions 1-4): ----  
Beat 2 (5-8): Xo--  
Beat 3 (9-12): ----  
Beat 4 (13-16): Xo--

Thus:

```
H: ----|Xo--|----|Xo--
```

All other parts remain the same.
