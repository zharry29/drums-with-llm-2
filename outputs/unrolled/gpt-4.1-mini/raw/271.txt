The original groove has kick, snare, and hi-hat, but no ride cymbal. The request wants the groove to have not only ride but also kick. So I need to add ride cymbal pattern while keeping the kick and other parts.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the kick (`K`) and snare (`S`) lines as is.  
- The hi-hat line is closed side-stick hits (`X` and `x`), keep as is.  
- Add ride cymbal hits (`x`) on the off-beats (e.g., 8th notes) for a nice complementary ride pattern.

Final groove:
