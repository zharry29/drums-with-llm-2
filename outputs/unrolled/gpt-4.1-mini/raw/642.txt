The original groove:

```
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a ride hit and tom in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Ride cymbal (R) first character is "-", so no ride hit there yet.
- Add a hard closed ride cymbal hit "X" on the bow at the first character to emphasize the ride.
- Tom (T) first character is "-", so add a tom hard hit "O" at the first character.
- Other parts remain unchanged.
