The current groove has:  
- Kick (`K`) with a pattern emphasizing the first half of the bar.  
- Snare (`S`) with a single hit on the 3rd beat, 1st 16th note. (The character `S` is unexpected here; likely a typo for `O` or `o`. I will interpret this as a snare hit (`O`) for coherence.)  
- Hi-hat (`H`) playing steady closed hits (`x`) on 8th notes (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15).  
- Toms (`T`) have a single hit on the 14th 16th note.  
- Crash cymbal (`C`) on every downbeat (positions 1,5,9,13).  
- No ride cymbal hits.

---

**Request:** Groove should have **not only cymbal but also ride**.  
Currently, there are crashes but no ride cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add ride cymbal with soft closed hits (`x`) on the off-beats (e.g., 16th note positions 3,7,11,15) to complement the hi-hat and crash cymbal.  
- Keep all other parts unchanged.

Final ride cymbal line:  
`-x-x|-x-x|-x-x|-x-x`
