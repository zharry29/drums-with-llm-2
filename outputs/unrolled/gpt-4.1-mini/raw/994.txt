The request is to play closed hi-hat on every 16th note with accents on the quarter note downbeats.  

Hi-hat notation reminder:  
- `X` = hard closed hit (accent on downbeat)  
- `x` = soft closed hit (non-accent)

Positions 1, 5, 9, and 13 (the first 16th note of each beat) get `X`, and the rest get `x`.  
That creates this repeating pattern of 4 for each beat: `Xxxx`.  

Original hi-hat line:  
`x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-`

New hi-hat line will be:  
`Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx`

Other instrument lines remain unchanged.
