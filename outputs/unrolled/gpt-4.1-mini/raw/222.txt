The original groove has kick (with a soft hit 'O' and a symbol 'S' currently on the snare lineâ€”which is non-standard, as 'S' isn't part of the given snare notation), hi-hat closed hits ('x'), toms (one hard hit), crash cymbals on every downbeat, and no snare hits properly notated.

Request: groove should have not only cymbal (which it already has) but also snare. The snare line currently incorrectly has an 'S' symbol that should be replaced by snare notation (e.g. 'O' for hard snare or 'o' for soft snare).

**Thought process:**  
- Replace the 'S' with a proper snare hit (preferably a hard snare hit 'O' on the downbeat of the third beat to keep groove feel).  
- Possibly add an additional snare on the backbeat for a more classic groove (beat 2 and/or 4).  
- Keep kick, hi-hat, tom, and crash as is.
