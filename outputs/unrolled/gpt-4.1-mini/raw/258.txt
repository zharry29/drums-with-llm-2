The original groove already has both kick and ride parts present: soft kick hits (`o`) scattered and closed+open ride hits (`x` and `X`) on the bell.

**Thought process:**  
- The request is to ensure the groove has not only kick but also rideâ€”both are already there.  
- To clarify and balance the groove, I will slightly enhance the ride pattern by adding a bit more presence on offbeats, keeping the kick pattern as is.  
- Maintain snare and hi-hat untouched.
