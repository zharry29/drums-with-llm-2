The request is to remove cymbal and ride hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Hi-hat (H) contains soft closed hits (`x`), which are cymbals → remove by replacing with `-`.  
- Ride (R) contains closed hits (`x`, `X`) → remove by replacing with `-`.  
- Kick (K), Snare (S), Toms (T), and Crash (C) are empty lines so no changes needed.
