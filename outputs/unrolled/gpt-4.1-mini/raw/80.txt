The current groove has:  
- Kick pattern with strong hits on beat 1 of bars 1,2, and 4.  
- Snare hit on beat 3, bar 3.  
- Toms playing a repetitive pattern of hard and soft hits.  
- No hi-hat, crash, or ride cymbal present.

---

**Request:** Groove should have **not only cymbal but also ride**.  
No cymbals at all currently, so we need to add some cymbal(s) including a ride cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add ride cymbal with soft closed hits (`x`) on the offbeats (positions 3,7,11,15) throughout the bar for a steady ride pattern that complements tom rhythm.  
- Add hi-hat with soft closed hits (`x`) on the downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13) to include cymbals in addition to the ride.  
- Keep kick, snare, toms unchanged.  
- No crash cymbal added to maintain groove smoothness.
