Let's analyze the snare placement:

Original snare line:

```
S: ----|O---|----|O---
```

Snare hits are on:

- Beat 2, 1st 16th note: hard hit `O`  
- Beat 4, 1st 16th note: hard hit `O`

To keep the same placement but add more dynamics:

- Add ghost notes or softer snare articulations around these hits without moving them.

- Add soft open snare hits (`o`) or soft sidestick hits (`x`) on nearby 16th notes within the same beats.

- We can also add soft sidesticks (`x`) or even hard sidesticks (`X`) right before or after the main snare hit to increase the dynamic texture.

Proposed edits:

- Beat 2:

  - Keep the `O` on the 1st 16th note.  
  - Add a soft sidestick (`x`) on the 3rd 16th note â€” this acts like a ghost note to add dynamics.  

- Beat 4:

  - Keep the `O` on the 1st 16th note.  
  - Add a soft sidestick (`x`) on the 3rd 16th note for symmetry.

Revised snare line:

```
S: ----|O--x|----|O--x
```
