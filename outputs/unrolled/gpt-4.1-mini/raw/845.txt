The original groove:

```
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a kick hit and cymbal in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Kick (K) at very beginning (first 16th note) is 'O' (hard hit), so already present.
- Cymbal (Crash C) has a hard hit 'O' at first 16th note, so it's also already present.
- Both requested hits are present; no changes needed.
