The original groove features kick hits, snare hits with hard hits 'O', and hard sidestick hi-hat hits 'X'. There are no tom or cymbal hits. The request is to add both tom and cymbal.

**Thought process:**  
- Add some tom hits (hard hits 'O') to fill in rhythmic gaps and add melodic color. Placing them in off-beats or between kick/snare hits.  
- Add cymbal hits (crash 'O') on downbeats to complement the groove.  
- Keep the rest of the groove intact.
