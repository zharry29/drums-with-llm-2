The original groove has kick, snare, and ride but no tom or hi-hat.

---

**Request:** Add tom and hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits sparingly to add tom presence, fitting rhythmically with existing parts.  
- Add hi-hat pattern, likely closed hi-hat, to support the groove without overpowering.  
- Keep kick, snare, and ride as is.
