The original groove has a very active kick pattern, a couple of snare hits, crash cymbal hits on every downbeat, and no tom hits. The edit request asks to have not only tom but also cymbal, so we need to add tom hits while keeping cymbals present.

**Thought process:**

- Introduce tom hits (hard hits 'O' for strong impact) fitting the groove naturally.  
- Maintain existing crash cymbal hits.  
- Keep the snare and kick pattern to keep the groove's feel.  
- Tom hits can be placed in spaces where they fill rhythmic gaps or add textural interest, for instance, on offbeats or just before cymbal crashes to complement them.
