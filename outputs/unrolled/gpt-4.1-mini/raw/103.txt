The original groove has quite a few kick hits and a ride cymbal pattern, but no hi-hat at all.

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only hi-hat but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Since kick is already present, I will add a steady closed hi-hat pattern (`x`) on the typical 8th notes (positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15) to add hi-hat presence.  
- Leave kick, snare, toms, crash, and ride unchanged.  
- The groove becomes fuller with the added hi-hat.
