The original groove has kick and snare (with soft and hard hits), but no hi-hat or crash cymbal â€“ only ride cymbal with open and bell hits (`o-O-` pattern). The edit request states the groove should have not only snare but also cymbal. Since the ride cymbal is already present, I will add a complementary closed hi-hat pattern to enrich cymbal presence.

**Thought process:**
- Keep kick and snare as is.
- Keep the ride cymbal pattern as is.
- Add hi-hat closed hits (`x`) to provide more cymbal texture, playing steady 8th notes.
- Leave tom and crash empty.
