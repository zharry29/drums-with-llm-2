The current groove has:  
- Kick drum playing soft hits intermittently on beats 1 and 3 subdivisions.  
- Snare playing sidesticks (X) on some offbeats.  
- Hi-hat soft closed hits only twice.  
- Ride cymbal playing closed bow hits (x and X) on offbeat 16th notes.  
- No crash cymbal hits at all.

---

**Request:** Add cymbal to the groove (in addition to kick).

---

**Thought process:**  
- Introduce crash cymbal hits on strong downbeats to add accents and dynamics.  
- Since the groove is fairly sparse, placing crash cymbal hits on the first 16th note of beat 1 and beat 3 (positions 1 and 9) would work well.  
- Use hard crash hits ‘O’ at these positions.
