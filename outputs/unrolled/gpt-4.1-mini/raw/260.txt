The original groove contains kick, snare (with an unusual "S" notation, which seems like a placeholder for snare, I will replace it by a valid snare note), hi-hat, and crash but no ride. The request is to include ride along with kick.

**Thought process:**  
- Replace the "S" with a proper snare hit notation (I will use a soft sidestick hit, `x`) to keep the groove consistent.  
- Add ride cymbal closed hits (`x`) on every 8th note to complement the existing hi-hat pattern.  
- Maintain existing kick, snare, hi-hat and crash parts.
