The "a" of the second beat corresponds to the 4th 16th note of beat 2. Counting 16th notes starting from 0, beat 2 covers positions 4 to 7:
- 4 = 1
- 5 = e
- 6 = &
- 7 = a

We need to add a cymbal hit at position 7.

Currently, the Crash cymbal (C) line is:  
`O---|O---|O---|O---`  
At beat 2 (positions 4-7) it's `O---` - only a hit at position 4.

We can add a cymbal hit at position 7 by changing the second beat cymbal pattern from `O---` to `---O`.
