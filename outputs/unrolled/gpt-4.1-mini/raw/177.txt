The original groove has kick, snare, and ride cymbal hits but no tom or crash cymbal. The request is to add tom and cymbal (crash or additional cymbal) hits.

**Thought process:**  
- Add a few tom hits (hard 'O') in the 3rd bar to make groove more dynamic and percussive.  
- Add crash cymbal hits (hard 'O') on downbeats in bar 1 and 3 to add cymbal presence along with the ride line.  
- Keep existing kick, snare, and ride as is for groove consistency.
