The original groove features:

- Kick on beat 1 and beat 3 downbeats.

- Snare on beat 2 and beat 4 downbeats only.

- Hihat with hard closed hits on every downbeat.

- No toms, crash, or ride.

**Request:** Add some snare to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**

- Currently snare hits are only on the 2nd and 4th beat downbeats (positions 5 and 13).

- To add more snare presence, we can add soft snare ghost hits ('o') on the "e" and "a" 16th notes of beats 2 and 4 (positions 6 and 8 for beat 2, 14 and 16 for beat 4).

- This adds a subtle rhythmic texture without overpowering the groove.

Updated snare line:

- Beat 2 (positions 5–8): O o o o

- Beat 4 (positions 13–16): O o o o

Resulting snare:
