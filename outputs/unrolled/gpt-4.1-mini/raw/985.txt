The original groove has no kick drum hits, and the request is to fill the whole bar with double kick. A double kick pattern typically means two kick hits per beat, often on the 1st and 3rd 16th notes of each beat, i.e., positions 1 and 3, 5 and 7, 9 and 11, 13 and 15 in a 16th note subdivision bar.

Following that, the kick line will feature hard hits (`O`) on positions 1 & 3, 5 & 7, 9 & 11, and 13 & 15.

All other instruments remain unchanged.
