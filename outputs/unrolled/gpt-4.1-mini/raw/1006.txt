The request is to:

- Play the closed hi-hat on all 8th notes,
- Use open hi-hat on every upbeat,
- Keep all hits hard.

In a 16-step pattern (16 sixteenth notes per bar):

- Downbeats (quarter notes): positions 1,5,9,13
- Upbeats ("ands"): positions 3,7,11,15

So on these 8th notes:

- Closed hi-hat on downbeats = `X`
- Open hi-hat on upbeats = `O`
- All other notes are silent (`-`)

Thus, the hi-hat pattern becomes:

`X-O-|X-O-|X-O-|X-O-`
