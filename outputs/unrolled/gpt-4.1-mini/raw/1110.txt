The 'a' of the second beat corresponds to the 4th 16th note of the second beat. Counting the 16th notes from 0 to 15 in the bar:

- Beat 1: positions 0 to 3  
- Beat 2: positions 4 to 7  
- Beat 3: positions 8 to 11  
- Beat 4: positions 12 to 15  

Within beat 2:  
- 4 = 1  
- 5 = e  
- 6 = &  
- 7 = a  

We should add a cymbal hit on position 7 (the last 16th of beat 2).

Currently the cymbal lines (`C` and `R`) are empty.

No articulation was specified, so I will add a soft crash cymbal hit (`o`) on position 7 of beat 2.

The second beat cymbal string for the crash line is `----`. Changing to `---o`.
