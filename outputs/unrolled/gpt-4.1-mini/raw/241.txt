The original groove has kick, snare, and hi-hat patterns but no toms.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits to complement the groove without cluttering it.  
- Place tom hits on some offbeats or near snare/kick hits to add rhythmic interest.  
- Use soft tom hits (`o`) sometimes for texture, and maybe one or two hard hits (`O`) to emphasize.  
- Keep other parts unchanged.
