The original groove has kicks on beats 1 and 2 and beat 4, snare on beat 3, and a tom pattern throughout. There is no cymbal currently.

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only cymbal but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Since thereâ€™s no cymbal in the original groove, I will add a hi-hat pattern (closed hits) for cymbals to fulfill the request.  
- Keep the kick and snare hits as is to preserve the existing groove.  
- Keep the toms untouched.
