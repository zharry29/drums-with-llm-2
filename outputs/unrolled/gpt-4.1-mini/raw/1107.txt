To make the groove double time, the tempo feels twice as fast, so the notes that occurred on quarter or eighth notes will now space out twice as often in 16th note subdivisions.

Currently, the hi-hat hits are on the 2nd 16th note of beats 2 and 4, and the ride cymbal hits are on every 1st and 3rd 16th note in each beat pattern.

To double time this:

- Place hi-hat hits on every second 16th note (8th notes), effectively doubling the frequency.

- Double ride cymbal hits, filling in doubled spaces with the same pattern but now more frequent.

- Add some kick or snare hits to fill the extra space; since none were previously present, we can keep it minimal or sparse.

Since the original is very sparse, doubling hits in hi-hat and ride will reflect double time.
