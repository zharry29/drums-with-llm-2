The groove currently has kick hits (`O` and `O`s) on various positions and a single snare note marked as `S` in the third beat of the third bar (which is unconventional notation, since the snare typically uses `O`, `o`, `X`, or `x`). To maintain consistency, I will convert this `S` to a hard snare hit (`O`) and add more kick hits to balance with the snare presence, as requested.

**Thought process:**

- Replace the unconventional `S` with a hard snare hit `O` in the third beat, third bar.  
- Confirm the groove already has kicks but add some extra kick hits to emphasize.  
- Keep hihat and crash as is.
