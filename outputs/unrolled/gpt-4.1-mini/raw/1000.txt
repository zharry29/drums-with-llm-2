The request is to add closed hi-hat hits on every 16th note, with accents on the quarter note downbeats.

Hi-hat notation:  
- `X` = hard closed hit (accented, on quarter note downbeats)  
- `x` = soft closed hit (all other 16th notes)

Positions 1, 5, 9, and 13 are the quarter note downbeats; these get `X`, and the rest get `x`.

The original hi-hat line is empty: `----|----|----|----`

We replace it with: `Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx`

All other instruments remain unchanged.
