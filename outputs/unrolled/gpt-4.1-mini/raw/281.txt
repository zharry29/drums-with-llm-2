The original groove already has kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash cymbal parts, but no ride cymbal. The edit request wants the groove to have not only snare but also ride. Since snare is present, I will keep it and add a ride cymbal pattern that complements the existing groove. The hi-hat is playing open and soft hits, so the ride will add a new texture.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kick (`K`) and snare (`S`) as is.  
- Keep hi-hat (`H`) as is.  
- Keep crash (`C`) as is.  
- Add ride cymbal (`R`) hits, using `x` for closed hits on the bow, on the off-beats (8th notes) for a smooth ride feel.
