The request is to reduce the number of notes, simplifying the groove while maintaining its structure.

Current groove notes analysis:

- Kick (K):  
  `OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO`  
  That means 3 hits in beat 1 (positions 1,2,3), 1 hit on position 6, 3 hits on beat 3 (positions 9,10,11), and 3 hits on beat 4 (positions 13,14,15). Pretty dense.

- Snare (S):  
  Hits at position 6 and 14 only.

- Hi-hat (H): Silent.

- Toms (T): Silent.

- Crash (C): Hit on the first 16th note of every beat (positions 1,5,9,13).

- Ride (R): Silent.

---

Simplification plan:

- Kick: Keep only one hit per beat instead of three; to keep groove's pulse, keep hits on positions 1, 6, 9, and 13.

- Snare: Keep the existing hits at positions 6 and 14.

- Crash: Keep the first crash only on position 1.

- Other instruments unchanged.
