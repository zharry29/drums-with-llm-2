The request is to remove cymbal and ride hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Crash cymbal (C) line is empty, so no change needed.  
- Ride cymbal (R) line is empty, so no change needed.  
- Hi-hat (H) contains closed hard hits (`X`), which are cymbals, so remove those by replacing with `-`.  
- Kick (K) and Snare (S) lines remain unchanged.
