The original groove already has plenty of kick hits (K line: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO), snare on beats 2 and 4, and crash cymbals on each beat. The edit requests the groove to have not only snare but also kick. Kick is already well represented, so no addition is strictly necessary. But to emphasize and balance kick + snare better, I can add some kick hits to places where snare plays to make those beats fuller.

**Thought process:**
- Keep existing kick hits.  
- Add kicks on snare beats (beat 2 of bar 2 and beat 4 of bar 4) to reinforce those backbeats.  
- Keep everything else as is.
