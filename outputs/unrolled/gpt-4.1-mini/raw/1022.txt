The original hihat hits are:

```
H: ----|x---|----|x---
```

So there are two soft closed hihat hits (`x`) on the second beat, first 16th note, and on the fourth beat, first 16th note.

To keep the same placement but make it more dynamic, I can alternate or mix the articulation of these hits.

I will change each `x` to a hard closed hihat hit `X` for more dynamic impact, and add a soft open hit `o` immediately following those hits to add expressiveness, while remaining on the same 16th-note placement.

- Beat 2 (positions 5-8): `x---` → `Xo--`  
- Beat 4 (positions 13-16): `x---` → `Xo--`

Rest remains the same.
