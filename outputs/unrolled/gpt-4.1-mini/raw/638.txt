The original groove:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
```

Request: "I'd like a kick hit and ride in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Kick drum (K) first character is "O" (hard hit), so kick hit is already present.
- Ride cymbal (R) first character is "o" (soft open hit on the bell).
- The request wants a ride in the beginning; there's already a ride hit (soft open), but I will upgrade to a hard open ride hit on the bell "O" to emphasize it.
- Other parts remain unchanged.
