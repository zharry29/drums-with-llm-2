The original groove features some kick hits, a snare hit marked as "S" (which is not one of the notation characters; assuming it's a typo for a snare hit), hi-hats with closed hits, tom hits on late 3rd beat, and crashes at the start of each beat. Ride cymbal is empty.

The request is to ensure the groove has both tom and snare. It already has tom and a snare hit; probably needs clearer, regular snare hits (marked with 'O' or 'o').

**Thought process:**  
- Replace or add proper snare hits ('O') on beats 2 and 4 to solidify backbeat presence.  
- Keep tom hits as they are or add one more tom hit if needed.  
- Keep kicks and crashes as is.  
- Leave ride empty as no request to add it.
