The original groove:

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

Request: "I'd like a ride hit and cymbal in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Ride (R) first character is 'x', which is a soft closed hit on the bow.
- Since the request is for a ride hit at the very beginning, upgrade this to a hard ride bell hit 'O'.
- Crash cymbal (C) first character is '-', no hit. Add a hard crash cymbal hit 'O'.
- Other lines remain the same.
