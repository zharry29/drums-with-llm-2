The original groove:

```
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a cymbal hit and kick in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Kick drum (K) first character is already "O" (hard hit), so kick is already present.
- Cymbal hit requested: Add a crash cymbal hit (C) at the first 16th note.
- The crash cymbal is already "O" at first character.
- So both kick and cymbal hits are already there at the very beginning.
- No change needed.
