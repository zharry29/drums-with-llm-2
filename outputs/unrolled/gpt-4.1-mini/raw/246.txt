The original groove includes kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash cymbal, but no toms.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits on the T line to complement the groove.  
- Place tom hits in the second and fourth measures for variation and interest.  
- Use soft tom hits (`o`) to blend with the existing dynamics and avoid clutter.  
- Keep the rest of the groove unchanged.
