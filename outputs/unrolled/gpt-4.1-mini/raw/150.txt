The original groove already has hi-hat and snare hits. The snare is currently on beats 2 and 4 (second 16th of 2nd beat and first 16th of 4th beat). The hi-hat includes open and soft hits in a syncopated pattern.

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only hi-hat but also snare â€” likely they want more presence or clearer snare hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Reinforce the snare hits as hard hits on beats 2 and 4 to emphasize snare presence.  
- Keep the hihat pattern intact.  
- Leave the rest as is to preserve the groove.
