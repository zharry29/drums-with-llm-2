The original groove has kick, hi-hat, snare indicated by "S" (which should be replaced by a valid snare character), and crash cymbal. The request is to have "not only hi-hat but also tom," so the tom should be added or emphasized.

---

**Thought process:**
- Replace the invalid snare 'S' with a proper notation, likely a hard snare hit 'O'.
- Add or enhance tom hits to meet the request.
- Keep the kick, hi-hat, and crash parts intact.
- Place tom hits where they complement the groove, such as around the snare or in fills.
