The original groove:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a hihat hit and kick in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- The very beginning is the first 16th note.
- Kick (K) first character is 'O' (already a hard hit), so no change needed.
- Hi-hat (H) first character is '-', no hit. Add a hard closed hi-hat hit 'x' (hard closed hit often notated with 'x').
- Other lines remain unchanged.

Final groove:
