The original groove has:  
- Kick drum hits on syncopated positions.  
- Snare with a mix of hard, soft, and open hits creating dynamics.  
- No hi-hat is present.  
- Ride cymbal plays a steady pattern of soft and hard hits on the bell.

---

**Request:** Add hi-hat to the groove (which already has kick and ride).

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add hi-hat soft closed hits (`x`) on every 8th note (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15) to maintain a steady pulse.  
- Keep kick, snare, and ride parts unchanged.
