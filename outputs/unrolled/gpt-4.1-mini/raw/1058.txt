Let's analyze the kick (K) placement:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
```

Breaking down each beat into 16th notes (4 notes per beat):

- Beat 1: `O--O` → hard hit on 1st and 4th 16th notes  
- Beat 2: `----` → no hits  
- Beat 3: `--O-` → hard hit on 3rd 16th note  
- Beat 4: `----` → no hits  

---

**Goal:** Keep same kick placement but make it more dynamic.

### How to add dynamics without changing placement?

- Change some hard `O` hits to soft `o` hits to vary hit intensity while keeping exact timing.

- For example, soften the 4th 16th note in beat 1 from `O` to `o`

- So beat 1 becomes `O--o`

- Similarly, soften the 3rd note in beat 3 from `O` to `o`

- Beat 3 becomes `--o-`

New kick line:

```
K: O--o|----|--o-|----
```
