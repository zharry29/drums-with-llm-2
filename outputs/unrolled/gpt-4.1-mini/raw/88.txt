The current groove consists of:  
- Kick hits on varied downbeats and syncopations.  
- Snare with mixed open and soft hits creating dynamics.  
- No hi-hat or crash cymbal.  
- Ride cymbal consistently playing soft and hard open hits on the bell each beat.  
- No toms present.

---

**Request:** Add tom(s) to the groove which has cymbals (ride) already.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add soft tom hits (`o`) to avoid overpowering the delicate ride pattern.  
- Place tom hits on the upbeat (3rd 16th note) of beat 3 (position 11) and on the last 16th note (position 16), giving a rhythmic fill and complement to kick/snare patterns.  
- Leave all other parts unchanged.
