The given groove has kick, snare, and crash cymbal, but no ride cymbal or other cymbals beyond crash. The request is that the groove should have **not only snare but also cymbal**. Since crash cymbal already exists, I can add a ride cymbal pattern to satisfy the request.

---

**Thought process:**

- Keep kick, snare, and crash cymbal as is.
- Add ride cymbal closed hits `x` on steady 8th notes (every two 16th notes) for added cymbal presence.
- Leave tom and hi-hat empty as original.
