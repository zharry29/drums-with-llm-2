The groove already contains several kick hits (`K: O---|---o|O-O-|----`), though one hit is soft (`o` on the second beat). The hi-hat also features a variety of open and closed hits.

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only hi-hat, but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The groove already has kick hits, so no need to add more for presence.  
- Just to solidify the groove, I will strengthen the kick pattern by changing the soft kick on beat 2 (second bar) into a hard kick (`O`).  
- Keep the rest as is, preserving hi-hat expression and snare hits.
