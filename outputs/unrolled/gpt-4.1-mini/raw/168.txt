The original groove already features kick hits prominently and has snare hits that include hard (O) and softer open hits (o), though the snare presence is somewhat light. The hi-hat plays a consistent pattern of closed and open hits. The ride and crash cymbals are not present, which is fine as the request focuses on kick and snare presence.

**Thought process:**

- Since the groove already contains snare hits, I will enhance the snare presence by adding a couple more snare hits for a fuller feel without changing the groove’s character.  
- Keep the kick pattern essentially the same.  
- Keep the hi-hat consistent.  
- No cymbals on crash or ride added, as it’s optional and the request only specifies to include both kick and snare visibly.
