The original groove has kick and toms, but no ride cymbal or hi-hat. The request says the groove should have not only ride but also kick. Kick is present, so I will add a ride cymbal part to fulfill the request and keep the current elements intact.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the kick pattern as is.  
- Keep the tom pattern as is.  
- Add ride cymbal (`x`) on steady 8th notes (every 2 16th notes) for a natural ride feel.  
- Leave snare and hi-hat silent as in original.
