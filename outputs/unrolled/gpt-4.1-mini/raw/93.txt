The original groove already has some hi-hat parts (`H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`), but they seem to vary between soft open (`o`) and hard open (`O`) hits spaced unevenly across beats. The request is to make sure the groove has not only kick but also hi-hat, which essentially means emphasizing or improving hi-hat presence.

**Thought process:**

- The hi-hat is somewhat sparse and has open hits but not a steady closed hi-hat rhythm.
- To strengthen hi-hat presence, I will add a consistent soft closed hi-hat (`x`) on the downbeats or every 8th note for a steady groove.
- I will maintain the original hi-hat open hits as accents on upbeats.
- The kick and snare will remain the same to preserve groove character.
