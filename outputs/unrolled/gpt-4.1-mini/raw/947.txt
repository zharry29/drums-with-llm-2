The request is to remove ride cymbal hits on beat 4 (positions 13-16), while keeping everything else unchanged.

Looking at the Ride cymbal (R) line on beat 4:

- Beat 4: `o-O-` â†’ There is a soft open bell hit ('o') on the 13th 16th note, a hard open bell hit ('O') on the 14th 16th note, and two rests ('-', '-') on the 15th and 16th 16th notes.

We need to replace these four characters with `----` to remove the ride on beat 4.

All other lines remain unchanged.
