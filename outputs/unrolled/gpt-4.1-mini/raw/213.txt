The original groove has kick on beats 1 and 3, snare on beats 2 and 4, and hard closed hi-hat hits ('X') on the first 16th note of each beat. The request is to have not only hi-hat but also cymbal. Since there is no cymbal present, I'll add crash cymbal hits ('O') on the downbeats (first 16th note of beats 1 and 3) to complement the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- Maintain existing kick, snare, and hi-hat structure.  
- Add crash cymbal on strong downbeats for emphasis.
