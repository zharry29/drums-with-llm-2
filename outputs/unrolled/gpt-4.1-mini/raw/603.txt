The original groove:

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a tom hit and cymbal in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Add a hard tom hit "O" at the very first 16th note on the Toms (T) line.
- Add a hard crash cymbal hit "O" at the very first 16th note on the Crash cymbal (C) line.
- Cymbal line currently has "O" hits on the first 16th notes of all four beats â€” since the first one is already present, no change is needed here.
- Tom line currently has no hits in the first position; add an "O" at the first 16th note.
- The snare line has an ambiguous "S" character at measure 3, first character. Since "S" is not a recognized articulation, I will leave it as is since the task doesn't mention changing it.
- Keep other parts unchanged.
