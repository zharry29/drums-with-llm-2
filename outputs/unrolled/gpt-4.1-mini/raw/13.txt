Let's analyze the original groove and think about adding kick hits:

- Kick drum hits currently on:  
  - Beat 1: positions 2 (O) and 3 (O) - So positions 2 and 3 of beat 1  
  - Beat 3: position 12 (O)  
  - Beat 4: positions 14 and 15 (O and O)  
- Snare on beat 3, position 9 (S)  
- Hihat with consistent pattern on every 8th note  
- Tom hits a hard tom on position 12 (overlaps with kick)  
- Crash cymbals on downbeats  

**Request**: Add some kick to the groove.

---

**Thoughts**:

- Kick drum presence is somewhat dense in beat 1 and 4, sparse in beat 2, and sparse in beat 3 (only at 12).

- Add kicks in beat 2 to fill it out: let's add kicks on downbeat (position 5) and on "and" (position 7).

- Add one kick in beat 3 to separate the tom and snare a bit better, on position 10 (“e” of beat 3).

**Kick drum with additions:**

- Beat 1: current O at pos 2 and 3  
- Beat 2: add O on pos 5 and 7  
- Beat 3: add O on pos 10 and keep existing pos 12  
- Beat 4: keep existing kicks on pos 14 and 15  

Notation line (positions 1-16):  
- Beat 1: - O O -  
- Beat 2: O - O -  
- Beat 3: - - O O  
- Beat 4: - O O -

So: -OO-|O-O-|--OO|-OO-
