The original groove has kick, snare, and closed hi-hat hits but no toms.

---

**Request:** Add not only tom but also hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**

- The groove already has hi-hat; itâ€™s closed hi-hat 'X-x-' pattern.
- Add some tom hits to add tom presence while keeping the groove balanced.
- Keep kick, snare, and hi-hat patterns unchanged to preserve the groove.
