The original groove features soft kicks ('o'), snare sidestick hits ('X') sparsely placed, closed hi-hat ('x'), and ride cymbal closed hits ('x' and 'X') with no crash cymbal present. The request is for the groove to have not only cymbal but also snare.

**Thought process:**

- The groove already has snare sidestick hits (soft snare presence), but it's sparse. I'll strengthen the snare presence by adding a few more sidestick hits on backbeats or common snare spots (typically beats 2 and 4).  
- The cymbal is only represented by ride hits, but to enrich cymbal presence, I'll add some crash cymbal hits ('O') on downbeats (beat 1 of bar 1 and bar 3) to add cymbal accents.  
- Maintain the soft kick pattern and hi-hat to preserve groove feel.
