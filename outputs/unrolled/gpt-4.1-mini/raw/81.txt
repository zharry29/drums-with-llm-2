The current groove has:  
- Kick with a varied pattern.  
- Snare with a note marked "S" (likely a typo; I will interpret it as a snare hit `O` on beat 3, first 16th note).  
- Hi-hat consistently playing on alternating 16th notes (`x-x-`).  
- Toms have a single tom hit on the 14th 16th note of the third beat.  
- Crash cymbal on every downbeat (positions 1,5,9,13).  
- No ride cymbal.

---

**Request:** Groove should have **not only cymbal but also tom**.  
There is already a tom hit, but very sparse â€” extend tom presence for the edit.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add more tom hits to create a complementary tom rhythm across the bar while keeping the groove's feel.  
- For example, add tom hits on 6th and 10th 16th notes to emphasize rhythm without overcrowding.  
- Keep all other parts unchanged.
