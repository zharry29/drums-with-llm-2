The original groove features:  
- Kick with hits accented on offbeats and varied syncopation.  
- Snare hits softly on position 11 (third beat).  
- Hihat closed hits on offbeats (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15).  
- Toms on beat 3 "a" (position 12).  
- Crash cymbals on every downbeat (positions 1,5,9,13).  
- No ride cymbal present.

Request: Add some cymbal to the groove.

Thought process:  
- Since crash cymbals are already on all downbeats, a ride cymbal would add a nice rhythmic texture.  
- Add ride cymbal soft closed hits (x) on the "e" and "a" 16th note subdivisions of each beat to complement the groove without overcrowding.  
- Positions for "e" and "a" are 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16.  
- This will give a continuous ride pattern filling the gaps.
