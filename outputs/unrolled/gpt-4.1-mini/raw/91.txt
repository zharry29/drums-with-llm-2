The original groove has:  
- Kick drums playing a busy pattern.  
- Snare hits on the downbeat of beats 2 and 4.  
- Crash cymbals on every downbeat.  
- No hi-hat present.

---

**Request:** Add **hi-hat** to the groove which currently only has kick and cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Adding hi-hat with a steady soft closed hit (`x`) pattern on every 8th note (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15) to complement the existing groove with cymbals and kick.  
- Keep all other parts unchanged.
