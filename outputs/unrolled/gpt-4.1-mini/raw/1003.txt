The request is to play the closed hi-hat on all 8th notes, but open hi-hat on every upbeat, keeping all hits hard.

Recall:  
- Each bar has 16 sixteenth notes.  
- Eighth notes occur on every odd sixteenth note (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15).  
- The quarter note downbeats are positions 1,5,9,13.  
- The upbeats (the "and" of the beat) are positions 3,7,11,15.

Given this:  
- Closed hi-hat "X" on downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13)  
- Open hi-hat "O" on upbeats (positions 3,7,11,15)  
- All other sixteenth notes are silent (“-”).

So the hi-hat line will be:  
`X-O-|X-O-|X-O-|X-O-`

No changes to other lines.
