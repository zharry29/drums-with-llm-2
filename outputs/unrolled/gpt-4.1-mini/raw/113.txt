The original groove has some soft kick hits (`o`) but no tom hits (`T: ----|----|----|----`).

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only tom but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Kick hits are already present but soft and sparse, so I will increase the presence by adding some hard kicks (`O`) at stronger beats.  
- Add tom hits to meet the "not only tom but also kick" requirement.  
- Place soft tom hits complementing the groove without cluttering.  
- Keep other parts (snare, hi-hat, ride) unchanged.
