The request is to remove snare and cymbal hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Snare line (S) has sidestick hits (`X`), so replace them all with `-`.  
- Crash line (C) is empty, so no change.  
- Ride line (R) contains closed hits (`x` and `X`), so replace all with `-`.  
- Kick and hi-hat lines remain as is.
