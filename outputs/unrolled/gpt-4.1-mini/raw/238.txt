The original groove has kick, snare, and ride cymbal patterns but no toms.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits that complement the groove without cluttering it.  
- Placing tom hits on offbeat 16th notes or near snare/kick hits can add nice texture.  
- Keep kick, snare, and ride parts unchanged to preserve the grooveâ€™s feel.
