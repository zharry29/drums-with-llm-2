The request is to remove snare and cymbal hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Snare line (S) is empty, so no change needed.  
- Crash line (C) is empty, so no change needed.  
- Ride line (R) has closed hits (`x` and `X`), so replace all with `-`.  
- Hi-hat (H) contains closed soft hits (`x`), so keep it as is.  
- Kick (K) and Tom (T) lines are empty, so no changes.

Final groove:
