Let's analyze the ride cymbal (R) line:

```
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

Breaking down by beat:

- Beat 1: `x---` → 1st 16th: hard closed bow hit (X lowercase, so actually soft closed bow hit `x`), rest elsewhere  
- Beat 2: `X-x-` →  
  - 1st 16th: hard closed bow hit `X`  
  - 2nd 16th: rest  
  - 3rd 16th: soft closed bow hit `x`  
  - 4th 16th: rest  
- Beat 3: `x---` → same as beat 1  
- Beat 4: `X-x-` → same as beat 2

---

**Goal:** Keep the **same placement** but make the ride cymbal more dynamic.

---

### Thoughts on making it more dynamic:

- Add some variation in articulation (open bell hits `O` or soft open bell `o` to contrast with closed hits).  
- Add extra lighter ghost notes (maybe `x`) in the currently silent 16th note positions near main hits, staying within the same positions.  
- Add some accented or open hits on some "off-positions" within the same beats.

Since the main hits are at the 1st and 3rd 16th notes of beats 1&3, and 1st and 3rd 16th notes of beats 2&4, I can:

- Introduce some soft open bell hits (`o`) on the 2nd or 4th 16ths where there are rests, lightly filling the groove.  
- Alternate 1st 16th hits between hard closed bow `X` and soft open bell `o` to vary.

---

### Proposed ride line edits:

- Beat 1: Change 1st 16th from soft closed bow `x` to soft open bell `o` for a more open sound to start the beat.  
- Beat 2: Keep 1st 16th as hard closed bow `X`, keep 3rd 16th as soft closed bow `x`, add soft open bell `o` on 4th 16th to fill and add dynamics.  
- Beat 3: Like beat 1, 1st 16th as soft open bell `o`.  
- Beat 4: Like beat 2, keep `X` and `x`, and add `o` on 4th 16th.

Result:

```
R: o---|X-xo|o---|X-xo
```
