The original groove features kick, snare, crash cymbal, and hi-hat (opened and closed hits), but no ride or tom hits. The request is to add ride cymbal as well as toms.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add ride cymbal hits on the bow (x/X) or bell (O/o) to complement the groove without overshadowing the hi-hat.  
- Add tom hits (hard hits 'O') in places that fill rhythmic gaps and add melodic interest, such as on off-beats or between kick/snare hits.  
- Keep the existing kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash patterns to maintain the original groove feel.
