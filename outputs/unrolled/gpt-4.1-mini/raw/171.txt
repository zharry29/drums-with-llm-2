The given groove has soft kicks on line K, sidestick snare hits on line S, closed hi-hat hits on line H, and ride cymbal hits on line R. The toms line T is silent, and crash cymbal line C is also silent.

The request says the groove should have not only tom but also cymbal. Since there is no tom hit currently, I will add some tom hits, and I will also add cymbal hits (besides the existing ride).

**Thought process:**  
- Add some tom hits ('O' for hard hit or 'o' for soft hit) in appropriate places to add tom flavor.  
- Add some crash cymbal hits ('O' or 'o') to the crash line to complement cymbal presence.  
- Keep original groove elements intact.
