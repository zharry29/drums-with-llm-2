The "a" of the second beat corresponds to the 4th 16th note in beat 2. Counting 16th notes from 0:

- Beat 1: 0 to 3  
- Beat 2: 4 to 7  
- Beat 3: 8 to 11  
- Beat 4: 12 to 15

Within beat 2:  
- 4 = 1  
- 5 = e  
- 6 = &  
- 7 = a  

So the cymbal hit should be on position 7.

Currently, the Crash (C) and Ride (R) cymbals are:

- C: `O---|----|----|----`  
- R: `----|----|----|----`

I'll add a hard crash cymbal hit "O" on position 7 in the second beat in the crash cymbal line. The second beat segment for C is `----`, so it becomes `---O`.
