The original groove:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a tom hit and cymbal in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Add a tom hit (hard hit "O") at the very first 16th note in the Toms (T) line.
- Add a cymbal hit at the very first 16th note. Since Crash cymbal (C) and Ride cymbal (R) are available, and the request is "cymbal" (unspecified), the better choice is Crash cymbal (C) for an accent at the start.
- Add a hard crash cymbal hit "O" at the very first 16th note on the Crash cymbal (C) line.
- Leave other lines unchanged.
