The original groove features kick, snare, and toms, but no hi-hat or ride cymbal. The edit requests the groove includes both hi-hat and ride. Since neither is present, Iâ€™ll add both while keeping the existing parts intact.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep kick, snare, tom patterns unchanged.  
- Add a steady closed hi-hat pattern (`x`) on every 8th note (every 2 sixteenth notes).  
- Add a ride cymbal closed pattern (`x`) on every 8th note as well, alternating slightly with hi-hat for texture.
