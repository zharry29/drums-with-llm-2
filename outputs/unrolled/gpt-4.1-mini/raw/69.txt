The original groove currently has:  
- Kick drum with hits on beats 1, 4, and parts of 3.  
- Snare with varied articulation (hard and soft open hits).  
- Ride cymbal with bell hits (soft and hard alternation every beat).  
- No hi-hat present.  
- No toms or crash cymbal either.

---

**Request:** Groove should have **not only ride but also hi-hat**.  
We already have ride cymbal, so we must add hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add a hi-hat pattern that complements the groove, possibly playing steady 8th note soft closed hits (`x`) on the offbeats (positions 3,7,11,15) to fill the rhythmic space.  
- Keep ride cymbal as is, since it's already part of the groove.  
- Do not change existing kick, snare, or other parts.

Final hi-hat line:  
`--x-|--x-|--x-|--x-`
