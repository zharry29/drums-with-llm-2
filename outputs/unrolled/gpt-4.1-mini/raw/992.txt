The request is to add closed hi-hat hits on every 16th note in the bar, with accents on the quarter note downbeats (the first 16th note of each beat).  

Notation reminder for hi-hat:  
- `X` = hard closed hit (accented)  
- `x` = soft closed hit (unaccented)

Since the downbeats (positions 1, 5, 9, 13) should be accented, they get `X`. The other 16th notes get `x`.

Original hi-hat line is empty:  
`----|----|----|----`

Now fill all 16 positions:  

Positions in full bar, 16 total:

1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 | 9 10 11 12 | 13 14 15 16  
X x x x | X x x x | X  x  x  x  | X  x  x  x  

Other instruments remain unchanged.
