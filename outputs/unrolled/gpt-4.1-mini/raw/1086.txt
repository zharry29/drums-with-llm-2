To make the groove sound more like metal, here are the typical changes I will apply:

- Kick drum: Use steady, fast 16th note kicks, often double kicks.

- Snare drum: Strong hard hits (O) on beats 2 and 4 with occasional ghost hits or rests.

- Hi-hat or Ride: Add constant hi-hat or ride 16th notes hits with hard closed hits (X) or ride bow hits to keep the pulse aggressive.

- Toms: Use tom hits selectively, usually for fills or accents.

- Crash cymbal: Often used as an accent on beat 1 or transitions.

Given the original groove is:

```
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

---

### Edit plan:

- Kick: Change to steady 16th notes for the first two beats; then double kicks on beat 3 and 4.

- Snare: Hard snare hit on beat 3 (as original), add ghost snare on 16th note before main hits.

- Hi-hat: Add steady hard closed hits (X) 16th notes throughout.

- Tom: Remove for cleaner metal groove or accent sparsely.

- Crash or ride: Leave silent or add if needed.

### Final groove:

```
K: OOOO|OOOO|OO--|OOO-
S: ----|o-o-|O---|----  
H: XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----
```
