Let's analyze the original groove:

```
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

We need to add an **open hihat on the last 8th note**.

- The last 8th note corresponds to the 15th and 16th 16th notes of the bar.
- Each bar has 16 16th notes divided as four groups of 4 characters.
- The last group (positions 13-16) on the hihat line is currently `----`.
- The 15th 16th note corresponds to the third character in the last group.
- To add an open hihat there, we replace the 15th position character from `-` to `o` (soft open hihat).

Thus the last group of the hihat line becomes `--o-`.
