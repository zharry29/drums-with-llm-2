The current groove consists of:  
- Kick playing a strong, driving pattern with many hits.  
- Snare hits on beats 2 and 4 downbeats.  
- Crash cymbal hitting on every beat downbeat (positions 1,5,9,13 â€” the first 16th note of each beat).  
- No hi-hat or ride cymbal.

---

**Request:** Groove already has crash cymbals but the request emphasizes "not only kick but also cymbal," so the cymbals should be present.

Since the crashes are already there, the groove is fine in terms of cymbals. However, to enhance the cymbal presence, I could:  
- Add a ride cymbal pattern on the offbeats with soft closed hits (`x`) to add texture and keep it moving.

---

**Plan:**  
Add ride cymbal (`R`) soft closed hits on the offbeat 8th notes (position 3,7,11,15).

Final ride cymbal line:  
`--x-|--x-|--x-|--x-`
