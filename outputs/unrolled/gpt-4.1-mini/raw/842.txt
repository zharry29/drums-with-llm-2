The original groove:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
```

Request: "I'd like a kick hit and cymbal in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Kick (K) at the very beginning (first 16th note) is 'O' (hard hit), so already present.
- Cymbal: Crash (C) currently has no hits; Ride (R) has a soft open bell hit 'o' at the first 16th note.
- To add an accent cymbal "hit" in the beginning, adding a Crash cymbal hard hit 'O' at the first 16th note is appropriate.
- Other lines remain unchanged.
