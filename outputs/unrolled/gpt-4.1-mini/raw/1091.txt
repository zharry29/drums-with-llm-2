To make this groove more metal-like, I’ll focus on these points:

- **Kick:** Metal often features fast, steady 16th-note kick patterns, often double-kick pedal driven. I’ll convert the scattered kick hits into a consistent, powerful pattern.

- **Snare:** Metal snares hit hard on beats 2 and 4 with possible ghost notes for groove and complexity.

- **Hi-hat:** Typically constant 16th-note hard closed hits (`X`), sometimes open hits for accents. I’ll use steady hard closed hits.

- **Toms:** Usually used for fills or accents; here I’ll keep them silent for the basic groove.

- **Crash and Ride:** Not present here; no changes needed.

**Original groove:**

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

---

**Plan:**

- Kick: steady 16th notes with hard hits (`O`).

- Snare: hard hits on beats 2 and 4 (`O`), ghost notes (`o`) just before main hits.

- Hi-hat: constant hard closed hits (`X`).
