The original groove features soft kicks, snare sidesticks, closed hi-hats, and ride cymbal hits, but no toms.

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only tom but also ride.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Ride cymbal is already present, so keep it as is.  
- Add some subtle tom hits to incorporate toms into the groove without overpowering other elements.  
- Preserve kick, snare, hi-hat, and ride patterns.
