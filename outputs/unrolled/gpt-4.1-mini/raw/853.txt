The original groove:

```
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a tom hit and hihat in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Tom (T) at the very beginning already has a soft tom hit 'O' on the first 16th note. So the tom hit is already present.
- Hihat (H) at the very beginning is currently '-', no hit. Add a soft closed hihat hit 'x' at the first 16th note for a gentle texture.
- Other lines remain unchanged.
