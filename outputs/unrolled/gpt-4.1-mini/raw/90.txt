The original groove has:  
- Kick playing soft hits on some downbeats and offbeats.  
- Snare playing hard sidesticks on some offbeats.  
- Hi-hat almost silent except two soft closed hits on offbeats.  
- No crash or ride cymbals.  
- Request is the groove should have **not only kick but also hi-hat**.

**Thought process:**  
- The groove already has some minimal hi-hat, but it's very sparse.  
- To fulfill the request, I will add a steady hi-hat pattern to add rhythmic texture.  
- Use soft closed hi-hat hits (`x`) on every 8th note (every 2 16th notes) for groove stability. That means positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15.  
- Keep original kick, snare, and ride as is.
