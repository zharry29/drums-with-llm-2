The original groove has no kick (`K:` line is empty) and no toms (`T:` line is empty). It does have a ride pattern and some hi-hat hits.

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only tom but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add kick hits to create rhythmic foundation.  
- Add tom hits as well to fulfill the "not only tom but also kick" condition.  
- Keep existing hi-hat and ride pattern unchanged.
