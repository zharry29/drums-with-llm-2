The original groove features aggressive kick patterns, snare hits, crashes every bar, but no tom or ride cymbal hits. The request is to add both ride cymbal and tom hits.

**Thought process:**  
- Add some tom hits (hard hits 'O') to add melodic/rhythmic interest, probably in the latter part of the bar or between kicks.  
- Add ride cymbal hits (typically closed bow 'x' or bell hits 'O') to provide ride presence.  
- Keep the crash cymbals and kick/snare patterns as is to keep the groove intact.
