The original groove is:

```
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Request: "I'd like a kick hit and tom in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Kick (K) at the very beginning (first 16th note) is already 'O', so no change needed.
- Tom (T) at the very beginning (first 16th note) is 'O' (hard hit), so also no change needed.
- Other lines remain unchanged.

Because the request is already satisfied by the original groove, we don't need to make any changes.

Final groove:
