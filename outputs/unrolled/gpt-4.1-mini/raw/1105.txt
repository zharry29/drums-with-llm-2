To add more low frequency sounds to the groove, I will strengthen the kick drum presence and introduce some tom hits, as both provide low-end energy.

- The kicks currently hit on positions 0, 3, and 10.

- To add more low frequency impact, I'll add kicks on some off-beats and also add tom hits on some off-beats to fill out the sound.

**Changes:**

- Add kicks on the "and" of beat 2 (6th 16th note) and the "and" of beat 4 (14th 16th note).

- Add tom hits on the "e" and "a" of beat 3 (9th and 12th 16th notes).
