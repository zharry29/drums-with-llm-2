The original groove currently has no snare or kick hits, only closed hi-hat and ride cymbal patterns.

The edit request wants the groove to have not only snare but also kick, so I need to add both snare and kick hits.

**Thought process:**

- Add kick on 1 and 3 beats (typical foundation).  
- Add snare hits on 2 and 4 beats to complement the kick and form the basic backbeat.  
- Keep the hi-hat and ride cymbal pattern as is for continuity.
