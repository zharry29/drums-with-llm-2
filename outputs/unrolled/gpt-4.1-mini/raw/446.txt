The original groove:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

Request: "I don't want any cymbal or snare."

- Snare (S) line is already empty.
- Cymbals include Crash (C), Ride (R), and often Hihat (H) is considered a cymbal.
- Crash (C) is empty.
- Ride (R) line has closed hits 'x' and 'X'; will clear it.
- Hihat (H) line has soft closed hits 'x'; will clear it as well.
- Other lines remain unchanged.
