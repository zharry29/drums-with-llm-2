The original groove includes kick, snare, and crash cymbal, but no hi-hat or ride cymbal. The request asks for a groove with not only hi-hat but also ride, so I will add a hi-hat and a ride cymbal pattern while preserving kick, snare, and crash.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the kick, snare, and crash as originally written.  
- Add a steady closed hi-hat (`x`) pattern on all quarter note 16th notes to complement the groove.  
- Add a ride cymbal (`x`) pattern on every off-beat 8th note for texture.
