The original groove has a kick pattern, hi-hat, crash cymbal on each downbeat, and a tom hit noted at the 3rd beat last 16th note. The snare line contains an 'S', which is not a valid notation according to the legend â€” it should be replaced or removed.

The request is to ensure the groove has not only kick but also tom.

**Thought process:**  
- The groove already has tom hits in bar 3 (third beat last 16th note). To emphasize tom, add an additional tom hit in bar 1 or 2 to complement the rhythm.  
- Remove the invalid 'S' on snare line and keep snare empty since the request does not ask for snare addition.  
- Keep the rest of the groove intact.
