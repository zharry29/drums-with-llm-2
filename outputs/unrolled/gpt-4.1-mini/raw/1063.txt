Let's analyze the kick (K) line:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
```

Kick hits are on:

- Beat 1: 1st 16th note (hard hit `O`)

- Beat 2: no kicks

- Beat 3: 1st 16th note (hard hit `O`)

- Beat 4: no kicks

---

**Goal:** Keep the same placement but make the kick more dynamic.

---

### How to add dynamics?

- Vary velocity by changing some hard hits `O` into soft hits `o`.

- For example, soften the second kick at beat 3.

### New kick line:

```
K: O---|----|o---|----
```
