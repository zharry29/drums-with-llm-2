The original groove has kick, snare, hi-hat, and crash, but no tom hits.

The request is to add toms alongside the snare and kick pattern.

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits that complement the groove without clutter â€” place toms on offbeats or in between existing hits.  
- Use hard tom hits ('O') to give presence but keep the groove balanced.  
- Keep existing parts unchanged except adding toms.
