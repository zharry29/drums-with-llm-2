To make this groove sound like a metal groove, I will:

- Use steady, fast kick drum 16th notes with hard hits (`O`) to give power.

- Add snare hard hits (`O`) on the 2nd and 4th beats, with some ghost hits (`o`) for groove.

- Change the hi-hat pattern to continuous hard closed hits (`X`) 16th notes to drive the rhythm.

- Keep ride cymbal pattern more aggressive with hard closed (`X`) hits, more frequent and consistent.

- Toms and crash stay silent as requested.

**Original groove:**

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

**Edited metal groove (16 16th notes):**

- Kick: `O` on all 16th notes.

- Snare: `O` on 2 and 4, ghost hits `o` before snare hits.

- Hi-hat: `X` on all 16th notes.

- Ride: consistent `X`, matching hi-hat pattern for heaviness.
