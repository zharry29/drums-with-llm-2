The original groove:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Edit request: "I'd like a kick hit and ride in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Very beginning means the first 16th note.
- Kick (K) first character is already "O" (hard hit), so kick is present.
- Ride (R) first character is "-", so add a hard closed hit "X" on the bow according to notation for closed ride hits.
- Keep other parts unchanged.
