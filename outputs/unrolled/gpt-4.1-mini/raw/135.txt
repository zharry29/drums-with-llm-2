The original groove has kick, snare, and crash cymbal, but no toms and no hi-hat.

---

**Request:** Add not only tom but also hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add some tom hits to introduce toms.  
- Add closed hi-hat hits on steady 8th notes to provide rhythm and fill the groove.  
- Keep existing kick, snare, and crash as is.
