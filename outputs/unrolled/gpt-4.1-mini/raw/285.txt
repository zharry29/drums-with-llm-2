The original groove has ride cymbal hits (closed bow hits) and hi-hat closed hits, but no snare or kick. The edit request requires the groove to have not only snare but also ride. Since the groove lacks snare, I will add a snare pattern while keeping the ride and hi-hat intact.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add snare hits (`O` or `o`) on the classic backbeats (beats 2 and 4) to complement ride and hi-hat.  
- Keep ride cymbal pattern as is.  
- No kick requested, so leave kicked silent.
