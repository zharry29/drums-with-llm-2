The original groove already has kick drum hits (K line) distributed across the bar, as well as cymbal hits (C line). The edit request asks for the groove to have not only cymbal but also kick, so it seems the kick should be emphasized or added more clearly.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The current kick pattern is somewhat sparse and soft at some spots.  
- I'll reinforce the kick pattern to make it more explicit or consistent while keeping the existing cymbal and the groove feel.  
- Retain snare and hi-hat pattern as is.
