The original hihat pattern is:

```
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
```

This means there's a hard closed hihat hit (`X`) on the first 16th note of each beat.

To keep the same placement but make it more dynamic, I can vary the articulation by mixing hard and soft hits (`X` and `x`), or alternate between closed and open hits (`X` and `O`), adding dynamics without changing the timing.

I'll alternate between hard closed (`X`) and soft closed (`x`) hits on the first 16th note of each beat, and occasionally add a soft open hit (`o`) right after to create more texture:

- Beat 1: `X---` → `Xo--` (hard closed + soft open)  
- Beat 2: `X---` → `x---` (soft closed only)  
- Beat 3: `X---` → `Xo--`  
- Beat 4: `X---` → `x---`

Full new hihat pattern:

```
H: Xo--|x---|Xo--|x---
```

This keeps the placement and adds dynamic contrast.
