The groove already contains hi-hat parts, but all are either open (O, o). The request is to add some hi-hat, which usually refers to closed hi-hat hits (X or x) for rhythmic definition.

**Thought process:**  
- The current hi-hat is mostly open and soft open hits on the “and” subdivisions.  
- I will add some soft closed hi-hat hits (‘x’) on the downbeat 16th notes (positions 1, 5, 9, 13) to add a steady pulse underneath the open hits.  
- This will create more rhythmic drive and complement the open hi-hat hits.

Hi-hat line updated:  
Positions 1,5,9,13 = x (soft closed)  
Positions 3,4,7,8,11,12,15,16 = keep as in original (mostly O or o)  

So: For the first beat (positions 1-4): x (new), -, o, -  
Second beat: x (new), O, -, o  
Third beat: x (new), O, -, o  
Fourth beat: x (new), O, -, o

Final hi-hat line:

`x-o-|xO-o|xO-o|xO-o`
