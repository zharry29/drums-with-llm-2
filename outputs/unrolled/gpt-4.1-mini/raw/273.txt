The given groove already has kick and crash cymbal, but no ride cymbal. The request asks to have not only ride but also kick. So I will add a ride cymbal pattern while keeping the kick present.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the kick drum hits as is.  
- Keep the crash cymbal as is.  
- Add ride cymbal hits (`x`) on eighth notes (every second 16th note) to fill the ride role.
