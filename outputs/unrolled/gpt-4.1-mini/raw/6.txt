The original groove has:  
- Kick on beat 1 of bars 1 and 3  
- Snare hits on beat 2 and 4 (downbeat of the second and fourth beats)  
- Hihat plays hard closed hits on downbeats of all beats  
- No toms, crashes, or rides  

To add toms that complement the existing rhythm without cluttering:  
- The groove is straightforward; tom hits can add some flavor primarily in the middle beats (2 and 3).  
- I'll add some soft tom hits on offbeats (16th notes) just after the snare on beat 2 and before beat 3.  
- And a hard tom hit as a lead into beat 4 for some accent.

Mapping 16th note positions (1-16):  
- Beat 1: 1-4  
- Beat 2: 5-8  
- Beat 3: 9-12  
- Beat 4: 13-16  

Plan for toms:  
- Soft tom hits 'o' at position 6 ("e" of beat 2) and position 11 ("e" of beat 3)  
- Hard tom hit 'O' at position 14 ("e" of beat 4) to give a stronger accent leading to beat 4
