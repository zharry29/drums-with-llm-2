The original groove already features kick and hi-hat, but the hi-hat hits are only on the first 16th note of each beat (`X---|X---|X---|X---`), so it's a very sparse hi-hat pattern.

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only kick but also hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Increase hi-hat presence by making it more consistent and dynamic.  
- Add soft closed hi-hat hits `x` on the off 16th notes to create a steady and groovy hi-hat pattern.  
- Keep kick and snare as is.
