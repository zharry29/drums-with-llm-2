The original groove already includes kick hits on the K line (`O--O|----|--O-|----`), but the snare is quite busy with soft open hits and ghost notes (`Oo-o`, `-o--`, `O--o`). The edit request asks to have not only snare but also kick, so to balance this groove better, I can add a few more kick hits between the existing ones to emphasize the kick more.

**Thought process:**  
- Maintain the existing snare pattern as is.  
- Add a few soft kick hits (`o`) to fill in the quieter spaces and support the snare hits.
