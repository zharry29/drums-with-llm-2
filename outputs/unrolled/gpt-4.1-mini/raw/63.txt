The current groove has:  
- Kick pattern with some variety, notably soft and hard hits.  
- Snare line contains "S" which is invalid notation, replace it with a snare hit "O".  
- Hi-hat has some closed soft hits (`x`) on the offbeats.  
- Crash cymbals on downbeats (positions 1, 5, 9, 13).  
- No ride cymbal (R) hits at all — despite the previous mention in the instructions, here the ride line is empty.

---

**Request:**  
The groove should have not only ride but also hi-hat.  
Currently, no ride hits at all, but hi-hat already has hits. So I will add ride cymbal pattern.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep hi-hat as is.  
- Add ride cymbal with steady closed hits on downbeats (positions 1,5,9,13) or a slightly syncopated pattern to complement the groove.  
- Use soft closed bow hits (`x`) on the ride to not overshadow the crash cymbal.

Final ride cymbal line:  
`x---|x---|x---|x---`

---

Also fix the snare line "S" → "O".
