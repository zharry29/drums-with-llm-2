The original groove has:  
- Kick with many hits clustered mostly on beats 1 and 3.  
- Snare only on beat 2 and 4 downbeats.  
- Crash cymbal on every downbeat.  
- No hihat or toms or ride cymbal.

**Request:** Add some snare to the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- Currently snare hits are on downbeats 2 and 4 only (positions 6 and 14). Adding ghost or soft snare hits on the "e" and "a" subdivisions of these beats will add rhythmic interest.  
- Positions for "e" and "a" in those beats:  
  - Beat 2: positions 6 (currently O) and 8 — add soft snare on 8 (o)  
  - Beat 4: positions 14 (currently O) and 16 — add soft snare on 16 (o)  
- Leave hard snare hits on 6 and 14 as is.
