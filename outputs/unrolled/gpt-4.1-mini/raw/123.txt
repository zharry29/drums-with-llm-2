The original groove contains only ride cymbal hits (`R:` line) and hi-hat soft closed hits (`H:`), but no crash cymbal hits (`C:` line empty).

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only ride but also cymbal (crash).

---

**Thought process:**

- Keep the ride pattern as is for feel.  
- Add some crash cymbal hits on downbeats (e.g. on beats 1 and 3) to complement ride cymbal line.  
- Keep other parts as is (no kick, snare or toms).
