The request is to fill the whole bar with a double kick pattern. Double kick typically means having two kick hits closely spaced in each beat (usually on the 1st and 3rd 16th note positions of every beat).

Original Kick line:  
`O---|---o|O-O-|----`  
Positions with kicks:  
- Beat 1: position 1 hard hit (O)  
- Beat 2: position 7 soft hit (o)  
- Beat 3: positions 9 and 11 hard hits (O-O)  
- Beat 4: no kick

To fill the whole bar with double kick, I will place two hard kick hits (`O`) in each beat on positions 1 & 3, 5 & 7, 9 & 11, and 13 & 15.

Other parts (S, H, C, R, T) remain unchanged.
