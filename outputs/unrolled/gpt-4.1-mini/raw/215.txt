The original groove includes kick, snare, hi-hat (soft open 'o' and open 'O'), and a crash cymbal hit on the first beat of the first bar. Since the request is for the groove to have not only hi-hat but also cymbal, and there is already a crash cymbal hit on the downbeat of the first bar, I will add some additional cymbal presence to balance with the lively hi-hat pattern.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the existing kick, snare, and hi-hat parts untouched to preserve feel.  
- Add ride cymbal closed hits ('x') on the off-beats as an additional cymbal component to complement the crash cymbal and add texture.  
- Place ride cymbal hits on upbeat 16ths (e.g., 2nd and 4th sixteenth notes of each beat).
