The original groove has kick, snare, and toms but no hi-hat or cymbal (crash/ride). The request is to have not only cymbal but also hi-hat, so I will add a cymbal and also introduce hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add crash cymbal hits (`O`) on downbeats to provide cymbal texture.  
- Add closed hi-hat hits (`x`) on every 8th note to provide a steady rhythm.  
- Keep the kick, snare, and toms intact.  
- Leave the ride line empty since the request only mentions cymbal (likely crash) and hi-hat.
