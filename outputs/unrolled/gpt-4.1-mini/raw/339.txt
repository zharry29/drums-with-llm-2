The request is to remove all hi-hat and tom hits.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The hi-hat line (H) contains soft and hard closed hits (`x`), so replace all of them with `-`.  
- The tom line (T) contains a hard hit (`O`) on the third beat of the third bar, so replace it with `-`.  
- Keep kick, snare, crash, and ride lines as they are.
