The original groove has kick, snare, and toms but no cymbal. The request is to have not only snare but also cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**
- Keep kick, snare, and toms as is.
- Add cymbal hits to complement the groove. The crash cymbal (`O`) would be impactful but to keep it steady throughout, ride cymbal closed hits (`x`) can be added on 8th notes for consistent cymbal presence.
