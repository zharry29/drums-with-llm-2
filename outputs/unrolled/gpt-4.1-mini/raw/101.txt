The given groove already contains kick drum hits:

- Kicks are played on a syncopated and busy pattern.
- The hi-hat has a steady pattern of soft closed hits (`x`), consistent on every other 16th note.
- There is a crash cymbal on each first 16th note of every beat.
- Snare has an unusual character "S" which is not defined in the instructions, so it looks like a mistake.

---

**Request:** Groove should have not only hi-hat but also kick.

**Thought process:**

- Since kick is already present, likely the "S" is a mistake, so I will transform that snare part into correct notation (no snare).
- The hi-hat is already present well so no change needed.
- Keep all else unchanged.
