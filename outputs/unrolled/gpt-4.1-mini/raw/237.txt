The original groove has soft kicks (`o`), snare sidesticks (`X`), hi-hat soft closed hits (`x`), and ride cymbal closed hits (`x` and `X`), but no toms.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add tom hits to the groove, placing them where they complement the existing rhythm without clutter.  
- Using soft tom hits (`o`) to blend well with the soft dynamics of the kicks and hi-hat.  
- Place tom hits on the second measure and last measure in a way that adds rhythmic interest.
