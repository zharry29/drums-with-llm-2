The original groove has:  
- Kick with soft hits on some downbeats and offbeats.  
- Snare with hard sidestick hits on offbeats.  
- Hi-hat with soft closed hits sparsely on offbeats.  
- Ride cymbal playing a soft/hard closed pattern on the bow.  
- No toms at all.

---

**Request:** Add tom hits to complement the existing groove with cymbal and ride.

---

**Thought process:**  
- To integrate toms smoothly without overcrowding, I'll add soft tom hits (`o`) on offbeat 16th notes where there are no snare or kick hits to maintain groove balance.  
- Positions 11 and 15 (the "and" of beats 3 and 4) seem good spots to add toms, adding some rhythmic flavor near the groove's end.  
- Keep all other parts unchanged to preserve the groove feel.
