The request is to remove kick drum hits on beat 4 (positions 13-16) but leave everything else unchanged.

Looking at the kick drum line (K) on beat 4:

- Beat 4: `O---` â†’ there is a hard kick on the first 16th note of beat 4.

We replace these four characters with `----` to remove the kick on beat 4.

All other lines remain unchanged.
