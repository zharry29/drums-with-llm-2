To transform this groove into a metal style, let's consider some typical metal drumming characteristics:

- Fast double kick pedal patterns or steady 16th note kicks.

- Aggressive snare hits on the backbeat.

- Use of ride cymbal or crash accents.

- More constant hi-hat or ride pattern with hard closed hits.

- Possibly tom and snare fills and more intense accents.

### Original groove analysis:

```
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

- Kick is somewhat syncopated with triplet feel (?).

- Snare on 2nd and 4th beats, soft pattern.

- Crash on beat 1 of each bar.

- No hi-hat or ride pattern.

---

### Changes for metal:

- Kick: steady rapid 16th notes or driving double kick pattern.

- Snare: hard hits on beats 2 and 4 with sidestick fills or ghost notes.

- Hi-hat: constant 16th note hard closed hits (`X`).

- Crash: accent on first beat, plus some rests.

- Possibly some tom rolls for intensity.

---

### Proposed metal groove:

- Kick: steady 16th notes for the first two beats, then drive to 8th notes

- Snare: hard hits on beats 2 and 4 (`O`), with some ghost notes (`o`) around.

- Hi-hat: steady hard closed 16th notes (`X`).

- Crash: first beat only.

### Final notation:

```
K: OOOO|OOOO|--OO|OOOO
S: ----|O--o|----|O---
H: XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```
