The request is to reduce the number of notes in the groove, simplifying it while maintaining its character.

Current groove details and reduction plan:

- **Kick (K):** Current hits at positions 2,5,6,10,13,15. To simplify, keep only the strong downbeats and omit some in between.
- **Snare (S):** One note at position 11 ('S'). We can remove it to simplify or keep if important.
- **Hihat (H):** Repeated closed hits (`x`) on every beat subdivision. We can reduce the pattern to hits on just the downbeats (first 16th note of each beat).
- **Toms (T):** One hard hit at position 11. To simplify, remove it.
- **Crash (C):** Hits on the downbeat of each beat. To simplify, keep only the first one.
- **Ride (R):** No hits, no change needed.

Edited groove:

- Kick: Keep hits on positions 2 and 10 (beats 1.2 and 3.2).
- Snare: Remove the single hit.
- Hihat: Keep only the first 16th note of each beat (positions 1,5,9,13).
- Toms: Remove the hit.
- Crash: Keep only the first hit (position 1).
