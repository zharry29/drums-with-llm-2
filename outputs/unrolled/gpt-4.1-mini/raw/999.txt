The request is to play the closed hi-hat on all 16th notes, accenting the quarter note downbeats.  

Hi-hat notation:  
- `X` = hard closed hit (accent on downbeat)  
- `x` = soft closed hit (non-accent)

Quarter note downbeats fall on positions 1, 5, 9, and 13 of the 16 character line. These get `X`, and the other 16th notes get `x`.

The original hi-hat line:  
`--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`

Since `O` or `o` represent open hi-hats, we need to replace these with closed hits as per the request.

Replacing all positions with closed hi-hat hits, accented on quarter notes:

Positions 1,5,9,13 = `X`  
Other positions = `x`

This makes the hi-hat line:  
`Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx`

Other instruments remain unchanged.
