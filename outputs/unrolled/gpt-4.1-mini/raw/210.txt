The original groove has kick, snare, and ride cymbal (bell) hits, but no hi-hat or crash cymbal. The edit request wants the groove to have both hi-hat and cymbal.

Since ride cymbal (R) cymbals are already present, I will add a hi-hat pattern to introduce that component, keeping the ride as is for cymbal presence.

**Thought process:**  
- Add a steady closed hi-hat pattern ('x') at every 8th note (or consistent 16th notes) for groove drive.  
- Keep kick, snare, ride intact to preserve feel.  
- No crash cymbal added, as ride is already the cymbal component here.
