The original groove's kick pattern:

- Kick hits on beat 1 (pos 1) and beat 3 (pos 9) only.

- Snare hits on beat 2 (pos 6) and beat 4 (pos 14).

- Hihat closed hard hits on downbeats (pos 1,5,9,13).

---

**Request:** Add some kick to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**

- Given kick hits only on beats 1 and 3, adding kicks on "and" of beat 1 and 3 (positions 3 and 11) will add groove without overcrowding.

- Also add a soft kick on the "and" of beat 2 (position 7) â€” to complement snare on beat 2.

- Added kicks: positions 3 (O), 7 (o), 11 (O).

New kick line: positions (1,3,7,9,11) with O for hard kicks except soft kick at pos 7 (o):

K: O-O-|--o-|O---|----
