The original groove already has kick drum hits (`K: O---|O---|----|O---`), but no hi-hat hits at all.

---

**Request:** Groove should include not only hi-hat but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Kick is already present, so I will keep it as is.  
- Add a steady soft closed hi-hat pattern (`x`) on every 8th note (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15) for a solid hi-hat presence.  
- Leave snare and toms as is.
