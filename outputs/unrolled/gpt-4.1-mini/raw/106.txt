The original groove already has a very dense kick pattern (many `O`s) and crash cymbals on every first 16th note of each beat, but it completely lacks any hi-hat hits.

---

**Request:** Add a hi-hat pattern so the groove includes not only kick but also hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the existing kick pattern as it is because itâ€™s already full.  
- Add a steady closed hi-hat pattern with soft hits (`x`) on every 8th note (positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15) to provide rhythm and complement the dense kick.  
- Leave all other parts unchanged.
