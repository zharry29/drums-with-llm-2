"Feathering" the kick drum typically means playing softer, subtler kick hits, often replacing hard hits (`O`) with soft hits (`o`) or adding softer ghost notes around the main hits.

In this groove:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
```

Kick hits are on the 1st beat (position 1) and 3rd beat (position 9), both hard hits (`O`).

To feather the kicks, change the hard hits (`O`) to soft hits (`o`).

Final kick line:

```
K: o---|----|o---|----
```

Other lines remain unchanged.
