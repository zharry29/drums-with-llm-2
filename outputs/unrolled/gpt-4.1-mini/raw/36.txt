The original groove features:

- Kick pattern with several hits on beats 1, 3, and syncopated spots.

- Snare combines hard and soft hits around beats 2 and 4 with some offbeats.

- Hihat with alternating hard and soft closed hits every 8th (x-x-) across the bar.

- No toms, crash, or ride.

---

**Request:** Add some ride to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**

- The ride cymbal usually gives a steady pulse or accents in a groove.

- The ride notation uses O (hard open bell hit), o (soft open bell hit), X, x (hard/soft closed hits on the bow).

- To maintain clarity and groove, I'll add ride cymbal on the downbeats (positions 1, 5, 9, 13) with a hard bell hit 'O'.

- Additionally, put softer ride bell hits 'o' on the offbeat 16th notes (positions 3,7,11,15) to add swing feel.

- Leave other positions empty for spacing and clarity.
