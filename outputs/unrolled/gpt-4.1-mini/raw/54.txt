The original groove has:  
- Kick on various syncopated 16th notes.  
- Snare playing a mix of open and soft hits.  
- Hi-hat playing a steady alternating hard and soft closed pattern.  
- No cymbal present currently.

---

**Request:** Add cymbal to the groove (in addition to kick).

---

**Thought process:**  
- To complement the existing groove, adding a crash cymbal hit on the downbeat of beat 1 (position 1) and beat 3 (position 9) will add energy without overcrowding.  
- I will use a hard crash hit 'O' on these downbeats.
