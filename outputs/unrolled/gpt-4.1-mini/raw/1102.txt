To add more low frequency sounds, I will enhance the kick drum presence and possibly add some tom hits, since kicks and toms contribute to the low end.

Current groove:

- Kick plays mostly on beats 1, "and" of beat 2 (soft), and a pattern on beat 3.

- Snare hits on beats 2 and 4.

- Hi-hat open and soft hits on sixteenths.

No toms, just sparse kicks.

---

**Plan:**

- Add extra kick hits to fill in some 16th notes, particularly around beats 2 and 4 to add low-end density.

- Add tom hits on off-beats to fill out lower mids.

---

**Changes:**

- Add kicks on the 'e' subdivision (2nd 16th) of beat 1 and the 'a' subdivision (4th 16th) of beat 4.

- Add tom hits on 'a' subdivision of beat 1 and 'e' subdivision of beat 3.

**Final groove:**
