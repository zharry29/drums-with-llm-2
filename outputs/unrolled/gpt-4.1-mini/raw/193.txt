The original groove has kick and toms with soft and hard hits, and occasional snare hits on beats 3 of bars 3 and 4. The task is to have not only tom but also snare, so I will enhance the snare presence a bit.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add some snare hits on typical backbeats (2 and 4) to complement the groove.  
- Keep tom hits as they are.  
- Maintain the kick drum pattern unchanged.  
- Keep other parts like crash and ride as empty since none present originally or requested.
