The original groove:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

Request: "I'd like a kick hit and cymbal in the very beginning."

Step-by-step:

- Kick (K) at the very beginning is '-', so add a hard kick hit 'O' at the first 16th note.
- Cymbal: possible lines are Crash (C) or Ride (R). Ride is already playing some notes at start (soft closed hits 'x'), but the request is to add cymbal at the very beginning.
- Since Ride already has a soft closed bow hit 'x' at first note, adding Crash cymbal 'O' at first 16th note would add a cymbal accent.
- Alternatively, could add Crash or a Ride bell hit 'O'.
- Choose Crash cymbal hard hit 'O' at the first 16th note for clarity.
- Other lines remain unchanged.
