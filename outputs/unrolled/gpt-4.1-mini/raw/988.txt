The original groove has kick hits (soft `o`) on positions 2, 6, 10, and 14.

Request: Fill the whole bar with double kick, meaning two kicks per beat, usually on the 1st and 3rd 16th notes of each beat.

Thus, for each beat: positions 1 & 3, 5 & 7, 9 & 11, 13 & 15 should have kicks.

I will put hard kicks (`O`) in those positions for clarity and presence.

Other instruments (S, H, R) remain unchanged.
