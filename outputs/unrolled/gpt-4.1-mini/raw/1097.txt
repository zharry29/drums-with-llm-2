To add more low frequency sounds, the best options are to add kick drum hits and possibly some tom hits, since those produce deeper tones than hi-hat or ride cymbals.

---

**Current groove:**

- Kick drum: silent

- Toms: silent

- Hi-hat: soft closed hits (`x`) on 2nd beat and 4th beat first 16th note

- Ride: soft closed hits (`x`, `X`, `x`) in patterns on each beat

---

**Plan:**

- Add steady kick hits to provide low end â€” for example, hits on beats 1 and 3 or a simple driving 4-on-the-floor (kick on every quarter note).

- Optionally, add some tom hits on off beats or ghost notes.

- Keep existing cymbal and hi-hat pattern to retain texture.

I will add kick hits on beats 1 and 3 (positions 0 and 8).

No tom hits for simplicity, but could add if requested.
