The original groove already includes hi-hat (closed hits) and snare hits (on beats 2 and 4). The requested edit asks for both hi-hat and snare, which are present. However, the snare hits currently are only two plain hard hits; perhaps we can enhance the snare presence by adding some more nuanced hits (soft hits or additional ghost notes) to make the snare more prominent and interesting, while preserving the hi-hat pattern.

**Thought process:**

- Keep the main snare hits on 2 and 4 as hard hits 'O'.
- Add some soft snare ghost notes 'o' on off beats to add groove.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern as is.
- Leave the kick and other parts unchanged.
