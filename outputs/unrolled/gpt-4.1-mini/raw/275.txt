The original groove already has kick and ride cymbal (`R`) parts, plus snare but no hi-hat. The request says the groove should have not only ride but also kick â€” the kick is already included, so I will just keep it and maintain the ride pattern.

**Thought process:**  
- Keep the existing kick pattern as it is.  
- Keep snare and ride patterns as is.  
- No hi-hat was requested or present, so I will leave it empty.
