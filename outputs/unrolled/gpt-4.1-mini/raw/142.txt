The original groove only has soft/closed hi-hat and ride cymbal hits; no kick, snare, or toms.

---

**Request:** Groove should have tom and also hi-hat.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Hi-hat is already present, so keep it as is or enhance slightly.  
- Add tom hits to introduce tom presence without overpowering groove.  
- Keep the laid-back feel of the existing ride and hi-hat pattern.
