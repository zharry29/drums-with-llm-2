The original groove has soft kicks ('o'), some soft sidestick snare hits ('X' and 'X'), hi-hat closed soft hits ('x'), and ride cymbal soft and hard hits. The drum groove already contains snare sidesticks but no actual snare drum hits ('O' or 'o'). The request is to have not only hi-hat but also snare.

**Thought process:**  
- Add some real snare drum hits, likely hard hits ('O') on typical backbeats (beats 2 and 4).  
- Keep the existing sidesticks as ghost/snare embellishments to preserve groove character.  
- Keep hi-hat (closed) pattern the same.  
- Keep kicks as is (soft kicks), to maintain the light groove feel.  
- Keep ride pattern as is.
