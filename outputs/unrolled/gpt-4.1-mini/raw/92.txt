The current groove has:  
- Kick drum with hits on offbeats and syncopated spots.  
- Snare with a single unconventional notation "S" (likely a typo; assuming no snare sound).  
- Hi-hat has a steady pattern of soft closed hits (`x`) on every other 16th note, giving a consistent ride-like pulse.  
- Toms have a single hard hit late in the 3rd bar.  
- Crash cymbals on every downbeat.  
- Ride cymbal silent.

---

**Request:** Groove should have **not only kick but also hi-hat**.

---

**Thought process:**  
- The groove already has hi-hats (`x`), so no major change is needed for hi-hat presence.  
- The snare line currently has an unusual "S" which doesn't match the notation described (no 'S' mentioned). Likely a typo, so I'll change it to dashes (no snares).  
- To further emphasize hi-hat, add open hi-hat (`o`) on the 4th 16th note (offbeat after beats 2 and 4), enriching the groove dynamically.  
- Keep the rest intact.
