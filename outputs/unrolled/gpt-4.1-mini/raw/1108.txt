The 'a' of the second beat corresponds to the 4th 16th note of beat 2. Counting from 0, the second beat starts at position 4, so positions within beat 2 are:  
- 4 = 1  
- 5 = e  
- 6 = &  
- 7 = a  

The 'a' is position 7.

The request says to add a cymbal hit on position 7 of beat 2.

Currently, the Crash cymbal (C) line is:  
`C: O---|O---|O---|O---`

Positions in the second beat: `O---` = hits only at position 0 of that beat, which is position 4 overall.

We need to add a cymbal hit at position 7 (the 4th 16th note in beat 2). Since 'O' means a hard hit and 'o' means a soft hit, and no articulation type was specified, I will use a hard hit 'O' to make it more distinct.

So the second beat cymbal string `O---` becomes `---O`.
