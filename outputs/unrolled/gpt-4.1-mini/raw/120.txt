The original groove does not contain any ride cymbal (`R:` line is empty) or crash cymbal (`C:` line is empty). It has kick, snare, and hi-hat only.

---

**Request:** The groove should have not only ride but also cymbal.

---

**Thought process:**

- Add ride cymbal hits to add that element.  
- Add crash cymbal hits for complementing the ride and fulfilling the “also cymbal” request.  
- Place crash cymbal on strong downbeats to keep clarity.  
- Place ride cymbal with a flowing pattern, for instance on off-beats or steady quarter notes.  
- Keep everything else unchanged.
