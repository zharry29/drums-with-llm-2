Let's analyze the groove:

- Kick drum hits on beats 1 ("O" at pos 1 and 4), beat 3 ("O" at pos 10), and occasional spaces.

- Snare has a mix of hard and soft hits on beats 2 and 3, with some syncopation.

- Hihat has a steady pattern of hard and soft closed hits on every off 16th note.

- No cymbals present.

---

**Request:** Add some snare to the groove.

---

**Thought process:**

- The snare line already has multiple hits, but the "o" soft hits can be filled in a bit to add more rhythmic movement.

- Add a couple more soft snares "o" on the very sparse off beats, for example:

  - Beat 1: position 3 (currently "-") → add "o"

  - Beat 4: position 14 (currently "-") → add "o"

Original snare:  
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o  
Positions:  
1-4|5-8|9-12|13-16  
- - - - | O o - o | - o - - | O - - o

Add "o" in position 3 and 14:

Updated snare:  
S: --o-|Oo-o|-o--|O-o-
