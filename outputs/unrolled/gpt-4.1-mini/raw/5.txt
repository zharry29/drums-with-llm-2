The original groove is quite sparse and subtle:  
- Kick drum with soft hits scattered on downbeats and the "and" of 2 and 4.  
- Snare plays sidestick hits (X) on some offbeats (e.g., upbeats of beats 2 and 3).  
- Hihat has soft closed hits (x) on the "and" of beats 2 and 4.  
- Ride cymbal plays a closed bow pattern with alternating hard/soft hits.  
- No toms currently.

Adding toms should complement the groove subtly, to maintain its laid-back feel.

I will add:  
- A soft tom hit (o) on the "a" of beat 2 (position 8), to fill the gap after the snare sidestick.  
- A hard tom hit (O) on the "e" of beat 3 (position 10), acting as a slight accent.  
- A soft tom hit (o) on the "e" of beat 4 (14), adding more subtle movement.

Positions map:  
- Beat 1: 1-4  
- Beat 2: 5-8  
- Beat 3: 9-12  
- Beat 4: 13-16
