The original groove already has crash cymbals on each downbeat (bars 1 to 4) and snare hits are present on beats 2 and 4 (soft snare hits 'O'). The request is to have groove with not only cymbal but also snare, so snare is there but sparse.

**Thought process:**  
- Make the snare more prominent by adding hard snare hits ('O') on beats 2 and 4 throughout the groove.  
- Keep the powerful kick pattern and crash cymbals as is.  
- Leave hi-hat and toms silent per original.

The original already satisfied the request of cymbal and snare directly without changes needed beyond emphasizing snare, but since the snare is already there on beats 2 and 4, the groove is good as-is.
