The original groove features only a sparse hi-hat (soft closed hits on the 2nd beat's first 16th note and 4th beat's first 16th note) and a consistent ride cymbal pattern on the bell with both hard and soft closed hits. The kick drum is currently silent.

---

**Request:** Add kick drum hits so the groove has not only hi-hat but also kick.

---

**Thought process:**  
- Add kick hits to establish a basic pulse, e.g., on beats 1 and 3 (positions 1 and 9) to provide a solid foundation.  
- Keep the existing hi-hat and ride cymbal pattern unchanged.  
- No other instruments added.
