The original snare line is:

```
S: ----|----|S---|----
```

Here, `S` is not defined in the original key â€” only `O`, `o`, `X`, and `x` are used for snare hits (`O` hard hit, `o` soft open hit, `X` hard sidestick, `x` soft sidestick). Since `S` is not a valid articulation, I assume it's a typo or shorthand for a snare hit, most likely a hard hit (`O`).

The snare hit occurs on the first 16th note of the 3rd beat (beat 3, 1st 16th note).

To make it more dynamic:

- Introduce a mixture of articulation, such as a combination of hard and soft hits.  
- Add a ghost note (soft hit, `o`) before or after the main snare hit with correct timing.  
- Possibly play a sidestick hit before or after the main snare.

Keeping the snare hit on the same place (beat 3, 1st 16th), an example improvement can be:

- Add a ghost note `o` on the 4th 16th note of beat 2 (just before the snare hit).  
- Change the main snare hit to a hard hit `O`.  
- Possibly add a soft sidestick `x` on the 3rd 16th note of beat 3 for added dynamics.

Revised snare line:

```
S: ----|---o|O-x-|----
```

Explanation:

- Beat 2: 4th 16th note `o` soft open hit as ghost note.  
- Beat 3: 1st 16th note `O` hard hit (main snare), 3rd 16th note `x` soft sidestick hit.
