Let's analyze:

- The second beat is the 5th to 8th character in each line (after ignoring '|').
- The snare line currently has dashes "`----`" in second beat, but "S" at position 9 (which is first 16th of third beat).
- User wants snare on every 16th note in the second beat â†’ all four 16th notes positions 5,6,7,8 should have snare hits.

Since snare articulation is not specified for the requested notes, I'll use "O" (hard hits) for consistent impact.

Result:

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|OOOO|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
