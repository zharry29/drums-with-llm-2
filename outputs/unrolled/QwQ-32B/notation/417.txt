block. Let me parse each line:

K (Kick drum): ----|----|----|----
S (Snare drum): ----|----|----|----
H (Hihat): ----|x---|----|x---
T (Toms): ----|----|----|----
C (Crash cymbal): ----|----|----|----
R (Ride cymbal): x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The user's request is to remove any hihat or kick. So I need to set the K and H lines to all '-' characters. Let's check each line:

- **Kick (K):** It's already all '-', so no change needed here. But since the user mentioned removing kick, maybe double-check if there's any note. The original K line is all dashes, so it's okay.
  
- **Hihat (H):** The current H line has some 'x' and '-' characters. To remove hihat, all these should be replaced with '-'. The current H line is "----|x---|----|x---". Changing that to "----|----|----|----".

The other instruments (S, T, C, R) should stay as they are unless they're part of what's being removed. Since the request is only about hihat and kick, the rest remain. Let me verify each line:

- **Snare (S):** All '-' so no change.
- **Toms (T):** All '-', so no change.
- **Crash (C):** All '-', so no change.
- **Ride (R):** The ride has "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-". Since ride is not being removed, leave it as is.

Wait, the user said "I don't want any hihat or kick." So the only changes needed are to set K and H lines to all '-'.

Let me reconstruct the drum groove accordingly:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

I should make sure that in the H line, all the 'x's are replaced with '-'. The original H line had "----|x---|----|x---", so after removal, it's four beats of all '-'.

Yes, that looks correct. No other instruments are affected. The ride cymbal remains untouched. So the final edited groove should have K and H lines cleared, while the rest stay the same.
