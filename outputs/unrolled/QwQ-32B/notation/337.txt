is needed. Let me check the example responses. In previous cases, when removing instruments, even if they were already off, they kept them as dashes. So the correct output is as the user's input but ensuring H and T are clear. Since they are already clear, the answer is same as input except maybe aligning the lines properly. Wait, looking at the input:

The user's input has H and T as all dashes, so the edited version doesn't need changes. Therefore, the final answer is the same as the input, just presented again.
