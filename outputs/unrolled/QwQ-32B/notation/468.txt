Wait, let me make sure the beats are correctly divided by |. Each line should have four beats (four groups of four characters). Let me confirm the K line after replacement is four groups of four '-', which it is: ----|----|----|----

Same for S line. That should be correct. Alright, I think that's all. The user just wants snare and kick removed, so this should fulfill the request.
