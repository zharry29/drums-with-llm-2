block would be:

T: -O-o|-O-o|-O-o|-O-o

Let me check the length: each segment is four characters, four segments separated by |, so total 16 characters. Yes.

So the edited groove would have the T line as above. Let me confirm with the user's previous edits. In their first example, they added toms in a pattern with some variation, so this approach is consistent with adding a rhythmic tom part without overcomplicating.
