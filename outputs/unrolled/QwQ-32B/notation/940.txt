K: O---|----|O---|----
So breaking it down:
Beat 1: O---
Beat 2: ----
Beat 3: O---
Beat 4: ----

Wait, so actually, the kick is hitting on the first 16th note of beats 1 and 3. The fourth beat's kick is already silent (all dashes). But the user's request says "I don't want kick on beat 4 but everything else is fine." Hmm, maybe there was a mistake here?

Wait, let me confirm again. The original K line is O---|----|O---|----. So beat 4 is "----", meaning no kick there. The user might have thought there was a kick on beat 4, but in the given groove, it's already not present. So maybe the user's request is redundant here? But perhaps I should check if there's an error in the input.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the original K line. Let me check again. The user's input for the drum groove is:

K: O---|----|O---|----

Yes, so beat 4 is "----", so no kick. The user might have made a mistake, but I should proceed as per their instruction. Since they want to remove the kick on beat 4, but it's already removed, the edit would leave it as is. However, maybe there was a typo, and the original had a kick on beat 4. Let me check the user's input again carefully.

Wait, looking back, maybe I miscounted. Let me parse each part again. Each beat is four characters:

- First beat: O---
- Second: ----
- Third: O---
- Fourth: ----

So beat 4 is indeed silent for the kick. Therefore, the user's request is already fulfilled. But since they asked to remove it, perhaps the original had a kick there and there was a mistake in the provided example. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to remove any kick on beat 4 even if it's already not there. 

In that case, the edited version would be the same as the original. But to comply with the request, I'll present the same K line as before. Let me check the other instruments to ensure nothing else is changed. The user said "everything else is fine," so only the kick on beat 4 should be modified. Since it's already not there, the result remains the same.

Wait, but maybe the user's input had a different K line. Let me double-check the user's input again. The user provided:
