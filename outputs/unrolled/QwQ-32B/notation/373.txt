Yes, T and R lines are all dashes. So perhaps the user wants to ensure that even if there were any, they are removed. Since they are already gone, the edited version remains the same. But maybe the user expects an empty T and R regardless. 

Alternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The user's edit request is to remove any tom or ride. Since T and R are already empty, the answer would just be the same as the original, but with T and R lines cleared again. 

Alternatively, perhaps in the original input, there were some hits in T or R that I didn't see. Let me triple-check. The user's input shows T: all dashes, R: all dashes. So the answer would be the same as the original, but perhaps the user wants to make sure. 

Therefore, the edited groove should keep K, S, H as they are, and set T and R to all '-'.

So the final answer should be the same as the original, except ensuring T and R are dashes. Since they already are, the output is the same. But maybe the user expects that even if there were, so I'll proceed to present that.
