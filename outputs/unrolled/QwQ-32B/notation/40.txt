blocks include the | separators. The user's original R line was 16 chars (excluding |), so each line should have 16 characters (4 per beat, 4 beats). 

Wait, each line is structured as four beats, each beat four characters, so total 16 characters (excluding |). The | are separators. So the correct format is four segments of four characters each, separated by |. So the Ride line should be:

R: -oO-|-oO-|-oO-|-oO-

Yes, that's correct. Each segment is four characters. Let me double-check that. Each beat is four 16th notes, so four characters per beat, four beats, so 16 total characters. 

Therefore, the edited groove should look like this with the Ride added as above.
