Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the tom hit on beat 4, but everything else should stay the same. First, I need to look at the given drum notation to understand where the toms are played.

The original groove is:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

Looking at the T line (Toms), it's all dashes, meaning no tom hits. Wait a second, the user is asking to remove toms on beat 4, but there are no toms in the original. Maybe I misread. Let me check again.

The user's edit request says, "I don't want tom on beat 4 but everything else is fine." Since the T line has no hits, maybe there's a mistake? Perhaps the user intended another instrument, but since the instruction specifically mentions tom, I'll proceed under the assumption that maybe there was a typo, but since the T line is clear, perhaps they meant another part. Alternatively, maybe the user confused tom with another instrument. Alternatively, perhaps the original had a tom hit in beat 4 that I'm missing.

Wait, looking again at the original provided:

T: ----|----|----|----

So all four beats are dashes. There's no tom hit anywhere. Therefore, the user's request might be based on a different version, but according to the given data, there's nothing to remove. Since the user's instruction says "everything else is fine," I'll just confirm that the Toms line remains as is. So the edited version should be exactly the same as the original because there were no toms to remove. Therefore, the final answer would just replicate the original, but maybe I should check if there's a hidden tom hit in another line.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to the ride or crash? Let me check the other lines. The R (ride) line has X-x- on beat 2 and X-x- on beat 4. But the user mentioned tom. Since Toms are separate, and T line is clear, perhaps the user made a mistake, but I have to follow the instruction as given. Since there's no tom on beat 4, the edit doesn't change anything. Therefore, the edited groove remains the same as the original.
