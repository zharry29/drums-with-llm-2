Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any ride or tom parts from the given groove. Let me first look at the original groove provided.

Starting with each instrument line:

**Kick (K):** "O--O|----|--O-|----" – This has some kick hits, but since the user didn't mention removing kick, I'll leave this as is.

**Snare (S):** "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o" – Snare is present, but the request is about ride and toms, so keep snare.

**Hihat (H):** "X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-" – The user didn't mention hihat, but since the edit is about ride and toms, I'll check if hihat needs removal. Wait, the user said "no ride or tom," so hihat stays unless specified. Wait, the user's request is "I don't want any ride or tom." So hihat is separate. So leave hihat as is unless there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again: the user says "no ride or tom," so hihat is okay. So keep H.

**Toms (T):** "----|----|----|----" – Already empty, so no change needed here. Wait, the original T line is all dashes, so that's fine.

**Crash (C):** "----|----|----|----" – Also empty, so no issue.

**Ride (R):** "----|----|----|----" – Already empty. The user wants no ride, which is already satisfied.

Wait, but let me double-check the original drum groove provided:

Looking again at the user's input:

The given groove's R line is "----|----|----|----", so there's no ride in the original. The Toms (T) are also all dashes, so they're already not present. So the user's request might already be fulfilled. However, maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to another part? Let me check again. The user's edit request is "I don't want any ride or tom." In the given groove, both R and T lines are already empty. So the answer would just be the same as the original? That seems odd. Maybe there was a mistake in the input?

Wait, let me check the provided drum groove again carefully:

The user's input groove is:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, so the Toms and Ride are already not present. Therefore, applying the edit would mean keeping everything else as is. But the user might have intended that perhaps there was a typo, but according to the given data, the T and R lines are already empty. Therefore, the edited version remains the same except maybe ensuring that T and R are empty. Since they already are, the result is the same as input except maybe formatting, but the user's instruction is to remove them, so perhaps just confirming that those lines are all dashes.

Therefore, the final answer should keep K, S, H as they are, and T and R as empty.
