Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any cymbals and snare from the given groove. Let me first look at the original groove they provided.

Starting with each instrument line:

- **Kick (K):** "O---|O---|----|O---" – this is fine since they only want to remove snare and cymbals, so kick stays.
- **Snare (S):** "----|----|O---|----" – needs to be turned off. Replace all non '-' characters with '-'.
- **Hihat (H):** All dashes, so no change needed here.
- **Toms (T):** "O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-" – since toms aren't mentioned in the removal request, they stay.
- **Crash (C):** All dashes, so already okay.
- **Ride (R):** All dashes, so also okay.

Wait, the user said "no cymbal or snare". Cymbals include Crash (C) and Ride (R). But in the original, both C and R lines are already empty. So only the snare (S) needs to be cleared. Let me double-check the original:

Original S line: "----|----|O---|----" – the third beat has an O, which is a hard hit on the snare. So replacing that O with '-' will remove the snare. The rest of the lines (C and R) are already clear. So the edited version should have S as all dashes and keep K, T as they are, and leave H, C, R as they are. Let me confirm:

After editing:
- K remains: O---|O---|----|O---
- S becomes: ----|----|----|----
- H stays: ----|----|----|----
- T remains: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- C and R stay empty.

Yes, that should do it. I need to make sure no other cymbals are present, which they aren't here. So the final groove should look like that.
