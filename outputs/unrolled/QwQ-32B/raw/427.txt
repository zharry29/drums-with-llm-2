Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the tom and kick parts from the given groove. First, I need to look at each line of the drum notation provided.

Starting with the Kick (K line): "O---|O---|----|O---". Since they don't want any kick, I'll replace all the 'O's and 'o's with '-' to silence those hits. That line becomes all dashes.

Next, the Snare (S line): "----|----|O---|----". The user didn't mention snare, so I leave the snare hits as they are unless instructed otherwise. The edit request only targets tom and kick, so snare stays.

Hihat (H line) is all dashes, so no changes there.

Now the Toms (T line): "O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-". The user wants no toms, so replace all 'O' and 'o' with '-'.

Crash (C) and Ride (R) lines are already silent, so they stay as is.

Double-checking the edit request again to ensure I didn't miss anything. Yep, only tom and kick are to be removed. The final result should have K and T lines all dashes, keeping the rest intact.
