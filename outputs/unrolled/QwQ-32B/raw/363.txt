Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. Let me start by understanding the problem. The user provided a drum notation example and the current groove, and they want to remove any cymbals or ride parts. 

First, I should recall what each line represents. The lines are for Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R). The user mentioned not wanting cymbals or ride, so that includes Crash (C) and Ride (R). I need to set those lines to all '-'.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, actually in the provided groove, the C and R lines are already all '-' except maybe I need to check again. Wait, let me look again. The user's input shows:

In the given groove, under C and R, it's all dashes. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

The user's input shows:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, so both C and R are already empty. The user's request is to remove any cymbal or ride, but in this case, they are already not present. Hmm, maybe there was a mistake here. But perhaps in the original input, maybe there was some content in C or R that I need to clear?

Wait, looking back at the user's exact input for the drum groove:

R: ----|----|----|----

So both C and R lines are already all dashes. So the user's request might be redundant here, but maybe I should still proceed to ensure they are set to nothing. Since the user is asking to remove cymbals (crash) and ride, and those lines are already empty, then the edited version would be the same as the original. But perhaps there was a typo, and maybe the original had some notes in C or R that need removing.

Wait, let me double-check. The user might have provided a different groove. Wait, the user's exact input for the groove here shows C and R as empty. Maybe the user intended to have some cymbals but they were not present. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to ensure that even if there were, they are removed.

Alternatively, maybe in the original groove (the one before any edits), there were cymbals, but in the current version provided, they are already gone. Since the user is submitting this as a new request, perhaps the current groove already has C and R cleared, but the user is just being cautious. 

In any case, the correct approach is to set both C and R lines to all '-' characters. Since they are already all '-', the result would be the same. However, to comply strictly with the request, I'll present the groove with C and R lines as empty, even if they were already so. 

Therefore, the final edited groove would have K, S, H, T as before, and C and R all dashes. So the answer should be the same as the input provided by the user, but I need to confirm that. Wait, maybe I misread the user's input. Let me check again:

The user's given groove has C and R as:

C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So they are already empty. Therefore, applying the edit would leave them as they are. However, maybe the user intended that there were some cymbal/ride notes, but in this case, there aren't. So the edited version is the same as the original. 

Alternatively, perhaps there was an error in the user's input, but since I must work with what's given, I'll proceed to output the same groove with C and R lines cleared, which they already are. So the final answer remains the same as the input provided.
