Okay, so the user wants a hihat hit and a snare in the very beginning of the drum groove provided. Let me look at the original groove first.

The original is:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Hmm, the first beat of each line is all dashes except the hihat, which has nothing in the first beat. The snare is completely silent. The user wants both a hihat and a snare hit at the very start. 

First, the very beginning is the first 16th note of the first beat, which is the first character in each line. For the hihat (H line), currently it's "----" in the first beat. To add a hit there, I need to replace the first '-' with an articulation. Since the user didn't specify open or closed, but the existing hihat pattern uses 'x' (soft closed hit?), maybe I'll use 'x' again for consistency. So the first character of H's first beat becomes 'x', making it "x---".

Next, the snare (S line) needs a hit in the first 16th note. The user didn't specify hard or soft, but since it's the beginning, maybe a hard hit (O) is better for impact. So change the first '-' in S's first beat to 'O', making it "O---".

Wait, but I should check if there's any existing pattern. The original S line is all dashes except maybe other parts. Since the user just wants the very beginning, only the first note of the first beat needs the snare. The rest can stay as they are. 

Let me confirm the notation rules again. For S (snare), O is hard, o is soft open, X and x are sidestick. Since the user didn't mention sidestick, using O for a standard hard hit makes sense here.

So applying these changes:

H line first beat becomes "x---" instead of "----".

S line first beat becomes "O---".

Other lines remain the same. Let me check if that's all. The rest of the groove should stay as per original except the first hit on both H and S. 

Wait, the user's original H line has "----" in the first beat, so adding the 'x' there. The R (ride) and others are okay. 

So the edited groove would be:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: O---|----|----|----
H: x---|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Wait, but in the original H line, the second beat is "|x---", so the first beat was "----", so changing first to "x---" and keeping the rest. Yes.

That should do it. The first hit has a snare (O) and hihat (x), fulfilling the request.
