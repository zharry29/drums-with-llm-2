Okay, I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. Let's start by understanding what they want. The user said, "I don't want any hihat or snare." 

First, I'll look at the given drum groove to see which lines correspond to hihat (H) and snare (S). 

Looking at the provided drum notation:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

Wait, actually in the given groove, the Hihat line (H) is already all dashes, so there's no hihat playing. But the user still mentioned removing hihat, maybe just to be thorough. The snare (S) line has some hits. So the main task is to remove the snare by setting all its characters to '-' and ensure hihat remains empty. Also, check if there are any other elements they might want removed, but according to the request, only hihat and snare.

So, modifying the S line to all dashes and keeping H as it is. The rest like Kick (K), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R) can stay unless specified. The user didn't mention those, so leave them. Let me double-check the original edit request again to confirm: "I don't want any hihat or snare." 

Yes, so the edited version should have S and H lines all dashes. The existing H line is already clear, so just set S to all dashes. The other lines remain as in the original groove except S. 

Let me reconstruct the final version:

K remains: O--O|----|--O-|----
S becomes: ----|----|----|----
H stays: ----|----|----|----
T, C, R stay the same as original. Wait, in the original provided groove, T, C are empty, and R has some hits. Since the user didn't mention Ride or Toms, those stay. 

Wait, looking at the user's input again, in their provided groove:

Original groove's lines:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

So the user wants S and H removed. Since H is already all dashes, only S needs to be set to dashes. Therefore the final should have S as all dashes. 

So the edited drum groove should look like:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

That's it. I need to present this between the @@@ as per instructions.
