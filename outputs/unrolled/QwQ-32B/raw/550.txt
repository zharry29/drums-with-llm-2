Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any tom or snare parts from the given groove. First, I'll look at the original drum notation provided.

Starting with the Kick (K) line: "O---|----|O---|----". That's just the kick drum hits, which are allowed since the request is to remove toms and snares. So I'll leave that as is.

Next, the Snare (S) line has "----|O---|----|O---". Since the user doesn't want any snare, I need to replace all the O's in the snare line with '-' to mute them. So the S line becomes "----|----|----|----".

Then the Hihat (H) is "X---|X---|X---|X---". The user didn't mention removing hihats, so this stays the same. 

Toms (T) are already all dashes, so no change there. 

Crash (C) and Ride (R) are also empty, so they remain unchanged. 

Wait, let me double-check. The user said "no tom or snare". Toms are already off, so just the snare needs to be turned off. So the final lines should have K as original, S all dashes, H as before, and T, C, R as they are. 

Putting it all together, the edited groove should look like this with the snare line cleared out.
