Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the snare from beat 4 while keeping everything else the same. 

First, I'll look at the original groove provided. The snare line (S) is:

S: ----|O---|----|O---

Breaking it down by beats:
- Beat 1: ---- (no snare)
- Beat 2: O--- (hard hit on the first 16th note)
- Beat 3: ---- (no snare)
- Beat 4: O--- (hard hit on the first 16th note)

The request is to remove the snare from beat 4. So, I need to change the fourth beat's "O---" to "----".

Let me double-check other instruments to ensure nothing else is affected. The kick (K), hihat (H), toms (T), crash (C), and ride (R) all stay the same. The only change is on the snare's fourth beat.

So, modifying the S line to:

S: ----|O---|----|----

Putting it all together, the edited groove should look like this with only the snare's fourth beat altered.
