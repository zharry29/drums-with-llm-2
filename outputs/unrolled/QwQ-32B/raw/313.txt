Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove to include both snare and cymbal. Let me look at the given groove first.

The original groove has Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), and Crash (C) but no Ride (R). The user wants not just snare but also cymbal, which probably means adding Ride since Crash is already there but maybe not used throughout. Let me check the existing instruments:

- K: Some kick hits.
- S: Snare on the 2nd and 4th beats.
- H: Hihat with some open and closed hits.
- C: Crash on the first beat of each bar.
- R: Nothing, all dashes.

The edit request says "not only snare but also cymbal". Since Crash is already a cymbal, maybe they want another cymbal like Ride to add more texture. Alternatively, maybe they want the existing cymbal (Crash) to be more prominent or combined with Ride. But the original has Crash only on the first 16th note of each bar. To add another cymbal, Ride would be a good choice to provide a continuous rhythm.

Looking at the Ride line (R), it's all dashes. To add Ride, I can create a pattern that complements the existing Snare and Hihat. The Hihat is doing closed and open hits, so maybe the Ride can add a steady closed hit on the bow (using X or x). Since the Snare is on beats 2 and 4, the Ride could have a steady 8th or 16th note pattern. Let me see the Hihat's pattern:

H: --o- | O-o- | O-o- | O-o-
This seems like on the first beat, there's a soft open hit on the third 16th note, then open and closed hits. Maybe the Ride can have a consistent pattern, like every quarter note or eighth note.

The user's previous examples often used -X-X or similar for Ride, so maybe a steady quarter notes with closed hits. Let me try adding Ride hits on every quarter note as X (hard closed hits). Since each beat is four 16th notes, a quarter note would be every four notes. So for four beats, it would be every four characters. Let's see:

Original bars divided into four beats (each beat is four 16ths):

First bar (K: O--- | ---o | O-O- | ----):
R needs to have something. Let's try -X-X for each beat. So four beats would be -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X. That would give a steady eighth note pattern (every two 16ths), but maybe that's too busy. Alternatively, every beat (quarter note) would be X--- repeated. Hmm, but the user's previous edits often used -X-X, so maybe that's the standard.

Alternatively, since the Snare is on the 2nd and 4th beats, Ride could syncopate with that. Let me check the Snare line:

S: ---- | O--- | ---- | O---
So snare on the second beat (O---) and fourth (O---). So maybe the Ride can have hits on the offbeats. But to follow previous patterns, perhaps just adding a steady ride pattern.

Also, the Crash is only on the first 16th of each bar. Maybe keeping that and adding Ride throughout would fulfill the cymbal requirement. So replacing the R line with a consistent pattern. Let me try:

R: -X-X | -X-X | -X-X | -X-X

This would give a steady eighth note closed ride hits. That should add the needed cymbal layer. Let me check if that's acceptable. The user's previous edits when adding Ride used similar patterns, so this should be okay.

Now, the Snare is already present, so the main change is adding Ride. The Crash is already there but only once per bar, so maybe the user wants more cymbal presence, so Ride is the way to go. The final groove would have S and R (both cymbals?), but actually S is snare, R is ride. Since the request is to have not only snare but also cymbal (so adding another cymbal besides Crash?), so Ride is appropriate.

So the edited groove would keep the original parts and add the Ride as described.
