Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a drum groove and wants me to edit it by removing any kick or ride elements. 

First, I need to recall the structure of the drum notation. Each line represents an instrument: K for kick, S for snare, H for hihat, T for toms, C for crash cymbal, and R for ride. The user's request is to eliminate both kick (K) and ride (R), so those lines should be cleared out.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The K line has some hits (like O and o), and the R line is already empty. Since the user doesn't want kick, I'll replace all characters in the K line with '-' to indicate no hits. The R line is already clear, so no changes there. 

Next, I should check other instruments to ensure they're not affected. The snare (S), hihat (H), toms (T), and crash (C) lines are okay as they don't involve kick or ride. The crash has some hits (O--- in the first beat), but since the user didn't mention removing crashes, those stay.

Wait, let me double-check the user's request: "I don't want any kick or ride." So only K and R should be removed. The crash (C) is a separate cymbal and isn't mentioned, so it remains. 

So the edited version should have K and R lines all dashes. Let me reconstruct that:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: remains as is: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ---- (no changes)
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I should verify that I didn't miss any characters. Each line has 16 characters (4 beats of 4 notes each). Let's count for K line: each beat is 4 '-', so 4 beats make 16. Yes. The S line's original first beat is "----", second "|O---", third "|----", fourth "|O---". Wait, but the user's input shows S as "----|O---|----|O---", which is correct. So keeping that.

Crash line has "O---" in the first beat and the rest dashes, which is fine. 

No typos noticed. Looks good. Let me present this in the required format.
