Okay, I need to edit the given drum groove so that it includes toms in addition to the hihat. Let me start by looking at the original groove provided.

The original drum notation is:

@@@
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

First, I'll note which instruments are already present. The Kick (K) has hits, the Snare (S) has a hit in the third beat, the Hihat (H) is active throughout with x's, Toms (T) only have a single O on the third beat's fourth 16th note, Crashes (C) are持续 throughout, and Ride (R) is silent.

The user's request is to have not only hihat but also tom. Wait, actually, the request says "not only hihat but also tom". Wait, but in the original, the toms are already present, albeit minimally. Wait, let me check again. The T line has "----|----|---O|----", so there's only one tom hit in the third beat. Maybe the user wants more tom involvement beyond just that single hit?

Alternatively, perhaps the user meant that the groove should include both hihat and tom, but in the original, maybe the toms were not present? Wait, no, they are present but just a single hit. The user might want more tom parts. The original edit requests I've seen before were similar where the user wanted an instrument added that was previously not present, but here the tom is already there, so maybe the request is to have more tom hits.

Alternatively, maybe the user's request is phrased as "not only X but also Y", meaning that besides X (hihat), there should also be Y (tom). Since the hihat is already there, but the tom's presence is minimal, so perhaps the user wants to enhance the tom part to be more prominent.

So the task is to add more tom hits to make the groove have a stronger tom presence alongside the existing hihat. Let's see how to approach this.

Looking at the existing tom line: T: ----|----|---O|----

So currently, the toms only hit on the 12th 16th note of the third beat (third beat's last 16th note). To add more tom hits, I need to place O or o characters in other positions. Since the user didn't specify where, I should distribute them in a way that complements the existing kick and snare.

The kick has hits on:

- First beat: 1st and 4th 16ths? Wait the first beat is "-O--", so the second 16th note (position 2) is a hard kick hit O.

Second beat: "OO--", so first and second 16ths are O's.

Third beat: "---O", so the fourth 16th is O.

Fourth beat: "-OO-", so positions 2 and 3 are O's.

Snare is only on the third beat's third 16th note (S--- means the third position is S).

Hihat is x every other 16th note, creating a steady eighth note pattern (since x-x- is every two 16ths, so every eighth note).

Crash is hitting every beat's first 16th note (O--- repeated four times).

So the structure is a 4/4 bar with 16th notes. Let me think about where to place tom hits. Since the user wants more tom, perhaps adding hits on offbeats or syncopated rhythms.

Let me consider the third beat where the tom already has a hit. Maybe adding a tom hit on the first 16th of the third beat to pair with the crash, and another in the second beat?

Alternatively, to create a tom pattern that works with the kick. For example, in the first beat, maybe a tom on the first 16th to contrast with the kick's second 16th. But need to check for conflicts.

Alternatively, adding tom hits on the "and" of beats where there's space. Let me try to come up with a pattern that doesn't clash with the kick and snare.

Let's look at each beat:

First beat (positions 1-4):

K: -O--

So kick hits on 2nd 16th (position 2). The tom could hit on position 1 or 3 or 4. Maybe position 1 for a lead-in, or 3 or 4.

Second beat (positions 5-8):

K: OO--

Kick hits on 5 and 6 (first and second 16ths of the second beat). So positions 5 and 6. Tom could hit on 7 or 8, or maybe 4 (end of first beat's last 16th? Wait no, second beat is 5-8).

Third beat (positions 9-12):

K: ---O (hit on 12th 16th). The snare is on position 11 (third 16th of third beat). So tom already has a hit on 12. Maybe add another hit on 9 or 10.

Fourth beat (positions 13-16):

K: -OO- (hits on 14 and 15). So positions 14 and 15. Tom could hit on 13 or 16.

Also, the crash is on every first 16th of each beat (positions 1,5,9,13). Maybe align some tom hits with crashes for emphasis.

Let me try to distribute tom hits across all four beats. Since the original has a tom on the third beat's fourth 16th (position 12), perhaps adding one on each beat.

For example:

First beat: maybe a tom on the first 16th (position 1) to match the crash, so T's first character is O.

Second beat: maybe on the fourth 16th (position 8), so the second beat's fourth character is O.

Third beat already has one, maybe add another on the first 16th (position 9, which is the start of the third beat and crash), so T's third beat starts with O.

Fourth beat: maybe on the fourth 16th (position 16), so fourth beat's fourth character is O.

So T would be: O---|----|O---|---- but wait, but in the third beat's T line, it was ---O originally. So combining:

First beat: O--- (tom on 1)

Second beat: ---- (no tom, maybe on 8th 16th? So second beat's fourth character would be O, making it ---O)

Third beat: O--- (so first 16th, but original had ---O on third beat, so combining would be O--- for third beat?

Wait, the third beat's original T was ---O. If I want to add an O on the first 16th, it would be O---, but that would replace the original's ---O. Hmm, maybe better to keep the original's O at 12 and add another in the third beat.

Alternatively, in third beat, have O on 9 and 12: O---|O--- for the third beat? Wait the third beat's T was originally ---O, so to add another, maybe O-O- (positions 9,11?), but need to fit.

Alternatively, let's try to make the tom play on the first 16th of each beat (positions 1,5,9,13) to align with crashes. That would give T: O--- repeated four times. But check if that conflicts with kick:

First beat's tom O at position 1, kick at 2. That's okay.

Second beat's tom O at 5, kick at 5 and 6. So the tom and kick both hit at position 5. That could be okay, but maybe a clash. Alternatively, maybe offset.

Alternatively, have tom on the "and" of the beat, like the third 16th (position 3 of each beat). For example:

First beat: --O- (tom on position 3)

Second beat: --O- (position 7)

Third beat: --O- (position 11) but snare is also on 11. Hmm, maybe that's too much.

Alternatively, maybe alternate between beats. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, since the kick is active in certain places, the tom can fill in the gaps. For instance, in the first beat, between the kick at position 2, maybe a tom on 3 or 4.

First beat: positions 1: -, 2: O (kick), so tom on 3 or 4. Let's say 3: O. So first beat's T: -O--

Second beat: kick hits 5 and 6, so maybe tom on 7 or 8. Let's pick 8: so second beat's T: ---O

Third beat: already has a tom on 12, maybe add on 9 (start of beat, with crash) so O--- for third beat's T, making it O---|O---| but original third beat had ---O. So combining would be O-O- ?

Wait, third beat's T was originally ---O. So combining, maybe O--- (positions 9-12: O, -, -, O). That adds a tom hit on 9 and keeps the original on 12.

Fourth beat: kick on 14 and 15, so tom could be on 13 (crash) or 16. Let's do 13: O--- for fourth beat's T? But fourth beat's T was originally ----, so fourth beat's T: O--- would be O on 13, but crash is also there. That's okay.

Putting this all together:

T line would be:

First beat: -O-- (tom on 3)

Second beat: ---O (tom on 8)

Third beat: O-O- (tom on 9 and 12)

Fourth beat: O--- (tom on 13)

Wait, but each beat is four characters. Let me structure it properly:

First beat (positions 1-4): T's first four characters: -O-- (tom on 3)

Second beat (5-8): ---O (tom on 8)

Third beat (9-12): O-O- (tom on 9 and 12)

Fourth beat (13-16): O--- (tom on 13)

So the T line would be:

T: -O--|---O|O-O-|O---

But let's check if that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe make it more consistent. Maybe on every other beat's first 16th, but adjust as needed.

Alternatively, another approach: since the original tom only had one hit, I can add more hits in places where there's no kick or snare. For example:

First beat: positions 1-4. Kick at 2. Tom could hit 1 or 3 or 4.

Let's put tom on 1 (with crash) and 4 (after kick).

So first beat: O--O

Second beat: kick hits 5 and 6. Tom could hit 7 or 8. Let's do 7 and 8? But that's two hits. Maybe just 8.

Second beat: ---O

Third beat: already has tom at 12. Maybe add on 9 (crash) and 10 or 11 (but snare is at 11). So 9 and 12.

Third beat: O--- (tom at 9 and original at 12? Wait O--- would be tom on 9, then ---O would be on 12. So combining, it's O---|---O becomes O-O-.

Fourth beat: kick at 14 and 15. Tom could hit 13 (crash) and 16.

Fourth beat: O--- (tom at 13) and ---O (tom at 16). So O-O-?

Wait, fourth beat's T would be O--- (positions 13-16: O, -, -, -). To also hit 16, it would be O--- with the fourth character as O: O--O.

Putting it all together:

T: O--O|---O|O-O-|O--O

But need to check for note counts. Each beat is four characters. Let's structure each beat:

First beat: O--O

Second beat: ---O

Third beat: O-O- (O at 9, space, O at 12)

Fourth beat: O--O (O at 13, then three hyphens? Wait fourth beat's T would be O--O.

So the T line would be:

T: O--O|---O|O-O-|O--O

But let's see if that works. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user just wants to add more tom hits beyond the existing one. Let me try a simpler approach where I add a tom hit on each beat, perhaps on the downbeat (aligned with crash) and the original hit.

So each beat's first 16th (positions 1,5,9,13) has a tom, plus the original third beat's 12th.

Thus:

First beat: O--- (tom on 1)

Second beat: O--- (tom on 5)

Third beat: O--- (tom on 9) plus original's ---O (tom on 12). So combined O---|---O → O-O- ?

Wait, third beat's T line would be O--- (positions 9-12: O at 9, then --- but original had ---O. So combining, it would be O--- with the fourth character as O → O--O.

Fourth beat: O--- (tom on 13).

So T line would be:

O---|O---|O--O|O---

Wait but that would be four beats:

Beat1: O--- (positions 1-4)

Beat2: O--- (5-8)

Beat3: O--O (9-12)

Beat4: O--- (13-16)

But the original third beat's T had ---O (position 12). So this would add an extra tom on position 9 and keep the 12.

Alternatively, maybe that's okay. Let's see:

T: O---|O---|O--O|O---

This way, each beat has a tom on the downbeat (aligned with crash) and the third beat also has one on the fourth 16th. That might work.

Alternatively, to make it more consistent, have tom on every beat's first and third 16th or something. Let's see.

Alternatively, I can look at previous examples the user provided. In earlier interactions, when the user asked to add tom, the assistant often added a tom on every beat's third or fourth 16th, creating a pattern like --O- repeated. For instance, in a previous example, T was set to --O-|--O-|--O-|--O- for four beats. That might be a safe pattern.

Looking back at one of the previous answers, for example, when the user had a similar request, the assistant added T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O- or similar. So maybe following that pattern.

In the current case, the original T line was ----|----|---O|----. To add more tom hits, perhaps placing a tom hit on the third 16th of each beat (position 3,7,11,15). Let's see:

First beat's third 16th: position 3 → --O-

Second beat's third 16th: position 7 → --O- (so beat2 would be ---O? No, third 16th of beat2 is position7, so the second beat's third character is O. So second beat's T would be --O- ?

Wait each beat is four characters. So for beat1: positions1-4. The third 16th is position3 → so T: --O- for beat1.

Similarly for beat2 (positions5-8): third 16th is position7 → beat2's third character: --O-

Third beat (positions9-12): third is 11 → third beat's third character: O → so beat3's T: --O- but original had a tom at 12 (position12 is fourth character of third beat). So combining, beat3's T would be --O- but with an additional O at position12? That would be --OO?

But that's two hits in the same beat. Alternatively, maybe just use the pattern and overwrite the existing.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's previous examples just added a tom on every third 16th, so let's try that.

So T line would be:

--O-|--O-|--O-|--O-

But check if that's acceptable. However, the original had a tom on the fourth 16th of third beat. If we follow this pattern, third beat's T would be --O- (O at position11), but original had O at 12. The user might not mind replacing it, as the request is to have tom in addition to hihat, so adding more is fine.

Alternatively, maybe combine both: in third beat, have both the existing O and the new O. So third beat's T would be --OO?

But that's two hits in the third beat's fourth character? Let me see:

Original third beat's T: ---O (positions9-12: -, -, -, O)

New pattern third beat's T: --O- (O at position11). So combining, it would be --O- with an extra O at 12 → --OO.

But that might be okay. So the T line would be:

--O-|--O-|--OO|--O-

But need to ensure each beat is four characters.

Alternatively, to keep it simple and follow previous patterns, maybe just add tom hits on every third 16th, even if it replaces the existing one. The user's main point is to have tom present more.

So final T line:

--O-|--O-|--O-|--O-

But let me check with the original's third beat's tom hit. The user might prefer to retain that, so maybe adjust.

Alternatively, place a tom hit on every fourth 16th of each beat (positions4,8,12,16). That would align with the end of each beat.

So T: ---O|---O|---O|---O

This way, each beat's last 16th has a tom. The original third beat had a tom on 12, so this preserves that and adds to others. That might be a good approach.

So T line would be:

---O|---O|---O|---O

But check for conflicts:

First beat's fourth 16th (position4): kick is at position2, so tom at 4 is okay.

Second beat's fourth 16th (position8): kick hits at 5 and6, so tom at8 is fine.

Third beat's fourth (position12): already had it.

Fourth beat's fourth (position16): okay.

This way, tom hits every beat's last 16th, complementing the kick and snare. That could work well.

Alternatively, combining both approaches: hits on the third and fourth 16ths? Not sure.

Alternatively, let's go with the fourth 16th approach as it's clean and follows a pattern.

So the edited T line would be:

T: ---O|---O|---O|---O

This adds tom hits on every beat's fourth 16th, which were previously only on the third beat. The user's request was to have not only hihat but also tom, so this ensures tom is present in every beat, fulfilling the request.

Let me verify the original T line was ----|----|---O|----. So changing it to ---O on all beats adds three more tom hits (first, second, fourth beats), which meets the requirement.

Therefore, the final edited groove would have T as ---O repeated for each beat.
