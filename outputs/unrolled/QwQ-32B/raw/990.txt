Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the whole bar filled with double kick. The original groove has some kick hits and other elements. First, I need to understand what "double kick" means here. Probably, it means playing the kick drum on every 16th note, maybe alternating between hard (O) and soft (o) hits to create a double stroke effect.

Looking at the given groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----  

The kick line has varying patterns. To "fill up the whole bar with double kick," I should replace all the existing kick hits with a continuous double stroke pattern. The standard double kick pattern is usually alternating O and o on each 16th note, like OoOo for each beat. Since a bar has 16 notes (4 beats of 4 notes each), each beat would be OoOo. 

So, replacing the K line with OoOo repeated four times: OoOo|OoOo|OoOo|OoOo. That fills every 16th note with double strokes. 

Now, check other instruments. The user might want to keep everything else as is unless conflicting. The snare (S) has hits on the second and fourth beats. The crash (C) has hits on every beat. Since the edit is only about the kick, I leave S and C as they are. Hihat (H), Toms (T), and Ride (R) are silent except crashes, so they stay the same.

Wait, the original K line has some Os and - (rests). Replacing all with OoOo would remove those, but the user wants the whole bar filled. So yes, that's correct. The final K line should be all double strokes. The other instruments remain unchanged unless they interfere, but the edit request doesn't mention them. 

Double-check the notation: each beat is four characters. OoOo for each beat. That's 16 notes total. Perfect. So the edited groove should have the kick filled with double strokes, others as original except where they might clash, but the user didn't mention that. So proceed with that.
