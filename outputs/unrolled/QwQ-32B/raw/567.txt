Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any kick (K) and snare (S) parts. Let me start by looking at the original groove provided.

First, I'll check each line:

- **K line**: "o---|--o-|o---|--o-". Since the user doesn't want any kick, I need to replace all the 'o's and '-' with '-' to silence the kick. So this line becomes all dashes: "----|----|----|----".

- **S line**: "----|X---|--X-|----". The snare has some X and x hits. Removing snare means replacing all those with '-', so this line also becomes "----|----|----|----".

- **H line**: "----|x---|----|x---". The hihat is okay since the user only wants to remove kick and snare. The x's here are closed hits, which are allowed. So leave this as is unless there's another instruction, but the request doesn't mention hihat, so keep it.

- **T line**: All dashes, so no change needed.

- **C and R lines**: Also all dashes, so no changes there either.

Wait, but the user said "no kick or snare," so I just need to ensure K and S lines are cleared. Let me double-check each part:

Original K line: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
After removal: all dashes.

Original S line: has X and x in some beats. Setting to all dashes.

H line remains with x's. The user didn't mention hihat or ride, so those stay. The R line here is "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-", but wait, in the original provided groove, the R line was "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-". Wait, looking back at the user's input:

Wait, the user provided:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Ah, so the Ride (R) has some hits. The user didn't mention ride, so unless they specified to remove ride, it stays. The edit request was only about kick and snare.

Therefore, the edited version should have K and S lines as all dashes, others remain as is except any mention of ride? Wait, user said "no kick or snare", so ride is okay. So the final should be:

K: all dashes,

S: all dashes,

H remains,

T remains,

C and R as original (since C and R weren't mentioned to remove).

Wait, but in the R line, the user's original R line is "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-", which are closed hits on the ride bow. Since the user didn't ask to remove ride, those stay.

So putting it all together:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Wait, but in the original, the H line is "----|x---|----|x---", so that's okay.

Yes, that should be the result.
