Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to edit a drum groove by removing any parts involving toms (T) or cymbals (C and R). Let me first understand the given groove and then apply the changes.

Looking at the provided drum notation:

**Original Groove:**
```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

The user's request is to remove all tom (T) and cymbal (C, R) parts. Let's go through each line:

1. **Kick (K):** This line is fine as it's only kick, no toms or cymbals.
2. **Snare (S):** The snare has some X and x hits. Since X and x here are sidestick hits on the snare, they’re allowed. So no changes needed here.
3. **Hihat (H):** The hihat has x and possibly closed hits (since H uses x for closed). The user didn't mention removing hihat, so leave this as is.
4. **Toms (T):** Already all dashes, so nothing to remove here.
5. **Crash (C):** All dashes, so no issue.
6. **Ride (R):** This has x and X-x patterns. Since ride is a cymbal, we need to clear this line entirely.

Wait, but the user said "no tom or cymbal". Toms are already clear. The cymbals here are Crash (C) and Ride (R). Both C and R lines need to be set to all dashes. Let me check again:

- **C line:** Already all dashes, so no change.
- **R line:** Has x and X hits, so needs to be replaced with all '-'.

Also, the Hihat is allowed since it's not a cymbal? Wait, the instruments listed are K, S, H, T, C, R. Hihat (H) is separate and isn't a cymbal? Wait the description says H is hihat, which is a closed hi-hat or open. The cymbals are Crash (C) and Ride (R). So the user wants to remove T, C, R. So Hihat is okay to stay.

Therefore, the only line needing change is the Ride (R), which should be all dashes. The Tom line is already clear. Let me verify:

Original R line: `x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-` → change to `----|----|----|----`

So the edited groove would be:

K remains the same.

S remains the same.

H remains the same.

T stays as all dashes.

C stays as all dashes.

R becomes all dashes.

Putting it all together:

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

I should double-check if there's any other cymbal or tom hits. The T line is clear. The R line is now all dashes. The C line was already clear. So this should meet the user's request.
