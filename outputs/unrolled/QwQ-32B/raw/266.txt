Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a drum notation example and a specific groove that needs editing. The edit request says the groove should have not only cymbal but also hihat. Wait, but looking at the given groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Hmm, the H line (Hihat) already has X-x- patterns in each beat. So the hihat is already present. But the user wants "not only cymbal but also hihat". Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check again.

The original groove has Hihat active (H line has X and x), but the cymbals (C and R lines) are all dashes. The user's request might be to add cymbals (either crash or ride) in addition to the existing hihat. Because right now, there are no cymbals (C and R are empty). The request says "not only cymbal but also hihat" but since hihat is already there, maybe the user meant they want both cymbals and hihat, implying that currently only hihat is present and cymbals are missing. So the edit should add cymbals (either crash or ride) to the groove.

So the task is to add either crash (C) or ride (R) to the groove while keeping the existing hihat. Let's see. The user's previous examples often added ride in a steady pattern, like X-X- or similar. Let's go with ride cymbal (R) since it's common to have ride with hihat. Let's make the ride play on every 16th note, maybe alternating X and x for a steady closed hit. 

Looking at the original H line: X-x-|X-x- etc. Maybe syncopate the ride with that. Alternatively, a common pattern is quarter notes on the ride. Let's try adding R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X to give a steady quarter note pattern on the ride. Alternatively, maybe eighth notes. Let's check the kick and snare to see the rhythm.

The kick is O--O|----|--O-|---- which is a 16th note hit on the first and third 16th of the first beat, then nothing, then a 16th on the third of the third beat, etc. The snare has some syncopation. To complement, maybe a steady ride pattern. Let's go with R: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X- but adjusted per bar. Alternatively, every beat. Let's try R: X---|X---|X---|X--- (quarter notes) but using X for closed hits. Alternatively, eighth notes. Let me think. Since the Hihat is already doing X-x- which is 1/16 notes, maybe the ride can do every beat's first 16th. Or maybe a syncopated pattern. Alternatively, to make it simple, add R: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X- so every 8th note. Let's see:

So the edited groove would have R line filled with X-X- etc., keeping H as is. That way, it adds the ride cymbal in addition to the existing hihat. The user's previous edits often used X-X- patterns for ride when adding it. So I'll proceed with that.
