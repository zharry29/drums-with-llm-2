Okay, let's see. The user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing any tom and ride parts. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided.

Looking at the given drum notation:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

First, I need to identify which lines correspond to the instruments they want removed. The user mentioned "no tom or ride". 

- Toms are labeled as T. Here, T has "----|----|---O|----". So there's a tom hit in the third beat (---O). I need to remove that, replacing it with all '-'.
- Ride cymbal is labeled R. In this case, R is all dashes already, so no change there. But just to be thorough, maybe check if there's any accidental notation. Looks like R is clean.

Additionally, check for any other instruments. The user didn't mention snare or crash, so leave S and C as is unless there's a mistake. 

Wait, the user said "no tom or ride", so confirm that T and R are the only ones to be cleared. The crash (C) is still present with O--- in all beats. Since the user didn't mention removing crashes, those stay.

So the steps are:

1. Set all T line characters to '-'.
2. Ensure R is already clear, which it is.
3. Leave K, S, H, and C untouched unless there's an error.

Let me reconstruct each line:

Kick (K) remains the same: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
Snare (S) stays: ----|----|S---|----
Hihat (H) is unchanged: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
Toms (T) becomes: ----|----|----|----
Crash (C) stays: O---|O---|O---|O---
Ride (R) is already empty: ----|----|----|----

Double-check that T's third beat's O is removed. Yes, replacing ---O with ----. 

Everything else looks good. No other instruments to adjust. This should meet the user's request.
