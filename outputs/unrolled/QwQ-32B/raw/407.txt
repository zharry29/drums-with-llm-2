Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any hihat or cymbal parts. First, I need to look at the given drum notation and identify which lines correspond to hihat (H) and cymbals (C and R for crash and ride). 

Looking at the provided groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So, the H line has hihat hits, and the C line has crash cymbal hits. The R line is empty here, but since the user mentioned "no cymbal," I should also ensure that R is cleared just in case.

The edit request is straightforward: set all characters in H, C, and R lines to '-' (no hit). Let me go through each line:

- **Kick (K):** Remains the same since it's allowed.
- **Snare (S):** Also stays as it's not being removed.
- **Hihat (H):** All entries become '-'.
- **Toms (T):** Already empty, so no change.
- **Crash (C):** All entries set to '-'.
- **Ride (R):** Already empty, but confirm it's clear.

Let me double-check each part:

Original H line: "--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-"
After removal: "----|----|----|----"

Original C line: "O---|----|----|----"
After removal: "----|----|----|----"

R is already empty, so nothing to do there.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have H, C, and R lines all dashes. Let me make sure the structure remains with 16 notes per line and correct separators.
