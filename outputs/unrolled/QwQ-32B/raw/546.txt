Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the ride and kick parts from the given groove.

First, I'll look at the original groove provided. The Kick (K) line has some soft hits (o and --o- patterns). Since the request is to remove kick, I need to replace all the characters in the K line with dashes (-).

Next, the Ride (R) line has a pattern with x and X-x- sequences. Removing ride means setting all those to dashes too.

Now, check the other instruments to ensure they aren't affected. The Snare (S) has X and --X- which are sidestick hits, so those stay. The Hihat (H) has x--- and similar, which are closed hits as per the notation, so those remain. Toms (T) and Crash (C) are already empty, so no changes there.

Wait, let me double-check the original R line: "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-". Changing that to all dashes. And K's "o---|--o-|o---|--o-" becomes all dashes. The rest stay the same. That should meet the user's request without affecting other parts. Let me confirm there's no accidental changes elsewhere. Yep, looks good. Final groove should have K and R lines empty.
