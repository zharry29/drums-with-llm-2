Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to avoid having the snare on the downbeats of beats 2 and 4. 

First, I need to understand the original groove. Looking at the given drum notation:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So, the kick is on the first and third beats (beats 1 and 3), the snare is on beats 2 and 4, and the hihats are closed on every beat. The user wants to remove the snare hits on beats 2 and 4. 

But removing them entirely might leave those beats too sparse. Instead of just erasing them, maybe replace them with something else to maintain the groove. Since the snare is on the downbeats of 2 and 4, perhaps shifting the snare to the off-beats or using a different percussion element there.

Looking at the snare line: S: ----|O---|----|O---. The snare hits are on the second beat (position 5-8th note) and fourth beat (position 13-16th note). To avoid those, we can move the snare to the "and" of the beat or another offbeat. Alternatively, use the tom or ride instead.

But the user specifically mentioned avoiding snare on 2 and 4, so maybe substitute with toms or keep it open. Let me see the instruments available: Toms (T), Ride (R), Crash (C). Since Toms are available and not used here, adding a tom hit on those positions could work. Alternatively, use the ride cymbal for a different texture.

Alternatively, the user might want to keep the snare but move its placement. Let me think of a common approach. In many grooves, avoiding the snare on 2 and 4 can lead to a more syncopated feel. Maybe place the snare on the "and" of 1 and 3, or on the upbeats.

Let me try modifying the snare line. Original snare hits are on beat 2 (second beat's first 16th) and beat 4 (fourth beat's first 16th). To avoid those, perhaps shift the snare to the "&" of 1 and 3, or to the third 16th note of those beats. Alternatively, use a different instrument on those beats.

Option 1: Replace snare on 2 and 4 with toms. So, in the second beat (positions 4-8?), wait, let me parse the notation again. Each beat is four 16th notes. So the first beat is positions 1-4, second 5-8, third 9-12, fourth 13-16.

Snare is at position 5 (beat 2's first 16th) and 13 (beat 4's first 16th). To replace those, maybe put a tom hit there. So in the T line, add O at those positions. Let's see:

Original T line is all dashes. Let's put O on positions 5 and 13. So T: ----|O---|----|O---. But need to check if that's allowed. The user wants to avoid snare there, so replacing with tom is okay.

Alternatively, maybe move the snare to another part. For example, instead of beat 2, put it on the "&" of 1 (position 3) and "&" of 3 (position 11). So the snare would be on positions 3 and 11. That way, the snare isn't on the downbeats of 2 and 4.

So modifying the snare line to S: --O-|--O--|--O--|--O-- (not sure, need to structure it correctly). Wait, let me think in terms of the four beats separated by |.

Original S line is S: ----|O---|----|O---. To move the snare to the "&" of 1 and 3, which are positions 3 and 11. Let's see:

First beat (positions 1-4): "----" → maybe change to "--O-" for snare on the "&" of 1 (position 3).

Third beat (positions 9-12): "----" → change to "--O-" so snare on position 11 (the "&" of 3).

Then the second and fourth beats would have no snare. But then the snare would be on beats 1.&, 3.&. That could work. Let's see:

S: --O-|----|--O-|----

But the user's original had snare on 2 and 4. So replacing with this would take the snare off 2 and 4. Alternatively, maybe spread the snare to other positions. Let me check:

Alternatively, maybe use the hihat or ride for the 2 and 4 hits, but the user didn't mention those. Since the hihats are already closed on every beat, maybe opening them there? But the request is about the snare.

Alternatively, use the tom on 2 and 4 instead of snare. Let's try that. So set S line to remove the snare on 2 and 4, and add Toms there.

So S becomes all dashes except maybe other places. Let's see:

Original S: ----|O---|----|O--- → remove the O's on beats 2 and 4, so S: ----|----|----|----. But that removes all snare. Not good.

Alternatively, keep snare elsewhere. Maybe on the & of 1 and 3. So:

S: --O-|----|--O-|----

Then, to add some hit on 2 and 4, use tom or ride. Let's try adding tom on beats 2 and 4. So T line would have O on positions 5 (beat 2's first 16th) and 13 (beat 4's first 16th). So T: ----|O---|----|O---

That way, the tom takes over the hits that were previously snare on 2 and 4. 

Putting it all together:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: --O-|----|--O-|----
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|O---|----|O---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This way, the snare is now on the "&" of beats 1 and 3, and the toms are on the downbeats of 2 and 4. That should meet the user's request of avoiding snare on 2 and 4.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to keep the snare but just move it. Let me check if there are other positions. Another approach is to have the snare on the upbeats, like the "&" of each beat. But that might be too much. 

Alternatively, maybe shift the snare to the third 16th note of the beat. For example, on beat 2, instead of the first 16th, put it on the third. So S: ----| - - O - | but need to structure it properly.

Wait, let's structure each beat as four 16ths. Let me re-express the S line:

Original S line:

Beat 1: ---- (no snare)
Beat 2: O--- (snare on first 16th)
Beat 3: ---- (no snare)
Beat 4: O--- (snare on first 16th)

To avoid snare on 2 and 4, we can:

- In beat 2, maybe put the snare on the third 16th (position 7?), so O--- becomes --O- ?

Wait, beat 2's positions are 5,6,7,8. So if we want to move the snare hit to the third 16th of beat 2, that would be position 7. So beat 2's S part would be --O- (since first is 5, second 6, third 7, fourth 8). So the snare would be on the third 16th of beat 2.

Similarly, for beat 4, moving the snare to the third 16th (position 15?), so the fourth beat's S would be --O-.

But then the S line would be:

S: ----|--O-|----|--O- 

That way, the snare is on the third 16th of beats 2 and 4, avoiding the downbeat. That could work too. 

Alternatively, maybe the user prefers the snare to be on the "&" (second 16th) of those beats. Let's see:

For beat 2: O--- becomes -O-- (snare on second 16th, the "&" of beat 2). 

Similarly for beat4: O--- becomes -O--.

So S line becomes:

S: ----|-O--|----|-O--

This way, snare is on the "&" of beats 2 and 4, which are off the downbeat. 

Hmm, that might be better since it's still on the strong part of the beat but not exactly the downbeat. The downbeat is the first 16th, so moving it to the second (the "&") is an offbeat but still a strong syncopation. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to remove the snare entirely from 2 and 4 and have it elsewhere. 

I think the best approach is to move the snare hits from the downbeats (first 16th) of 2 and 4 to their "&" (second 16th). That way, the snare is still on the beat but not exactly the downbeat. Let's try that.

So modifying the S line to:

S: ----|-O--|----|-O--

Thus, the new S line would be:

S: ----|-O--|----|-O--

Checking the other lines, the kick is still on 1 and 3, hihats are closed on every beat. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to eliminate the snare on 2 and 4 entirely and place it elsewhere. Let's see:

If we remove the snare from 2 and 4, then the S line would have no hits there, so S: ----|----|----|----

But then we need to compensate for the loss of those hits. Maybe adding a tom or ride there. Let's try adding tom hits on those positions as before.

So combining both ideas:

Snare is moved to the "&" of 1 and 3 (positions 3 and 11) and the "&" of 2 and 4 (positions 6 and 14). Wait, getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the simplest way is to shift the snare from the downbeats of 2 and 4 to their "and" (second 16th). That way, the snare is still present but not on the exact downbeat. 

So the final edit would be:

S line becomes:

S: ----|-O--|----|-O--

Thus, the full drum groove would be:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|-O--|----|-O--
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This way, the snare is on the "&" of beats 2 and 4, avoiding the downbeats as requested. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to remove the snare from those beats entirely and use another instrument. Let me confirm the user's exact request: "avoid having the Snare on the downbeat of 2 and 4". So the snare can be elsewhere on those beats but not on the first 16th note (the downbeat). 

Another option is to have the snare on the third 16th of those beats, so shifted further. 

Alternatively, just remove the snare on 2 and 4, and perhaps add a tom there. Let's try that approach as well.

So S: ----|----|----|----

Then, add Toms on those downbeats:

T line becomes:

T: ----|O---|----|O---

So combining:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|O---|----|O---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

But then the snare is gone from 2 and 4, and replaced with tom. However, the original snare was on 2 and 4, so this removes them entirely and replaces with tom. 

The user might prefer to keep the snare but just move it. So perhaps the first approach of moving to the "&" is better. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to keep the snare on beats 2 and 4 but not on the first 16th. So moving to the third 16th of those beats (like --O- for beat 2's S part). 

Let me structure the beats properly:

Original S line:

Beat 1: ---- (no snare)
Beat 2: O--- (snare on first 16th)
Beat 3: ---- (no snare)
Beat 4: O--- (snare on first 16th)

To move the snare to the third 16th of beats 2 and 4:

Beat 2's S: --O- (third 16th)
Beat 4's S: --O- (third 16th)

So the S line becomes:

S: ----|--O-|----|--O-

Which translates to:

S: ----|--O-|----|--O-

So the full lines:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|--O-|----|--O-
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This way, the snare is on the third 16th of beats 2 and 4, avoiding the downbeats. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the snare on the offbeats like the "&", so second 16th. 

I think either approach is valid. Let me check common drumming practices. Avoiding the snare on the downbeat (the first 16th of the beat) but having it on the "&" (second 16th) is a common way to create a syncopated groove. 

So choosing the second approach where S is:

S: ----|-O--|----|-O--

This would give a more syncopated feel, which might be better. 

Therefore, the final edited drum groove would be:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|-O--|----|-O--
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
