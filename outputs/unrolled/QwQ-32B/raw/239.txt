Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit request. The user wants the groove to include not just the snare but also the toms. Let me first look at the given groove to understand what's there and what needs to be added.

Starting with the Kick (K): The pattern is O---|---o|O-O-|----. So there's a kick on the first 16th note of the first beat, then on the fourth 16th note of the second beat, followed by a kick on the first and third 16th notes of the third beat. The fourth beat has no kick. 

Snare (S): It's on the second beat's first 16th note and the fourth beat's first 16th note. So the snare is hitting on beats 2 and 4, which is standard. 

Hihat (H): The pattern here is --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-. This seems like a mix of open and closed hi-hat hits, but I might need to check if that's intentional. 

Toms (T): Currently all dashes, meaning no toms are being played. The user wants to add toms here. 

Crash (C) and Ride (R): Crash is on the first beat, but ride is silent. 

The task is to add tom hits without removing the snare. Let me think about where to place the toms. Since the snare is on beats 2 and 4, maybe the toms can complement those. Alternatively, they can fill in the space between kicks or add some syncopation. 

Looking at the existing kick pattern, maybe adding toms on offbeats would work. Let's see:

First beat: K is on the first 16th note. Maybe a tom on the third 16th (like O--- becomes O--O?), but that might clash. Alternatively, between the kick and snare. 

Second beat: The kick is on the fourth 16th. The snare is on the first. Maybe a tom on the third 16th here. 

Third beat: Kicks on 1 and 3. Maybe a tom on the second or fourth? 

Fourth beat: No kick, but snare on first. Maybe a tom on the third or fourth 16th.

Alternatively, a tom fill on the last beat to lead into the next measure. 

Alternatively, a steady tom pattern. Since the user might want to add toms in a way that doesn't interfere with the snare. Let's see:

Looking at the first measure (first two beats):

First beat: K on 1, then nothing until the snare on beat 2.1. Maybe a tom on beat 1.3 (third 16th) to add some texture.

Second beat: K on 4, snare on 1. Maybe a tom on 3?

Third beat: Kicks on 1 and 3. Maybe a tom on 2 or 4.

Fourth beat: Snare on 1. Maybe a tom on 3?

Alternatively, maybe a tom on the "and" of each beat where there's space. Let's try:

For the Toms line, let's try placing Os where they can add depth without clashing. Let's go beat by beat.

First beat: O--- (K on 1). Maybe a tom on 3: O--O? But that's where the kick isn't, so maybe that's okay. Alternatively, a soft hit (o) there. 

Second beat: ---o (K on 4). Snare on 1. Maybe a tom on 2 or 3. Let's try O--- for the tom here? Wait, the tom line is separate. Let me structure each beat's four characters.

Breaking down each beat into four 16th notes:

First beat (K: O---):
Positions 1-4: O, -, -, -
Tom could be on 3: O--O? But maybe that's too close to the kick. Alternatively, on 2: O-O-?

Second beat (K: ---o):
Positions 1-4: -, -, -, O (kick on 4)
Snare is on 1. Maybe tom on 3: --O- ?

Third beat (K: O-O-):
Positions 1-4: O, -, O, -
Tom on 2 or 4? Maybe on 4: O-OO?

Fourth beat (K: ----):
Snare on 1. Maybe tom on 3: --O- ?

Alternatively, let's try a pattern that's consistent. For example, adding a tom on every third 16th note where possible. Let me sketch:

T line:

First beat: --O- (so on third 16th)
Second beat: -O-- (on second 16th)
Third beat: -O-- (second 16th)
Fourth beat: --O- (third 16th)

But need to check if that works with the existing instruments. Alternatively, a tom on every other beat's third 16th. Let me try:

T: --O-| -O--| -O--| --O-

But let me see if that's balanced. Alternatively, maybe a tom hit on the "and" of each beat (the second 16th note) where there's space. 

Alternatively, to add some syncopation, maybe:

First beat: O--- (K on 1). Tom on 3: O--O
Second beat: ---o (K on 4). Tom on 2 and 3? Like -OO- 
Third beat: O-O- (K on 1 and 3). Tom on 2: O-O- becomes O-O- (no, same as kick on 3). Maybe on 4: O-OO
Fourth beat: ---- (no kick, snare on 1). Tom on 3: --O- 

But this might be getting too busy. Let's try to make it simple. Maybe adding a tom hit on the third 16th of each beat. That would be:

First beat: --O-
Second beat: --O-
Third beat: --O-
Fourth beat: --O-

So T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O- 

But let me check if that works with the existing parts. The snare is on 2 and 4's first 16th. The kick on 1 of first and third beats. The toms on the third 16th of each beat would add a steady pattern without clashing. That might work. Alternatively, maybe alternate between O and o for dynamics.

Alternatively, maybe on the first and third beats have harder hits, and softer on others. For example:

First beat: O--O (tom on 3, O)
Second beat: -O-- (tom on 2, O)
Third beat: --O- (tom on 3, O)
Fourth beat: --O- (tom on 3, O)

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's pick a simple pattern where toms are added on the offbeats where there's space. Since the user just wants "not only snare but also tom," maybe adding a tom on every beat's third 16th note would suffice. Let's try that.

So Toms line would be:

--O-|--O-|--O-|--O- 

But let me check each beat:

First beat: The tom hits on the third 16th, which is after the kick on 1. That should be okay.

Second beat: Tom on third 16th, which is before the kick on fourth. Also okay.

Third beat: Tom on third 16th, same as kick on third? Wait third beat's kick is on 1 and 3. So if the tom is on 3, that would coincide with the kick. That might be too much. Hmm, so maybe adjust that.

Third beat's kick is O-O-, so positions 1 and 3. If the tom is on position 2 or 4 instead. Let me adjust the third beat's tom to be on position 2: -O--

So:

First beat: --O-
Second beat: --O-
Third beat: -O--
Fourth beat: --O-

Thus, T: --O-|--O-|-O--|--O- 

But let's see:

Third beat's tom is on the second 16th, which is between the first and third kick hits. That might work. 

Alternatively, maybe on the fourth 16th of the third beat (position 4): O--O ?

Wait third beat's kick is O-O- (positions 1 and 3). So position 4 is free. 

Hmm, this is getting a bit complex. Maybe the simplest way is to add a tom hit every third 16th note except where it clashes with kick. Let me try:

First beat: --O- (tom on 3)
Second beat: --O- (tom on 3)
Third beat: ---O (tom on 4, to avoid clashing with kick on 3)
Fourth beat: --O- (tom on 3)

So T: --O-|--O-|---O|--O- 

That way, on the third beat's fourth 16th, the tom is after the kick on 3. 

Alternatively, maybe use soft hits (o) to not overpower. Let me write the T line as:

T: --o-|--o-|---o|--o- 

But using O for harder hits might be better for definition. 

Alternatively, let's see if the user's previous edits give a pattern. Looking at the history, when adding toms, they often placed Os in a repeating pattern, like ---O in each beat. For example, in previous answers, they used something like ---O repeated, or --O- etc. 

Wait in one of the previous examples, when adding toms to a similar structure, the assistant used:

T: ---O|---O|---O|---O

But in another case, they used --O-| etc. 

Maybe a simple pattern like adding a tom on the last 16th of each beat. So each beat's last 16th note has a tom hit. That would be:

T: ---O|---O|---O|---O

But let's see how that fits:

First beat: K is on 1. The tom on 4 would be after the kick, which is okay.

Second beat: K on 4. Tom on 4 would coincide with the kick. That's bad. So can't do that.

Hmm, so maybe on third 16th of each beat except where it clashes.

Alternatively, on the second and fourth 16th of each beat. Let's see:

T: -O-O|-O-O|-O-O|-O-O 

But that might be too busy.

Alternatively, just on the first and third beats' third 16th, and second and fourth's second 16th. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's look at the snare positions. Since the snare is on beat 2 and 4's first 16th, maybe the toms can be on the third 16th of those beats to complement.

Alternatively, here's another approach. Let's add a tom hit on the third 16th of each beat except where there's a kick. 

First beat: third 16th is free (since kick is on 1), so tom there.

Second beat: third 16th is free (kick is on 4), so tom there.

Third beat: third 16th is where kick is (position 3), so maybe tom on 2 or 4. Let's pick 2.

Fourth beat: third 16th is free (no kick), so tom there.

So the T line would be:

--O-|--O-|-O--|--O- 

Which translates to:

First beat: positions 3 (O)
Second beat: 3 (O)
Third beat: 2 (O)
Fourth beat: 3 (O)

So the Toms line would be:

T: --O-|--O-|-O--|--O-

Alternatively, using O for hard hits. 

Alternatively, to make it more consistent, maybe on every third 16th except third beat. But the third beat's third is a kick, so maybe the tom on third beat is on the fourth 16th. 

Alternatively, the third beat's tom on fourth 16th:

T: --O-|--O-|---O|--O-

This way, the third beat's tom is on the fourth 16th, after the kick on 3. 

This seems reasonable. Let me write that out:

T line:

First beat: --O- (third 16th)
Second beat: --O- (third)
Third beat: ---O (fourth)
Fourth beat: --O- (third)

So the Toms line would be:

T: --O-|--O-|---O|--O-

This way, the toms are placed consistently except where they'd clash with the kick on the third beat. 

Let me also check if the crash and ride are okay. The crash is on the first beat, but the tom there is on third 16th, so no clash. 

Alternatively, maybe using a soft hit (o) instead of O to keep it from being too loud. But the user might prefer harder hits for toms. 

Another consideration is the hihat pattern. The H line has some open and closed hits, but the toms should complement that. 

Alternatively, maybe adding a tom on the first 16th of each beat where there's no kick. Like on the second and fourth beats first 16th. But the snare is on those first 16ths, so that would clash. 

Hmm, okay. Let me go with the above pattern. 

Thus, the final Toms line would be:

T: --O-|--O-|---O|--O-

Let me check each beat:

Beat 1: K on 1, tom on 3. Good.
Beat 2: K on 4, tom on 3. Good.
Beat 3: K on 1 and 3, tom on 4. Good.
Beat 4: Snare on 1, tom on 3. Good.

That should work without clashing and adds tom hits in each beat except where it would conflict with kick. 

Alternatively, maybe on the third beat, having a tom on the fourth 16th adds a nice ending to the beat. 

So the final drum groove with the added toms would look like this:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: --O-|--O-|---O|--O-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
