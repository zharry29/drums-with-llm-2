Okay, let's see. The user wants me to add ghost notes on the Snare drum to the given drum groove. First, I need to recall what ghost notes are. From the notation guide, ghost notes on the snare are typically soft hits, which are represented by 'o' in the S line. The original groove has the snare playing hard hits (O) on the 3rd beat of each measure, but no other notes. To add ghost notes, I should place soft hits (o) in between the existing hard hits to create a more dynamic and textured feel.

Looking at the original S line: "----|O---|----|O---". The snare only hits on the third 16th note of the second and fourth beats. To add ghost notes, I can place 'o's on the offbeats. For example, between the existing hits. Let's break down each beat:

First beat: "----" (no snare). Maybe add some ghost notes here? But the user might want to keep the original placement, so maybe start adding from the second beat where the original snare is.

Second beat: "O---". The hard hit is on the first 16th note of the beat. Ghost notes could be on the 8th notes in between. Like "-o-O---" but need to fit the 16th notes. Wait, each beat is four 16th notes. So the second beat's snare is on the first 16th note (position 1). To add ghost notes, maybe on positions 3 and 4? Or spread them out. Alternatively, on the "and" of each beat.

Alternatively, a common ghost note pattern is to have them on the "e" and "ah" of each beat. For example, on the second beat, the original has an O on the first 16th. So positions 1-4 for that beat: O - - -. To add ghost notes, maybe on positions 2 and 4? Like O o - o? But that might interfere. Alternatively, O - o -, but need to see the flow.

Alternatively, let's consider each beat as four 16th notes. The user's request is to add ghost notes, so perhaps inserting 'o's in the gaps. Let me think of a typical ghost note pattern like on the "e" and "ah" of each beat. For the second beat (which has the O on the first 16th), maybe add two ghost notes after it. So the second beat's snare would be O o - o? But that might not fit well. Alternatively, maybe O - o -.

Wait, perhaps a common approach is to have the ghost notes on the offbeats. For example, in a 4/4 groove, the snare might have a backbeat on 2 and 4, with ghost notes in between. Since the original has the snare on beats 2 and 4 (third 16th note of each beat?), wait, actually looking back:

Original S line: S: ----|O---|----|O---. Each bar is four beats separated by |. So first beat: "----" (no snare), second beat: "O---" (snare hit on the first 16th of the second beat), third beat: "----", fourth beat: "O---". So the snare is on beat 2 and 4, first 16th note of those beats. To add ghost notes, perhaps between the kick and snare hits or around the existing hits.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the ghost notes to be around the main snare hits. For example, on the eighth notes around the snare hit. Let's consider each measure divided into four beats, each with four 16th notes.

Let me think of the second beat where the snare is on the first 16th note. To add ghost notes, maybe on the third and fourth 16th notes of that beat? Or on the second and fourth? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe adding two ghost notes before the main snare hit? But that might clash. Alternatively, after.

Alternatively, a common ghost note pattern for a backbeat could be something like on the "and" of the previous beat and the "and" of the current beat. For example, if the snare is on beat 2, then ghost notes on 1-and and 2-e?

Alternatively, perhaps inserting 'o's on the even-numbered 16th notes. Let me try to draft:

Original S line:
Beat 1: ----
Beat 2: O---
Beat 3: ----
Beat 4: O---

To add ghost notes, maybe on the 8th notes in between. Let's think in terms of each beat's four 16th notes:

For beat 2 (O---): positions 1-4 are O, -, -, -. To add ghost notes, perhaps on positions 2 and 4: O o - o ?

But that might make it O-o-o? Wait, each beat is four characters. So beat 2 would be O o - o? But that would be four characters. Alternatively, O - o -, but that's O - o -, so the third 16th note is a ghost note. Hmm. Maybe that's better.

Alternatively, maybe on the "e" and "ah" of the beat. Let's think of the 16th notes as 1 e & a. So for beat 2:

1 (O), e (ghost?), & (ghost?), a (ghost?).

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants a pattern like O o o o for beat 2? But that might be too busy. Alternatively, adding a couple of ghost notes before the main hit? Wait, the main hit is on the first 16th of the beat. So maybe on the previous beat's last 16th note?

Alternatively, maybe the ghost notes can be placed on the offbeats. Let me consider each measure's four beats. Since the original has snare on beat 2 and 4, first and third beats are empty. Maybe adding ghost notes on the first and third beats as well?

Wait, the user's instruction says "add some ghost notes on the Snare", so maybe just on the existing snare hits' beats? Or spread throughout?

Hmm. Let me try to create a pattern. Let's go beat by beat.

First beat (no snare): Maybe add a ghost note on the 3rd 16th? Like - - o - ?

Second beat (O---): Add ghosts after the main hit. So O - o - ?

Third beat (no snare): Maybe a ghost on the 2nd and 4th? Like - o - o ?

Fourth beat (O---): Similar to second, O - o - ?

But need to ensure it's balanced. Alternatively, a common ghost note pattern is to have them on the "e" and "a" of each beat. For example, in a 4/4 with 16th notes:

Beat 1: 1 e & a

So for beat 2, the main snare is on 1. Ghost notes could be on e and a: so positions 2 and 4.

Thus, beat 2 would be O o - o ?

Wait, that would be O (position1), o (2), - (3), o (4). That might work.

Similarly, on beat 4: O o - o ?

For the first and third beats (which are originally empty), maybe adding some ghost notes as well to create a more continuous feel. For example, on beat 1: - o - o, and beat 3: - o - o ?

Putting it all together:

S line would be:

Beat1: -o-o

Beat2: Oo-o

Wait, no. Let me structure each beat as four characters separated by |.

Original S: ----|O---|----|O---

Adding ghost notes:

First beat (----): Maybe -o-o ?

Second beat (O---): O o - o ?

Wait, but the second beat's first character is O, then positions 2,3,4. So O o - o would be four characters. So beat2 becomes Oo-o ?

Wait, let's write each beat as four characters:

First beat: "-o-o"

Second beat: "O o o" ? No, need four characters. Let's see:

First beat: - o - o (positions 1-4)

Second beat: O - o o (positions 1-4)

Wait, maybe:

First beat: - o - o

Second beat: O - o -

Third beat: - o - o

Fourth beat: O - o -

But that might vary. Alternatively, to keep it simple, adding two ghost notes per beat where possible.

Alternatively, let's try:

S: -o-o | O-o- | -o-o | O-o-

This way, each beat has two ghost notes except where the main hit is. For the second beat, the main O is on the first 16th, then a ghost on the third? So O - - o? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the ghost notes to be around the main hits. For the snare hits on beat 2 and 4, adding a ghost before and after. For example:

On beat 2: the O is on the first 16th. So maybe add a ghost on the fourth 16th of the previous beat (beat1's fourth 16th?), but that's part of the first beat's last note.

Alternatively, on beat2: O - o - 

So the second beat's snare would be O, then a ghost on the third 16th.

Similarly, on beat4: O - o - 

For the first and third beats, adding ghost notes on the second and fourth 16th notes: - o - o 

Putting it all together:

S: -o-o | O - o - | -o-o | O - o - 

Wait, but each beat is four characters. Let me format it properly with | separators.

So the S line would be:

S: -o-o | O-o- | -o-o | O-o-

Wait, let's count:

First beat: "-o-o" (four characters)

Second beat: "O-o-" (O is first, then -, o, -? Wait, O followed by -, then o, then -. So O - o - â†’ "O-o-".

Third beat: "-o-o"

Fourth beat: "O-o-"

So the full S line would be:

S: -o-o|O-o-|-o-o|O-o-

This way, the main snare hits are still on the first 16th of beats 2 and 4, but with ghost notes added on the third 16th of those beats. Additionally, the first and third beats have ghost notes on the 2nd and 4th 16th notes.

Does this make sense? The ghost notes are soft hits (o) which add some texture without overpowering the main hits. It's a common way to add ghost notes in drumming, especially in rock or funk styles. I think this should fulfill the request of adding ghost notes while keeping the main snare placement intact.
