Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to have not only cymbal but also ride. Looking at the given groove:

First, check the current instruments. The Kick (K) has some hits, Snare (S) too, but Hihat (H) and Toms (T) are silent. Crash (C) is also silent, and Ride (R) has some pattern with "o-O-" repeating.

Wait, the user mentioned "not only cymbal but also ride". Wait, the original request might have a typo? Because "cymbal" could refer to Crash, but the user might want both Crash and Ride? Or maybe they meant that the groove currently has cymbals (like Crash) but needs Ride added? Let me look again.

The original groove's C line is all dashes except the first beat of each measure with "O---|O---|O---|O---". Wait, no, in the given groove, the C line is actually all dashes except maybe I misread. Wait, looking at the user's input:

The given groove is:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

Ah, here, Crash (C) is completely silent. The Ride (R) has some hits. So the user is saying that the groove currently has cymbal (maybe referring to Ride?) but they want both cymbal (Crash?) and Ride. Wait, perhaps the user wants to add Ride in addition to Crash? But the original instruction says "not only cymbal but also ride". Since the current C is silent, maybe they want to add Crash and Ride? Or maybe the user wants to replace Crash with Ride? Hmm.

Wait, the original request says "not only cymbal but also ride". Since "cymbal" is a general term, and Ride is a type of cymbal. But perhaps the user wants both Crash and Ride cymbals. Since currently, only Ride is active (R line has o-O-), but Crash is silent. So maybe the user wants to add Crash cymbal in addition to Ride. Alternatively, maybe the user thinks that currently, only Crash is present, but that's not the case here. 

Wait, in the given groove, the Crash (C) line is all dashes, so no Crash. The Ride (R) is active. So the groove has Ride (a cymbal) but the user wants both cymbals (like Crash and Ride). So the edit would be to add Crash hits where appropriate, while keeping the Ride.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the groove currently has only cymbal (like only Ride) and wants to add another cymbal like Crash. So the instruction is to add Crash in addition to Ride.

So the task is to add Crash cymbal (C line) in some places, while keeping the existing Ride (R). Let's see.

The Kick and Snare have their own patterns. The user's edit should not disrupt those. The current R has a pattern of "o-O-" each beat, which is a soft open hit followed by a hard open hit on the bell, then two rests? Wait, "o-O-" would be o on the first 16th, O on the second, then two dashes. That's a possible ride pattern.

To add Crash, typically crashes are hit on strong beats like the first beat of a measure or on downbeats. Let's see the structure. The bar is 4 beats, each with 4 16th notes.

The C line is all dashes now. Let's pick spots for Crash. Maybe hit Crash on the first beat of each measure, so in the first 16th note of each bar. So for each measure, the first note of C would be an O (hard hit). That would give C: O---|O---|O---|O---. But maybe vary it. Alternatively, maybe add a Crash on the first beat of the first and third measures, and not the others. Or maybe on the 3rd beat? Let me think.

Alternatively, since the existing R has a pattern, maybe add Crash on the downbeats where the Kick is hitting. For example, in the first beat, the Kick has O--O. The first 16th is O (Kick hit). So maybe Crash on the first 16th of the first beat (measure 1, first 16th). Similarly, check where else the Kick is strong.

Looking at K: O--O|----|--O-|----
First measure: O--O (first 16th is O)
Second measure: ---- (no kick)
Third measure: --O- (third 16th is O)
Fourth measure: ---- (no kick)

So perhaps add Crash on the first 16th of the first measure, third 16th of third measure. So:

C: O---|----|---O|----

Alternatively, to make it consistent, maybe every measure's first 16th. But since the second and fourth measures have no Kick, maybe only where there is a Kick. Alternatively, just add Crash on the first beat of each bar for emphasis. Let's go with that for simplicity.

So set C to have O on the first 16th of each measure:

C: O---|O---|O---|O---

That would add Crash on each downbeat. Then, the Ride remains as is. So the edited groove would have both Crash and Ride cymbals.

Wait, but the user's instruction was "not only cymbal but also ride". Since Ride is already present, maybe they wanted to add another cymbal (Crash) in addition. So that makes sense.

Therefore, the final edit would be adding Crash hits on the first 16th of each measure, so the C line becomes O--- in each beat section. Thus, the final answer would be the original with C line filled with O's and R remains as before.
