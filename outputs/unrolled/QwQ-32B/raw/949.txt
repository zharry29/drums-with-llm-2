Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the ride on beat 4, but keep everything else the same. Let me look at the given groove first.

The original groove is:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, actually, looking at the R line (Ride cymbal), it's all dashes except maybe the last beat? Let me check again. The user provided:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So the Ride (R) line is all dashes. Hmm, the user says "I don't want ride on beat 4". But in the original, there's no ride on any beat. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check.

Wait, the user's provided groove's R line is all dashes. So maybe there was a mistake in the problem setup? But the user's edit request is about removing ride on beat 4. Since the original has no ride, perhaps there was a typo, but I should proceed as per the given data.

Wait, perhaps in the original, the ride is present? Let me check again. The user's input shows R as all dashes except maybe the last beat? Wait, the R line in the given groove is:

R: ----|----|----|----

So no ride hits at all. Then the user's request is to remove ride on beat 4, but there's nothing to remove. Maybe the user intended to have ride hits but there's an error in the input? Alternatively, maybe the user wants to ensure that even if there were, they are removed. Since the original has none, the edited version remains the same. But perhaps I should confirm the problem again.

Wait, perhaps I misread the given groove. Let me check again carefully:

The user's given groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, the Ride (R) line is all dashes. So there's no ride hit on beat 4 or any other beat. Therefore, the edit request doesn't require any changes. The user might have thought there was a ride on beat 4, but according to the given data, there isn't. Therefore, the edited groove remains exactly the same as the original. But since the user is asking to remove ride on beat4, and there's none, the answer should just repeat the original. However, maybe there was a mistake in the input, and the user intended the ride to be present. But as per the given data, I have to proceed with what's provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's original had a ride on beat4 which was missed in the input. But given the data, I must work with that. Therefore, the final answer would be the same as the original.
