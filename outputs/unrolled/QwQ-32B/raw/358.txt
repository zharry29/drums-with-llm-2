Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any kick or cymbal parts. First, I'll look at each line of the given drum notation.

Starting with the Kick (K line): It has "O--O|----|--O-|----". Since the user doesn't want kick, I'll replace all those characters with '-' to mute them. 

Next, the Snare (S line): "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o". Snare is allowed, so I'll leave this as is unless there's a cymbal involved here, but no, S is okay.

Hihat (H line): All dashes, so no change needed here.

Toms (T line): Also all dashes, so no action.

Crash (C line): All dashes, so removing it is straightforward by keeping '-'.

Ride (R line): "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-". Since Ride is a cymbal, I need to replace all those hits with '-'.

Wait, but the user specified no cymbals, which includes Ride (R) and Crash (C). Both C and R lines should be cleared. Let me double-check:

Original C line is all dashes, so that's fine. The R line has the ride hits, so replacing those with '-'.

Putting it all together, the edited version should have K and R lines cleared, others as original except S which stays. Let me verify each line again to ensure no mistakes.
