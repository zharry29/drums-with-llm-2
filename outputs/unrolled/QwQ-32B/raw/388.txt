Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any snare or hihat parts. First, I need to recall the original groove's structure. 

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user's request is to eliminate the snare (S) and hihat (H). So, I need to set all their entries to '-'.

Starting with the Snare (S) line: Currently, in the third beat, there's an O---. Changing that to ----. The rest are already empty, so the S line becomes all dashes.

For the Hihat (H), all current entries are dashes, so no change there. Wait, checking again: The original H line is all dashes, so that's already okay. 

Now, the Kick (K) and Toms (T) are still present. The user didn't mention removing those, so they stay. 

Wait, double-checking the user's instruction: "I don't want any snare or hihat." So only S and H should be cleared. 

So the edited version should have:

K remains as is: O---|O---|----|O---
S becomes all dashes: ----|----|----|----
H is already all dashes, so stays: ----|----|----|----
Toms stay: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C and R are already empty, so no change.

Wait, but the original Toms (T) are playing. The user didn't mention toms, so they stay. The user only wants snare and hihat removed. 

So putting it all together, the final groove should look like:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

That's it. Just ensure that S and H are all dashes. Let me confirm once more. The original S had an O in the third beat's first hit, so that needs to be changed to '-'. The rest were already clear. H was already clear. Yes, that's correct.
