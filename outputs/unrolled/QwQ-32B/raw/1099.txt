Okay, so the user wants to make this drum groove have more low-frequency sounds. Let me start by looking at the original groove they provided.

First, I'll check each instrument's line to see where the hits are. The Kick drum (K) has some hits: "O--O|----|--O-|----". That's a hard hit on the first 16th note, then another on the fourth, then a soft hit on the 13th and 14th? Wait, no, let me parse that again. Each | separates beats, so each segment is 4 characters (16th notes). The first segment is "O--O", so that's hits on the 1st and 4th 16th notes of the first beat. The third beat has "--O-" so that's a hit on the third 16th note. The kick is already contributing some low end, but maybe it can be beefed up.

The Snare (S) has "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o". Snare is mid-range, so adding more low-end might mean reducing snare or adding more kick or toms. But the user wants more low, so maybe focus on Kick and Toms.

The Hihat (H) is active with "X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-", which is closed hits, providing a steady rhythm but not low. Since the user wants more lows, maybe the hihat can be reduced or replaced, but the edit request doesn't mention that, so perhaps leave it as is unless necessary.

Toms (T) are all dashes, so they're not being used. Toms are low to mid-low, so adding toms here could help. The user's request is to add more low frequencies, so adding tom hits where appropriate would be good. Let's see where to place them.

The Crash (C) and Ride (R) are inactive, so they don't contribute to low end. 

So the plan is to reinforce the kick and add toms. Let's look at the kick pattern. Maybe make the kick hits harder (O instead of o) where possible, but the original has some O's already. Alternatively, add more kick hits. Also, adding toms on offbeats or in sync with the kick could add depth.

Looking at the kick's first segment "O--O", maybe adding an O on the third 16th note? But that might clash. Alternatively, in the third beat "--O-", perhaps making that an O instead of o? Wait, the third beat's third 16th is O? Wait, in the K line: the third segment is "--O-", so the third 16th note is O, which is a hard hit. The fourth segment is "--O-" again? Wait, the original K line is "O--O|----|--O-|----". Wait, the fourth segment is the last one, which is "----", so no hits there. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the kick to have more consistent hits.

Alternatively, add tom hits on the offbeats. Let's see the structure. Each bar is 4 beats. Let's look at each beat:

Beat 1: K has hits on 1 and 4. Maybe add a tom on 3? Or maybe on 2?

Beat 2: K has no hits. That's a problem because that beat is silent for kick. The user wants more low, so adding kick here would help. Let's add a kick on beat 2, maybe O on the first 16th note of beat 2? So changing the second segment (which is currently "----") to "O---" or similar?

Wait, the original K line is "O--O|----|--O-|----". So beat 2 has no kick. That's a big gap. Adding a kick there would definitely add more low. Let's make beat 2 have a kick on the first 16th note. So changing the second segment from "----" to "O---", making it O on the first 16th. 

Also, the third beat has "--O-", so a kick on the third 16th of beat 3. The fourth beat has no kick. Maybe adding a kick on the first 16th of beat 4 as well.

So modifying the kick to be more consistent. Let's try:

K: O--O|O---|--O-|O--- 

Wait, but each segment is 4 characters. Let's see:

Original K line:
Beat1: O--O
Beat2: ----
Beat3: --O-
Beat4: ----

So after changes, maybe:

Beat1: O--O (unchanged)
Beat2: O--- (hit on first 16th)
Beat3: --O- (unchanged)
Beat4: O--- (hit on first 16th)

That would make the kick hit on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4's first 16th, plus the original hits on 1's 4th and 3's third. Hmm, but that might be too busy. Alternatively, maybe make the kick hit on every beat's first 16th. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe add a tom on the offbeats where the kick isn't hitting. For example, in beat 1, the kick hits 1 and 4. Maybe a tom on 3? So T: ---O for beat 1? But need to check the structure.

Alternatively, since toms are currently inactive, let's map the tom hits to complement the kick. For instance, where the kick is silent, add a tom. In beat 2, since kick is now added on first 16th, maybe a tom on the third 16th. Or perhaps a tom on the & of the beat (the second 16th). 

Alternatively, add a tom on each beat's third 16th note, which is the "&" of the beat. Let's see:

For each beat:

Beat1: K hits 1 and 4. Maybe T on 3.

Beat2: K hits 1, so T on 3.

Beat3: K hits 3, so maybe T on 1? Or 4?

Beat4: K hits 1, so T on 3 again.

Alternatively, toms on the "&" of each beat. So T: -O-- for each beat? Let's see:

If each tom segment is "-O--", then over four beats:

T: -O--| -O-- | -O-- | -O--

But that would be a tom on the second 16th of each beat. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a consistent pattern like O--- for toms, but that might clash with kick.

Alternatively, let's think of the toms playing on the offbeats where the kick isn't. For example, in beat 1, kick is on 1 and 4. So tom on 3. Then in beat2, kick on 1, so tom on 3. Beat3, kick on 3, so tom on 1 or 4. Beat4, kick on 1, so tom on 3. 

This way, toms fill in the gaps between kicks. Let's try:

For each beat:

Beat1: K hits 1,4 → T on 3 → segment for T: --O-

Beat2: K hits 1 → T on 3 → --O-

Beat3: K hits 3 → T on 1? → O---

Beat4: K hits 1 → T on 3 → --O-

But this might not be consistent. Alternatively, maybe a steady tom on the & (second 16th) of each beat. Let's see.

Alternatively, let's try adding toms on every third 16th note across the bar. So T: --O- for each beat. That would be T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-.

Combined with the modified kick, this could add more low end.

Also, check the original T line was all dashes, so adding that would help.

Additionally, maybe make some of the kick hits harder. In the original K line, there's an "o" in the third beat's third 16th. Wait, the third segment is "--O-", so that's an O (hard hit). The first segment has O--O, so first hit is O, fourth is O. The fourth segment was originally dashes, but we changed it to O---, so that's an O there.

Alternatively, perhaps make all kick hits hard (O) where possible, and add more of them.

Putting it all together:

Modified K: O--O|O---|--O-|O--- (adding kicks in beats 2 and 4)

Toms: --O- repeated each beat (so T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O- )

This way, the toms fill in the third 16th of each beat, adding low frequencies. The kick is more consistent across all beats, and toms add another layer.

Wait, let me check the counts again. Each beat is four 16ths. So for Toms:

Beat1: --O- → hit on third 16th.

Beat2: --O- → same.

Beat3: --O- → same.

Beat4: --O- → same.

So tom hits every third 16th, which is the "&" of the beat (since 1, 2, 3,4 → 3 is the "&").

This would create a steady tom pattern that complements the kick. Additionally, the kick now has hits on beats 1,2,3,4's first 16th, plus the original hits on 1's 4th and 3's third.

Wait, but in the modified K line I suggested, the first beat is O--O (hits 1 and 4), second is O--- (hit 1), third is --O- (hit3), fourth is O--- (hit1). So the kick hits on 1,4 (beat1), 1 (beat2), 3 (beat3), 1 (beat4). That's okay, but maybe the second beat's kick on 1 is good, and the tom on 3 adds to it.

Alternatively, maybe the kick on beat2 could have a harder hit, but that's already O.

Another consideration: the original snare has some hits. Let me check the S line:

S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o

So beat2 has Oo-o, which is a hard hit on the first 16th, soft open on the second and third? Wait, the segment is "Oo-o". So first 16th is O (hard hit), second o (soft open), third o (soft open), fourth dash. Hmm, that might be a bit much. But since the user didn't mention the snare, maybe leave it as is.

Putting it all together, the edited drum groove would have more kick and tom hits, which should increase the low frequencies. Let me write this out in the notation.

So K: O--O|O---|--O-|O--- (each beat's first 16th, plus original hits)

Wait, let's write each segment properly:

Original K was:

Beat1: O--O (O on 1 and 4)

Beat2: ---- (no hits)

Beat3: --O- (O on 3)

Beat4: ---- (no hits)

Modified K to add kicks in beat2 and 4's first 16th:

Beat1: O--O

Beat2: O--- (hit on 1)

Beat3: --O- (unchanged)

Beat4: O--- (hit on1)

So K line becomes:

K: O--O|O---|--O-|O---

Then Toms: --O- on each beat:

T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-

That's four segments of "--O-", separated by |.

This should add consistent tom hits on the third 16th of each beat, providing more low-end.

Additionally, maybe make some of the tom hits harder (O) or softer (o). Since the user wants more low, using hard hits (O) would be better.

Alternatively, maybe add more tom hits. For instance, in beat1, since the kick hits 1 and 4, maybe a tom on 3 (already there) and maybe another on 2? But that might be too much. Let's stick to the --O- pattern for simplicity.

Double-checking the counts to ensure it's 16 characters. Each segment is 4 characters, 4 segments: 4x4=16. Yes.

So the final edited groove would have the kick hits as above and toms added. Let me write that in the @@@ block.
