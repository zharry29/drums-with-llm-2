Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a drum groove in a specific notation and wants me to edit it by removing any parts related to the snare (S) and hihat (H). The final output should only include the remaining instruments: Kick (K), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R). 

First, I need to recall the structure of the drum notation. Each line corresponds to an instrument, with each character representing a 16th note. The | separates beats into 4 parts. The user's request is straightforward: eliminate any hits from the snare and hihat lines. That means setting all characters in the S and H lines to '-' (no hit). 

Looking at the given groove:

Original Groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The S line has some X and - characters, and the H line has x and -. To comply with the request, I'll replace all non '-' characters in S and H with '-'. 

For the S line:
Original: " ----|X---|--X-|---- "
After edit: " ----|----|----|---- " 

For the H line:
Original: " ----|x---|----|x--- "
After edit: " ----|----|----|---- "

The other lines (K, T, C, R) remain unchanged unless there's a dependency, but the user only mentioned removing snare and hihat, so I leave them as is. 

Wait, the R line has some x and X characters. Since the user didn't mention ride, those stay. Similarly, the crash (C) line is empty, so no change there. 

Let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss any characters. The Toms (T) are all '-', so they remain silent unless the user wanted to add something, but the instruction is to remove snare and hihat only. 

Putting it all together, the edited groove should look like:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

I need to ensure that each line has exactly 16 characters (excluding the |). Let me count:

For S line: Each segment is 4 characters. The line has four segments separated by |, so 4*4=16. The edited S line is all dashes, so that's correct.

Same for H line. The R line's segments are "x---", "X-x-", "x---", "X-x-". Each is 4 characters. Let's check:

First segment: "x---" (4), second "X-x-" (4), third "x---" (4), fourth "X-x-" (4). Total 16. Correct.

Therefore, the final edited groove meets the requirements.
