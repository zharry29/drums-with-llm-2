Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a specific drum notation and wants me to remove any hihat or snare from the given groove. 

First, I need to recall the instruments each line represents. The lines are:

- K: Kick drum
- S: Snare drum
- H: Hihat
- T: Toms
- C: Crash cymbal
- R: Ride cymbal

The user's request is to eliminate both the hihat (H) and snare (S). So, I'll need to set all their entries to '-' characters, indicating no hits. 

Looking at the provided drum groove:

@@@
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

I notice that the S line already has all '-' characters, so snare is already inactive. However, the H line has some hits (x--- and x---). I need to clear those out. 

So, for the H line, I'll replace every non-'-' character with '-'. The rest of the instruments (K, T, C, R) can stay as they are unless they're also supposed to be removed, but the request only mentions hihat and snare.

Wait, let me double-check the user's instruction: "I don't want any hihat or snare." So, S and H lines should be all '-'. The other lines (K, T, C, R) should remain as they are unless specified otherwise. 

Looking at the R line, there are some hits (x and X), which are ride cymbal articulations. Since ride isn't mentioned in the removal request, those stay. Similarly, the C line is empty, so no changes there. The K and T lines are also inactive except for possible other parts, but in this case, they're all '-'.

Wait, in the original groove provided by the user, the K line is all '-', T is all '-', C is all '-', so the only active instruments besides H and S (which are being removed) are R. Since R is allowed, we just need to zero out H and S.

Therefore, modifying the H line to all '-' and ensuring S remains all '-'. Let me write that out.

Final check: 

- S line remains all '-'.
- H line becomes all '-'.
- Others stay the same.

So the edited groove should look like:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

I think that's it. Just making sure I didn't miss any characters in the H line. The original H had "----|x---|----|x---", so changing those x's to '-' in each beat.
