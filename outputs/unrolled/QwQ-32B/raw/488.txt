Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the ride and hihat parts from the given groove. 

First, I need to recall the original groove structure. Let me look at the provided notation again. The kick (K) has some hits like O--O and --O-. The snare (S) has Oo-o, -o--, O--o, etc. The hihat (H) is using X-x- in each beat, which are closed hits. The ride (R) is empty here, but maybe the user still wants to ensure it's cleared.

The user's request is to remove any ride or hihat. So, I need to set all H and R lines to all '-' characters. Let me check each line:

- K: remains as is since it's kick, which is allowed.
- S: stays because it's snare, which isn't being removed.
- H: needs to be cleared. The original has X-x- in each beat, so replacing those with '----'.
- T: toms are okay if they were there, but in this case, they're empty.
- C: crash is present but not mentioned in the request, so leave it unless instructed otherwise.
- R: ride is to be removed, so set all to '-'.

Wait, in the given groove, R is already all '----', so no change there. The main task is to clear the H line. Let me verify each part:

Original H line: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
After removal: should be ----|----|----|----

So the final edited groove should have H and R lines empty. Let me reconstruct the entire notation accordingly. Double-check that other instruments (K, S, T, C) remain untouched. Since T and C were already empty, they stay as is. The snare's patterns stay, and kick too. 

Yes, that should do it. The user didn't mention anything about crashes, so leaving C as is is correct. The key is to ensure H and R are all dashes.
