Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a ride hit and crash cymbal in the very beginning. Let me start by recalling the original groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----

The user's request is to add a ride hit and a crash cymbal at the start. The first beat is "O---" for the kick and "----" for snare, hihat is "X---", and the crash and ride are silent. 

First, the "very beginning" would be the first 16th note of the first beat. So, for the ride (R line), I need to place an articulation on the first note. Since the user mentioned "ride hit", using the default for ride is O (hard open hit on the bell). 

Then, the crash (C line) also needs a hit at the same time. The crash's hard hit is O. 

So, changing the first character of both C and R lines to O. Let's check the notation rules again to confirm:

- R: O is a hard open hit on the bell. That's appropriate for a strong hit at the start.
- C: O is a hard hit. Perfect for the crash.

But wait, the user said "ride hit and cymbal". Since crash is a cymbal, that's covered. But maybe they want both crash and ride? That's the interpretation here.

So modifying the first characters of C and R lines:

Original C: ---- becomes O---
Original R: ---- becomes O---

Wait, but maybe the user wants both crash and ride in the beginning. That makes sense for a strong start. Let me check previous examples. In prior interactions, when similar requests were made, adding both was acceptable. 

So the edited lines would be:

C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

But let me double-check if there's any conflict. The kick has an O on the first note, so having a crash and ride hit there is okay. It might be a bit busy, but the user asked for both, so that's the way to go.

Final check: The hihat is already X--- in the first beat, which is a closed hit. That's fine. The snare is silent in the first beat, so the main hits are kick, hihat, crash, and ride. That should fulfill the request.
