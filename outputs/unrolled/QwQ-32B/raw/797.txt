Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a tom hit and ride in the very beginning. Let me first look at the given groove to understand what's there.

The original groove has:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So the kick starts with O--O on the first beat. The snare has some activity starting in the second beat. The hihats are closed hits (X-x-), and there are no toms or ride playing yet. The user wants a tom hit and ride in the very beginning, which is the first 16th note of the bar.

First, for the tom hit. The Toms line (T) is all dashes right now. To add a tom hit at the very beginning, I need to place an 'O' (hard hit) on the first 16th note. So the first segment (before the first |) would be O--- for Toms. Since the user mentioned "tom hit," a hard hit (O) is probably appropriate unless specified otherwise.

Next, the ride. The Ride cymbal (R) is all dashes. The user wants a ride hit in the beginning. Looking at the Ride's notation, O is a hard open hit on the bell. To start with a ride hit on the first 16th note, I should put an 'O' there. So the Ride line would start with O---.

I need to check if there's any conflict with existing hits. The kick has an O on the first 16th note. Adding a tom and ride there might be okay, but let me see the instruments. The kick is O (hard), tom O (hard), and ride O (hard bell hit) all on the same 16th note. That's three simultaneous hits. Depending on the desired feel, this could be acceptable or too busy. But since the user specifically asked for both, I'll proceed.

So modifying T and R lines:

T: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

Wait, but the original R line was all dashes. So changing the first character of R to O. The rest can stay as per the user's request, only adding at the beginning.

Let me double-check the notation rules. For Toms, O is a hard hit. For Ride, O is a hard bell hit. That's correct. The user didn't specify soft, so default to hard.

Therefore, the edited groove should have the Toms line starting with O--- and Ride starting with O---. The rest remains the same. Let me put that into the final answer.
