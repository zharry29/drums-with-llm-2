Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to have not only snare but also ride. Looking at the given groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

First, the snare is only on the third and fourth beats of the third and fourth bars. The ride is completely silent. The edit request is to add ride, so I need to incorporate the ride cymbal into the groove without removing the snare. 

The user probably wants the ride to complement the existing snare parts. Since the original has toms playing a steady pattern (O-o- repeated), maybe adding a ride pattern that fits with the kick and snare. Let's see where the snare hits are: in the third beat of the third measure and the first beat of the fourth measure. 

To add ride, I can start with a basic ride pattern. Common ride patterns include steady eighth notes or a swing feel. Since the existing kick and toms have a steady quarter notes (O---|O--- etc.), maybe a steady eighth note ride on the bow (X and x). Let's try alternating between X and x for a consistent rhythm. 

Let me check each bar:

First bar: K is O---, no snare. So ride could be steady eighths here. Let's do X-X- for the first beat, but wait each bar is four beats, each with four 16th notes. So each | is a beat. The ride line has four characters per beat. So for a steady eighth note (every two 16th notes), maybe X-x- repeated. Wait, each beat is four 16th notes, so an eighth note would be every two. So for a steady eighth note ride on the bow, it would be X-x- for each beat. So per bar, it would be X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-. But maybe alternate hard and soft for variation. Like X-x- for each beat. 

Alternatively, maybe start with X on the first 16th of each beat and x on the third, creating a X-x- pattern per beat. That would make the ride line: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x- for each bar. 

Let me test that. So adding R: X-X-|X-X- etc. Wait, need to make sure it's four characters per beat. So each beat's four 16th notes: for the first beat of first bar, X on first 16th, then -, then x on third, then -. So X-x- per beat. Repeating that across all four bars. 

So the ride line would be:

R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

But maybe the user wants more syncopation. Alternatively, since the snare is only in the third and fourth bars, maybe emphasize those with ride hits. But the instruction is to add ride, not necessarily sync with snare. 

Alternatively, use a swing pattern with X-X- on each beat. Let me go with X-X- for each beat to keep it simple and steady. Wait, but X-X- would be two hits per beat, which is eighth notes. 

Wait, let me clarify: Each beat has four 16th notes. So for a steady eighth note ride, you hit on the first and third 16th of each beat. So for each beat: X - x - (but using X and x alternately). So X-x- for each beat. 

Therefore, the R line would be:

R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

This adds a consistent ride pattern that complements the kick and toms. The snare remains as is. 

Let me check for conflicts. The kick is O---|O--- etc., so the first 16th of each beat has a kick. The ride's X is also on the first 16th. That's okay, they can coincide. The toms are O-o- on each beat, so first 16th is O, third is o. The ride's x on third 16th is a soft closed hit, which should work. 

Alternatively, maybe use X on the first and third 16th for harder hits, but the pattern as X-x- seems okay. 

So the final edit would be adding the ride line as X-x- across all bars. Let me write that out:

R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

Wait, but in the notation, each beat is separated by |. So the full R line would be:

R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

Yes. That should fulfill the request of adding ride while keeping the snare parts. 

Alternatively, maybe vary it a bit, but the user's instruction is straightforward. Just ensure that ride is added where it wasn't before. So the edited groove should have the R line filled with a consistent pattern. 

I think that's the way to go. So the final answer would be replacing the R line with the above.
