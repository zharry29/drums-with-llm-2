Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any cymbals and the kick drum. Let me first recall the instruments involved here. The given groove has lines for Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R). The user specified "no cymbal or kick," so I need to zero out the Kick (K) and any cymbals, which are Crash (C) and Ride (R). 

Looking at the original groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

First, the Kick line (K) has some hits, so I'll replace all its characters with '-' to silence it. 

Next, check for cymbals. Here, Crash (C) and Ride (R) are both empty except for maybe in other examples, but in this case, they're already all dashes. Wait, the user might have meant any cymbals, so even if they were present, but here they aren't. So that's already okay. 

The Hihat (H) is active with X and X, which are closed hits according to the notation. Since the user didn't mention hihat, it stays. The Snare (S) has O's on beats 2 and 4, which is fine. Toms (T) are silent, so that's okay too.

So the main changes are:

- Set all K entries to '-'.
- Ensure C and R are '-' (they already are here).

Let me verify each line:

Original K line: O---|----|O---|---- becomes all dashes: ----|----|----|----
S remains as is: ----|O---|----|O---
H stays: X---|X---|X---|X---
T, C, R remain as all dashes.

Wait, but the user's instruction says "no cymbal or kick." Since Ride and Crash are cymbals, even if they weren't playing, we need to make sure they're off. But in the given groove, they already have all dashes, so no change there. The Kick is the main thing to clear.

So the edited groove should have K line all dashes, and confirm others are okay. The user didn't mention hihat or snare or toms, so those stay as they are. Let me double-check the notation rules to ensure that I'm not missing any cymbals in other lines. For example, the Hihat's X is a closed hit, which is part of the hihat, not a cymbal. The user only wanted to remove cymbals (crash, ride) and kick. So this should be correct.
