Okay, let's see. The user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing any ride or kick elements. First, I need to understand the original groove provided. 

Looking at the given drum notation:

Kick (K): -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
Snare (S): ----|----|S---|----
Hihat (H): x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
Toms (T): ----|----|---O|----
Crash (C): O---|O---|O---|O---
Ride (R): ----|----|----|----

The user's request is to remove "ride or kick". So I need to set the Kick (K) and Ride (R) lines to all '-' since they shouldn't be present anymore. 

Let me check each line:

- **K line**: All characters should become '-', so the entire K line becomes "----|----|----|----".
- **R line**: It's already all '-', so no change there, but just to confirm, yes, it stays empty.
- The other instruments (S, H, T, C) stay as they are unless they involve ride or kick, but since the user only mentioned those two, the rest can remain.

Wait, but the Crash (C) has "O---" in each beat. The user didn't mention crashes, so those stay. The snare and hihat are fine. Toms have a hit in the third beat, which is okay.

So the edited version would have K and R lines cleared. Let me write that out:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

I should double-check to ensure I didn't miss any kick or ride hits. The original K had some Os and o's, now all replaced. Ride was already empty, so that's correct. The user didn't mention toms or crashes, so they stay. Looks good.
