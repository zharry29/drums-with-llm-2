Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a tom hit and a snare in the very beginning. The original groove has no kick, snare, toms, or crashes, just hihats and ride. 

First, I need to add a tom hit and a snare on the first 16th note. Since the user specified "very beginning," that's the first character of the first beat (the first 'O' in the K line and S line). 

Looking at the Toms line (T:), it's all dashes. I'll add an 'O' there for a hard hit. For the snare, the S line is all dashes, so adding an 'O' there as well. 

But wait, the original R (ride) has some hits. The user didn't mention removing ride, so leave that as is. Also, check if any other instruments need adjustment. The hihats are closed (X-x-), so maybe keep those. 

Let me draft it out:

Original K: ----|----|----|----
Add a tom hit: T: O---|----|----|----

Original S: ----|----|----|----
Add snare hit: S: O---|----|----|----

Check the rest remain the same. Make sure the first beat's first note has both T and S hits. That should fulfill the request without altering other parts unless needed. Let me verify the notation rules again to ensure O is correct for both instruments. Yep, O is a hard hit for toms and snare. 

Looks good. Final check for any typos. All set.
