Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. They said they don't want any snare or hihat. Let me look at the original groove first.

The original is:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Alright, the user wants to remove the snare (S) and hihat (H). That means I need to set all the S and H lines to all dashes. Let me double-check each line.

First, the Kick (K) line is okay since it's not being removed. The Snare (S) line has some hits, so I'll replace each character with '-'. Same with the Hihat (H) line, which has X and x characters; those all become '-'.

The Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R) lines are already empty except for some dashes, so they stay as they are unless there's something there. Let me confirm each line:

- K remains the same.
- S becomes all '-'.
- H becomes all '-'.
- T, C, R stay as they are (already empty).

Wait, let me check the original again. The Toms (T) line is all dashes, so that's fine. Crash and Ride are also empty. So the edited version should have S and H lines cleared.

Let me write that out:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Hmm, yes, that should do it. I need to make sure there are no remaining characters in S and H. Let me count the characters for each line. Each line should have 16 characters (including the | separators). Let's check the S line:

Original S: "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o" becomes "----|----|----|----". Each beat (four characters) separated by |. Each segment after | should be four characters. So each part like "----" is four '-', so that's correct.

Same with H: "X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-" becomes "----|----|----|----". All dashes now. Perfect.

So the final edited groove should look like this with all S and H lines cleared. I think that's all. No other instruments are involved here except the ones the user wanted removed. The Kick is still there, and the others are empty. Yep, looks good.
