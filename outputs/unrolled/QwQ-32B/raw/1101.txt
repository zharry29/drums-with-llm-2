Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants more low-frequency sounds in their drum groove. Looking at the given groove:

**Original Groove:**
```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-  
S: ----|----|S---|----  
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-  
T: ----|----|---O|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----
```

First, I need to identify which instruments contribute to low frequencies. The kick drum (K) and toms (T) are the main low-frequency elements. The crash cymbal (C) is higher, so reducing that might help. The snare (S) and hihat/ride (H, R) are mid/high.

The current kick has some hits but maybe not enough. The toms only have one hit in the third beat. The crashes are on every beat, which might be overpowering the lows.

**Steps to increase low frequencies:**
1. **Boost the Kick (K):** Add more kick hits where possible. The original has some gaps. For example, the first beat starts with a rest, maybe add a kick there.
2. **Add Toms (T):** The toms are only on the third beat. Adding more tom hits in other beats can fill in the low end.
3. **Reduce Highs:** Remove or reduce crashes (C) to let the lows stand out more.
4. **Check Snare (S):** The snare is only on the third beat. Maybe keep it as is but ensure it doesn't clash with lows.

**Modifications:**
- **Kick (K):** Convert some rests to kicks. For example, first beat’s first note could be O. Also, in the fourth beat, maybe add more kicks.
- **Toms (T):** Add tom hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 to complement the kick.
- **Crashes (C):** Remove all crashes to eliminate high frequencies.
- **Snare (S):** Keep as is but ensure it’s not too dominant.

**Testing the Changes:**
Let me try adjusting each part step by step.

**Kick Adjustment:**
Original K: `-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-`
Adding kicks where possible:
- First beat: `-O--` → `OOO-` (but need to check rhythm)
Wait, maybe spread them out. Let's see:
Maybe `O---|OOO-|---O|OOO-` but need to fit the rhythm.

Alternatively, keep the original pattern but fill in some rests:
First beat starts with `-O--` → maybe `O-O-` (so first and third 16th notes)
Second beat `OO--` stays or add more?
Hmm, maybe make the kick more consistent.

Alternatively, to make it more steady, perhaps a constant eighth notes? But the original has some syncopation.

Alternatively, in the first bar, first beat `-O--` becomes `O-O-` (so on 1 and 3 of the 16th notes), but maybe better to have more O's.

Alternatively, let's try:

K: `O-O-|OOO-|O-O-|OOO-` (but need to ensure it's 4 characters per beat)

Wait, each beat is 4 characters. So for each beat separated by |, like first beat is `-O--` (original). Let me rework each beat:

Original K:
Beat 1: `-O--` → maybe `O-O-` (so first and third 16th notes hit)
Beat 2: `OO--` → maybe `OOO-` (three hits)
Beat 3: `---O` → maybe `O--O` or keep as is but add a hit?
Beat 4: `-OO-` → `OOO-` or similar.

But need to make sure it's 4 characters per beat.

Alternatively, to maximize low end, perhaps make the kick hit on every 16th note where possible. But that might be too much.

Alternatively, focus on the main beats. Let me try:

K: `O---|OOO-|O-O-|OOO-` → but need to check each beat's 4 characters.

Wait, let me reconstruct beat by beat:

First beat (original `-O--`):
Maybe `O-O-` (so first and third 16th notes).

Second beat (original `OO--`):
`OOO-` (three hits).

Third beat (original `---O`):
Maybe `O--O` (first and fourth).

Fourth beat (original `-OO-`):
`OOO-` (first three).

So overall K becomes:
`O-O-|OOO-|O--O|OOO-`

But need to check if that's balanced. Alternatively, maybe more consistent.

Alternatively, for simplicity, make the kick hit on every downbeat (every 4th note) but with more fills.

Alternatively, let's go with:

K: `O---|OOO-|O-O-|OOO-` → but need to ensure each beat is 4 chars. Wait, each beat is 4 characters. So for beat 1: "O---", beat 2 "OOO-", etc.

Wait, the user's original K line is "-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-". Each beat is 4 characters. So modifying each beat:

Beat1: -O-- → O-O- (so hits on first and third 16th notes)
Beat2: OO-- → OOO- (three hits)
Beat3: ---O → O--O (first and fourth)
Beat4: -OO- → OOO- (first three)

Thus K becomes:
`O-O-|OOO-|O--O|OOO-`

But maybe better to have more consistency. Alternatively, let's see:

Alternatively, to make it more solid, maybe the kick is on every beat's first 16th note and some others.

Alternatively, let me think of the kick as playing on every quarter note (since 4 beats in the bar, each beat is 4 16ths). So the first 16th of each beat would have a kick, plus some extra hits.

Alternatively, maybe make the kick play on every eighth note. Since each beat is 4 16ths, an eighth is two 16ths. So for each beat, hit kick on first and third 16th (eighth notes):

So for each beat, `O-O-` → so the kick plays every eighth note.

Thus:

K: `O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O-` → but that's very steady. But maybe the user's original has more variation. Hmm.

Alternatively, combine both approaches. Let's try:

K: O-O-|OOO-|O-O-|OOO- 

Now for Toms (T):

Original T has only in third beat: `---O`. Let's add toms in other beats.

For example:

Beat1: O---
Beat2: O---
Beat3: ---O (original)
Beat4: O---

So T: `O---|O---|---O|O---`

This way, toms are on the first 16th of beats 1,2,4 and the fourth of beat3.

Combined with kick, this adds more low end.

Crashes (C) are on every beat, which are high. So removing them:

C: `----|----|----|----`

Snare (S) is only on third beat's third 16th (since S: `S---` in third beat). Keep that.

Hihat (H) remains as it is, since it's closed hits (x) which are mid but not too high, and the user didn't mention removing it.

Putting it all together:

**Edited Groove:**
```
K: O-O-|OOO-|O-O-|OOO-  
S: ----|----|S---|----  
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-  
T: O---|O---|---O|O---  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Wait, but need to check if each line has exactly 16 characters (4 beats of 4 each). Let's verify:

K: Each beat is 4 chars. O-O- (4), OOO- (4), O-O- (4), OOO- (4) → total 16. Good.

T: Each beat 4 chars. O---, O---, ---O, O--- → total 16. Good.

C: All dashes → 16. Good.

S: Each beat has 4, so yes.

Yes, this should work. This adds more kick and tom hits, removes crashes, focusing on low frequencies.
