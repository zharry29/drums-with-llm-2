Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the hihat and kick parts from the given groove. 

First, I'll look at the original groove provided:

K: O---|----|O---|---- (Kick drum has hits on the first and third beats)
S: ----|O---|----|O--- (Snare on the second and fourth beats)
H: X---|X---|X---|X--- (Hihat is closed on every beat)
T: ----|----|----|---- (No toms)
C: ----|----|----|---- (No crash)
R: ----|----|----|---- (No ride)

The user's request is to eliminate both the hihat (H line) and kick (K line). So I need to clear those lines completely. 

Starting with the Kick (K line): Change all non '-' characters to '-'. The original K line has 'O' on the first and third 16th notes of their respective beats. Setting those to '-' will silence the kick.

Next, the Hihat (H line) has 'X' on every beat. Changing each 'X' to '-' will remove all hihat sounds.

The other lines (Snare, Toms, Crash, Ride) should remain as they are unless they were also part of the request, but the user only mentioned hihat and kick. 

Let me double-check the user's instruction again: "I don't want any hihat or kick." So only K and H lines need modification. 

Now, constructing the new groove:

- K line becomes all dashes: K: ----|----|----|----
- H line becomes all dashes: H: ----|----|----|----
- The rest remain unchanged.

Wait, looking at the original R line, it's all dashes. The snare is present as per S line. So the final edited groove should have K and H lines cleared. Let me ensure no other instruments are affected. 

Yes, that's correct. The result should have the kick and hihat silenced, leaving snare alone with no other percussion. 

Let me write that out properly in the notation format.
