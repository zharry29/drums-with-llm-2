Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the kick on beat 4, but everything else should stay the same. Let me first look at the provided groove.

Looking at the original groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

So, the kick (K line) is already all dashes, meaning there's no kick in any beat. The user's request is to remove the kick on beat 4, but since there's no kick present anywhere, including beat 4, there's actually nothing to change here. The existing groove already meets the requirement. 

Wait, maybe I should double-check. The user might have thought there was a kick on beat 4, but in the given groove, the K line is all dashes. Therefore, the correct response is to just present the same groove as there's no change needed. 

Alternatively, perhaps there was a typo in the problem statement, but based on the provided data, no edits are necessary. I'll confirm each line again to be sure. 

Snare (S) and other instruments are as given. Since the kick is already silent everywhere, the final answer remains unchanged.
