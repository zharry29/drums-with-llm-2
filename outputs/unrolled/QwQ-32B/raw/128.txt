Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to have not only tom but also ride. Looking at the given groove:

First, check the current instruments. The Kick (K) has some hits, Snare (S) on beats 2 and 4, Hihat (H) is all X's, and Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R) are all empty. The edit request says to add tom and ride. Wait, the original request says "not only tom but also ride," which might mean that currently, there's only tom, but in the given groove, Toms are empty. Maybe the user meant adding both?

Wait, let me re-read. The user's edit request says "The groove should have not only tom but also ride." Hmm, perhaps the original groove had only toms and needed ride added, but in the provided example, Toms are empty. Maybe it's a translation issue. Alternatively, maybe "not only tom but also ride" means they want both toms and ride added where they weren't present before.

Looking at the given groove: Toms line is all dashes, so no tom hits. Ride is also all dashes. So the user wants to add both tom and ride parts.

So the task is to add tom hits and ride hits to the existing groove. Let me start by adding some tom patterns. Since the kick and snare are on strong beats, maybe place toms on offbeats. For example, on the "&" of each beat. Let's see:

For Toms (T), maybe start with O on the "&" of each beat. Let's try:

T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O-- (each beat has an O on the second 16th note)

Alternatively, maybe vary it. Let's see the kick pattern: K is O on first beat of first and third measures, and the snare is on 2 and 4. To complement, maybe toms on the "&" of 1 and 3, and maybe some other spots.

Alternatively, toms could be on the third 16th note of each beat. Let me pick a simple pattern first.

Then for Ride (R), since the current Hihat is all X (closed hits), maybe the ride can play a steady pattern. The user's previous examples often use X and x for ride. Maybe a steady eighth notes or 16th notes. Since the hihat is already doing closed hits, maybe the ride adds some variation. Let's try a simple pattern like X on each beat and x on the "&". For example:

R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

But let me check the existing hihat. Hihat is X--- for each beat? Wait, the given H line is X---|X---|X---|X---, which is X on the first 16th note of each beat. So maybe the ride can play on the "&" and the "+" (third and fourth 16th notes). Let me think.

Alternatively, a common ride pattern is quarter notes on the bell, so O on each beat. But maybe to add some movement, use X and x for closed hits. Let me go with X on the first 16th of each beat and x on the third. So R: X-x- repeated each beat. That would give a steady eighth-note feel with some variation.

Putting it all together:

Toms: Let's add O on the "&" of each beat (second 16th note). So each beat would be -O--, so T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--

Ride: Let's do X on the first 16th and x on the third: X-x- for each beat. So R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

Check if this doesn't conflict with existing parts. The kick is O on first 16th of first and third beats, so the tom's O on "&" won't clash. The snare is on 2 and 4, so that's okay. The hihat is on the first 16th, so ride's X on first is okay, but maybe overlapping? The hihat and ride can coexist on the same note, as they're different instruments.

Alternatively, maybe offset the ride. Let me confirm the user's previous edits. In a prior example, when adding ride, they used X on the second 16th. Wait in the user's previous answer for a similar request, when adding ride to a groove with hihat, they sometimes used X on the second 16th. Let me check.

Looking back, in an earlier example where the user added ride to a groove with hihat, they had:

Original H: x-x- etc., and added R: X-x- etc. So maybe similar approach here.

Alternatively, maybe the ride should be on the offbeats. Let me proceed with the Toms as -O-- and Ride as X-x-.

So the edited groove would be:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--
C: ----|----|----|----
R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

This adds both toms and ride as requested. Let me double-check the counts. Each line has 16 characters (4 beats *4). Toms have an O every second 16th note, creating a steady pattern. Ride has X on first and x on third, giving a rhythmic feel. This should fulfill the edit request.
