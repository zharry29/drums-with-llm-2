Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a drum pattern and wants to remove any kick (K) or hihat (H) parts. Let me first parse the original groove to understand what needs to be changed.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

The user's request is to eliminate kick and hihat. So I need to set all K and H lines to all '-' characters. Let me check each line:

- **Kick (K):** The current pattern has some hits like O--O in the first beat. Removing these means replacing every non '-' in K's line with '-'.
- **Hihat (H):** Already all '-', so no change there, but to be thorough, ensure it's clear.
- The other instruments (S, T, C, R) should stay as they are unless they conflict, but the user only mentioned removing kick and hihat.

Wait, the S (snare) and R (ride) have patterns. Since the user didn't mention those, leave them. Let me reconstruct each line:

For K line: Replace everything with '----|----|----|----'

H line remains '----|----|----|----'

Check the other lines:

S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o → stays

T: all '-' → stays

C: all '-' → stays

R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O- → stays

So the edited groove should have K and H lines cleared. Let me write that out properly, ensuring the structure with | between beats and 16 characters total.

Double-checking each line's length. Each line should have four beats (four groups of four characters separated by |), totaling 16 characters. For example, K's line becomes four groups of '----', so "----|----|----|----".

Yes, that's correct. The rest of the lines remain unchanged. That should fulfill the user's request.
