Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the ride and tom parts from the given groove. 

First, I need to look at the original drum groove provided:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, actually looking at the user's input, the T line (Toms) is already all dashes, so there's no tom to remove. The ride (R) is also all dashes. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's given groove:

Looking at the user's input:

The T line is all dashes, so no toms are played. The R line is also all dashes. So maybe there's a mistake here. But the user's edit request says "I don't want any ride or tom." Since both are already not present, the edited version would be the same as the original? But that can't be right. Maybe I need to check again.

Wait, perhaps I misread the original. Let me parse each line again carefully.

Original groove lines:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So, Toms (T) are all dashes, so no tom hits. Ride (R) is also all dashes. So removing ride and tom won't change anything. But maybe the crash (C) is present. Wait, the user didn't mention crash. The user only wants to remove ride and tom. Since those are already not there, the edited groove is same as original except maybe the crash? But the user didn't ask to remove crash. So the answer should be same as original. But perhaps the user made a mistake, but I should follow the instructions. Alternatively, maybe I misread the original. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the user's input again:

The given groove's R line is all dashes, so no ride. The T line is also dashes, so no toms. So the edit request doesn't require any changes. But that's strange. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the input. Let me check again the user's provided groove:

Yes, so T and R are already empty. Therefore, the edited version remains the same except maybe the user wants to ensure those lines are cleared. But since they are already cleared, the output is the same as input. However, perhaps the user intended to have some ride or toms, but in the given example, they are not present. Therefore, the correct edited version is exactly the same as the original, except perhaps the user wants to remove the crash as well? But the request was only ride and tom. So the answer should be the same as the original. But maybe the user made a mistake in the input, but I have to proceed with what's given. So the final answer is the same as the original.
