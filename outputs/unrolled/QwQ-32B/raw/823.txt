Okay, so the user wants me to edit a drum groove by adding a ride hit and hihat in the very beginning. Let me look at the given groove first.

The original drum groove is:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Hmm, the user's request is to add a ride hit and hihat at the very start. The "very beginning" would be the first 16th note of the first beat, right? Let me check each line.

First, the Kick (K) starts with an O on the first note of the first beat. The Snare (S) has nothing in the first beat. The Hihat (H) is all dashes in the first beat, so that's where we need to add the hihat hit. The Ride (R) is all dashes in the first beat as well. 

So, for the first note (the first 16th note of the first beat), I need to add a hihat hit and a ride hit. 

For the hihat, the default in the example notation uses 'x' for closed hits. Since the user didn't specify open or closed, but the existing Hihat line is empty, maybe starting with a closed hit (x) makes sense. 

For the ride, the user wants a hit on the bell, so 'O' would be a hard hit on the bell. Alternatively, maybe 'o' for a softer one, but since they said "hit" without specifying, 'O' is safer.

So modifying the first note of the H and R lines:

Original H line: ----|....
Change first character to 'x', making it x---|....

Original R line: ----|....
Change first character to 'O', making it O---|....

Let me check if that's all. The rest of the first beat's notes can stay as they are unless the user wants more, but the request was specifically for the very beginning (first hit). 

Wait, the user might mean the first beat in general? But "very beginning" likely refers to the first note. Let me confirm the notation: each | separates beats, so first four characters are the first beat. The first character is the first 16th note.

So changing only the first character of H and R. Let me also ensure that adding these doesn't conflict with existing hits. The Kick has an O there, so having a hihat and ride along with kick is okay. 

So the edited lines would be:

H: x---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

That should fulfill the request. Let me double-check the rules for articulation. Hihat's X and x are closed hits (hard and soft). Since we used x, that's a soft closed hit. Ride's O is a hard open hit on the bell. That's correct. 

I think that's all. The rest of the groove remains the same. Let me present the final version.
