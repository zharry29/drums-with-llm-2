Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to include not only the kick drum but also the tom. Looking at the given groove:

First, let's parse the current setup. The Kick (K) has some hits, but the Toms (T) are all dashes, meaning they're not being used. The edit request is straightforward: add tom hits where they make sense without conflicting with existing parts.

Looking at each part:

**Kick (K):** 
- Bar 1: O--- (hard hit on the first 16th note)
- Bar 2: ---o (soft hit on the fourth 16th note)
- Bar 3: O-O- (hard on first, rest, hard on third)
- Bar 4: ---- (no hits)

**Snare (S):**
- Bar 2 and 4 have O---, so likely snare hits on the first 16th of those bars. 

**Hihat (H):** 
- Some open and closed hits, but not crucial for the edit.

**Crash (C):** 
- Crash on the first beat of the first bar.

The user wants to add toms. Since the current groove has no toms, I need to decide where to place them. Common places for toms might be off-beats or complementing the kick. Let's look at each bar:

**Bar 1:**
- K hits on the first 16th. Maybe a tom on the third or fourth 16th to add depth. Let's try a soft tom (o) on the fourth 16th to not clash with the crash.

**Bar 2:**
- K hits on the fourth 16th. A tom could go on the first or second. Since snare is on the first, maybe a tom on the second 16th (soft o) to avoid clashing.

**Bar 3:**
- K hits on 1 and 3. Adding a tom on the fourth 16th here could work, maybe a hard O for emphasis.

**Bar 4:**
- No kick, so perhaps a tom on the first 16th to lead into the next bar, maybe a soft o to keep it subtle.

Now, ensuring that the toms don't clash with other instruments. Let me draft:

T: ---o | -o-- | ---O | o---

Breaking it down:
- Bar1: ---o (tom on 4th 16th)
- Bar2: -o-- (tom on 2nd 16th)
- Bar3: ---O (tom on 4th 16th, hard hit)
- Bar4: o--- (tom on 1st 16th, soft)

This should add toms in a way that complements the existing kick without overlapping too much. Let me check again:

- Bar1: Kick on 1, tom on 4. The crash is on the first beat, so tom on 4 is okay.
- Bar2: Snare on 1, kick on 4, tom on 2. That should work.
- Bar3: Kicks on 1 and 3, tom on 4. Good.
- Bar4: Tom on 1, since there's no kick here, it sets up the next bar.

This seems balanced. I'll put this into the notation.
