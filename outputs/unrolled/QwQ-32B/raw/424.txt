Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. The user said, "I don't want any tom or kick." Let me start by understanding what each line represents in the given drum notation.

First, looking at the provided drum groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Each line corresponds to a different drum part. The user wants to remove the kick (K) and toms (T). Let me check each line:

- **K (Kick drum):** The line has some hits like O--O and --O-. Since the user doesn't want any kick, I need to replace all those characters with '-' to silence them.
- **S (Snare drum):** This has some notes, but the user didn't mention snare, so leave it as is.
- **H (Hihat):** The user didn't mention hihat, so leave it too.
- **T (Toms):** Already all '-' so no change needed here, but just confirm.
- **C (Crash cymbal) and R (Ride cymbal):** Also not mentioned, so leave them unless specified.

Wait, the user said "tom or kick". Toms are already silent, so only K needs to be cleared. Let me double-check the T line to be sure. Yes, T is all dashes, so no action there. The main task is to set K's line to all '-'.

So the edited version should have K's line as all dashes. Let me reconstruct the K line:

Original K: O--O|----|--O-|----
After editing: ----|----|----|----

Other lines remain the same except ensuring T stays silent. Let me verify each part again to avoid mistakes. The user didn't mention hihat, snare, crash, or ride, so those stay. The final result should look like this:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I think that's it. Just making sure there are no typos. The kick line is now all dashes, and toms were already silent. The rest remains as per the original except where specified.
