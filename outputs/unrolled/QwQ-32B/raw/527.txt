Okay, let's see. The user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing any parts involving toms (T) and hihats (H). The original groove is provided, and I need to make sure those instruments are cleared out.

First, I'll look at the given drum notation. The user's request is straightforward: no tom or hihat. So, I need to check each line of the drum groove. 

Starting with the K (Kick drum) line: "-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-". Since kick isn't being removed, I'll leave this as is. 

Next, the S (Snare drum) line: "----|----|S---|----". Snare is okay, so no changes here either. 

Now, the H (Hihat) line: "x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-". The user wants no hihat, so I'll replace all characters in this line with '-' to indicate no hits. 

Then, the T (Toms) line: "----|----|---O|----". Toms need to be removed, so this entire line becomes all '-'.

The C (Crash cymbal) line has "O---|O---|O---|O---". Since the user didn't mention crash, but they did say no cymbals? Wait, the request was "no tom or hihat". Wait, the user's exact words were "I don't want any tom or hihat." So crash and ride are allowed unless specified. Wait, the user might have meant only toms and hihats, so crash is okay. Wait, but in some previous examples, when the user said "no cymbal or tom", that included crash and ride. Let me check the user's history to be sure. 

Looking back at previous interactions, when the user said "I don't want any cymbal or tom", the assistant removed both crash (C) and ride (R). But in this case, the request is "no tom or hihat", so crash and ride are okay unless specified. Wait, but in the current problem, the user says "no tom or hihat", so only T and H lines should be cleared. The crash (C) is a cymbal but not mentioned, so it stays. 

Wait, the user's instruction here says "I don't want any tom or hihat." So only T and H need to be removed. So the C (crash) remains. So the C line stays as "O---|O---|O---|O---".

The R (Ride cymbal) line is "----|----|----|----", which is already empty, so no change.

So putting it all together, the edited groove should have H and T lines all '-'.

Let me double-check each line:

- K remains: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
- S remains: ----|----|S---|----
- H becomes: ----|----|----|----
- T becomes: ----|----|----|----
- C stays: O---|O---|O---|O---
- R stays: ----|----|----|----

Yes, that should be correct. I need to ensure that in the final output, only the specified instruments are removed and the rest are unchanged.
