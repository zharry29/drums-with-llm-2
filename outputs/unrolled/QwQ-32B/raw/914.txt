Okay, let me tackle this edit request. The user wants me to "drop out everything in the second beat" of the given drum groove. First, I need to understand what the original groove looks like and where the second beat is located.

Looking at the provided drum notation:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Each line represents a different drum component, and each set of four characters separated by | is a beat. The bar has four beats total. The second beat is the part after the first |, so for each instrument, I need to set all characters in the second beat to '-' (no hit).

Starting with the Kick (K):
Original second beat: ---o
After dropping: ----

Snare (S):
Original second beat: O---
After dropping: ----

Hihat (H):
Original second beat: O-o-
After dropping: ----

Toms (T) and Crash (C) already have nothing in the second beat, so they stay the same. Ride (R) also has nothing there.

Now, I need to reconstruct each line by replacing the second beat's characters with '-'. Let's go step by step:

For K:
Original: O---|---o|O-O-|----
After edit: O---|----|O-O-|----

For S:
Original: ----|O---|----|O---
After edit: ----|----|----|O---

For H:
Original: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
After edit: --o-|----|O-o-|O-o-

T, C, and R remain unchanged except for the second beat being cleared.

Wait, let me check the Hihat again. The third beat in H is O-o-, which should stay. The second beat O-o- becomes ----.

Putting it all together:

K: O---|----|O-O-|----
S: ----|----|----|O---
H: --o-|----|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I need to ensure that only the second beat of each line is cleared. Let me double-check each instrument's second beat:

- Kick's second beat is now all dashes.
- Snare's second beat is cleared.
- Hihat's second beat is cleared.
- Toms and Crash were already empty there, so no change.
- Ride also had nothing, so stays.

Yes, this should meet the user's request. Now, format it properly within the @@@ tags.
