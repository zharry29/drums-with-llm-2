Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the cymbal on beat 4 but keep everything else the same. First, I need to check the original groove provided.

Looking at the given drum notation:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

The user mentioned "cymbal on beat 4". Since the cymbals here are represented by the 'C' (Crash) and 'R' (Ride) lines, I need to check both. 

Looking at the 'R' line (Ride cymbal), each beat is "o-O-". The fourth beat is "o-O-", so the last part of the fourth beat (the fourth 16th note) has an 'o' which is a soft hit on the ride bell. Since the user wants to remove cymbals on beat 4, I need to set all characters in the fourth beat of the Ride line to '-'.

The 'C' line (Crash) is all dashes, so no crash cymbal is being used here. Therefore, only the Ride cymbal needs adjustment.

So, modifying the 'R' line's fourth beat from "o-O-" to "----". The rest of the lines remain unchanged. Let me double-check to ensure I didn't affect other beats. The first three beats of 'R' stay as "o-O-", only the fourth beat is cleared. That should meet the user's request without altering anything else.
