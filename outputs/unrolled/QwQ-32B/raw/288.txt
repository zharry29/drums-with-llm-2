Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to have not only hihat but also ride. Looking at the given groove:

The Kick (K) has hits on the first and third beats. The Snare (S) is on beats 2 and 4. The Hihat (H) is consistently closed (X) on every 16th note, which is good. The Ride (R) is all dashes, meaning it's not playing. 

The edit request is to add ride, so I need to incorporate the ride cymbal without removing the hihat. Since the hihat is already active, the ride can complement it. Typically, ride patterns might play on the beats or off-beats. 

Looking at the existing structure, the snare is on 2 and 4. Maybe the ride can play on the quarter notes (every beat) to provide a steady pulse. Since the hihat is closed, using the ride's closed hits (X/x) on the bow could work. 

Let me think of a simple ride pattern. Maybe a steady eighth notes? That would be every two 16th notes. For example, X on each quarter note and x on the off-beats. Let's see:

For each beat (four 16th notes), a common ride pattern could be X-x- (hard on the first 16th, soft on the third). Repeating this for each beat would give X-x-|X-x-| etc. But need to check the existing instruments. 

Alternatively, maybe a more active pattern. Since the user's previous edits often used -X-X for ride, maybe alternating hard and soft. Let me check previous examples. In prior answers, when adding ride, they often used -X-X or similar. 

Wait, in the user's previous edits, for example, when adding ride to a groove without it, they often put something like -X-X|-X-X etc. For instance, in the first example the user provided, when adding ride, they used X-X- or -X-X patterns. Let me confirm.

Looking at one of the previous responses where the user added ride to a similar groove:

They had K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X

So the ride was -X-X repeating. So maybe following that pattern here. Let me apply that here.

Original given groove's R line is all dashes. To add ride, using a pattern like -X-X for each beat. So each beat is four 16th notes. Let's break it down:

First beat: |---- for R becomes |-X-X. Wait, no, the first beat would be the first four characters. Let me structure it correctly.

The R line needs to have 16 characters separated by | every four. So for four beats:

If the pattern is -X-X for each beat, then each beat's four notes would be - X X - ?

Wait, maybe I need to think of it as a repeating pattern every beat. Let me see.

Suppose the ride plays a quarter note (every beat) with a hard hit on the first 16th and soft on the third, like X-x- for each beat. That would be X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-.

Alternatively, maybe a more active pattern like X-X- or -X-X. Since the user's previous edits used -X-X, perhaps that's the way to go.

Let me try the pattern -X-X for each beat. So each beat's four 16th notes would be - X X - ?

Wait, no. Let me think of each beat as four 16th notes. Let's take the first beat:

Original R line is "----|----|----|----"

To add a ride pattern like -X-X on each beat:

First beat: -X-X

Second beat: -X-X

Third: same, and fourth same. So the full R line would be:

-X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X

That way, every other 16th note has a ride hit, alternating between soft and hard? Wait, according to the notation, X is hard and x is soft on the bow for ride. So "-X-X" would be: first 16th note: no hit, second: hard X, third: no hit, fourth: soft x? Wait, no, the characters are each 16th note.

Wait, the pattern "-X-X" would be:

First 16th note: -, no hit.

Second 16th: X (hard on bow)

Third: -, no hit.

Fourth: X again? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me clarify.

The user's previous example had R: -X-X|-X-X etc. So each beat is four characters. For example, the first beat of R in that example is -X-X, meaning:

1st 16th: no hit,

2nd: hard X,

3rd: no hit,

4th: hard X again?

Wait, but that might be too much. Alternatively, perhaps the pattern is alternating between soft and hard. Let me check the ride's articulation again.

Ride (R): O is hard bell, o soft bell; X/x are hard/soft closed on bow. So using X and x can create a rhythm on the bow.

In the example I mentioned earlier, the user used "-X-X" for each beat in the R line. Let me see how that sounds. For each beat, the ride plays on the second and fourth 16th notes with hard and hard again? Or maybe it's X and x. Wait, in the previous example, the R line was "-X-X|-X-X etc. So each beat is - X - X. So the second and fourth 16th notes have hits, alternating between hard and... Wait, maybe it's X and X again. Hmm, perhaps it's a specific pattern the user prefers.

Alternatively, to complement the hihat's steady closed hits (X on every 16th), the ride could play on the beats. For example, on each quarter note (first 16th of each beat), a hard hit on the bell (O), but that might clash with the hihat. Alternatively, using the bow for a smoother sound.

Alternatively, a common ride pattern is to hit on the first and third 16th notes of each beat, but that might be too busy. Alternatively, every other 16th note.

Wait, maybe the simplest way is to mirror the hihat's pattern but on the ride, but that might not be necessary. Since the hihat is already active, the ride can add a complementary pattern. Let's try a basic ride pattern where the ride plays on the first and third 16th notes of each beat, using X (hard) and x (soft). For example, X-x- for each beat, resulting in X-x-|X-x- etc. That way, it's every beat's first and third 16th notes, creating an eighth note feel.

Alternatively, the user's previous edits used "-X-X" which would be on the second and fourth 16th notes. Let me check an example again. In one of the previous answers, when adding ride to a groove without it, the ride was set to -X-X for each beat. Let me confirm that example:

In the user's first example, the original had no ride, and after editing, R was -X-X repeated. So following that pattern, I'll apply the same here.

So for each beat in the R line, we'll have "-X-X", making the full R line:

-X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X

This way, every other 16th note in each beat has a ride hit, starting with the second 16th. That should add the ride without conflicting too much with the hihat's every 16th note hits. The hihat is closed (X) on every 16th, and the ride plays on the second and fourth 16ths, which are the offbeats. This should create a nice interplay between the two.

Therefore, the edited groove would have the R line as above. Let me check the original given groove again to ensure no other changes are needed. The user only wants to add ride, so the rest stays the same. The snare is already present (S has hits), so the "not only hihat but also ride" implies that the hihat is okay, just need to add ride. The original has hihat, so adding ride is the main task.

Thus, the final answer should include the R line with the -X-X pattern.
