Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a snare hit and tom in the very beginning. Let me start by looking at the original groove provided.

The original K (Kick) line is "O---|---o|O-O-|----", so the first beat has a hard kick hit. The S (Snare) line starts with "----", meaning no snare in the first beat. The T (Toms) line is all dashes, so no toms initially. The user wants both a snare and a tom at the very start, which is the first 16th note of the first beat.

First, I need to add a snare hit on the first 16th note. Since the user didn't specify soft or hard, I'll go with the standard 'O' for a hard hit. So changing the first character of the S line from '-' to 'O', making it "O---|..." 

Next, the tom hit. The Toms line is all dashes, so I need to place an 'O' (hard hit) on the first 16th note as well. That changes the T line's first character to 'O', so "O---|...".

Wait, but I should check if there's any existing notes in the first beat that might clash. Looking at Hihat (H) and others, the first beat has "--o-" which is a soft open hit on the third 16th note. The kick is on the first, so adding snare and tom on the first should be okay rhythmically. 

Also, need to ensure that the total characters per line are 16. Let me confirm:

Original S line: "----|O---|----|O---" (16 characters)
After change: "O---|O---|----|O---" which is still 16.

For Toms, original is "----|----|----|----", changing first to "O---|----|----|----" keeps it at 16.

I think that's it. The user didn't mention modifying other parts, so the rest stays the same. Let me double-check the edit request again: "snare hit and tom in the very beginning" â€“ first 16th note of the first beat. Yep, that's covered.
