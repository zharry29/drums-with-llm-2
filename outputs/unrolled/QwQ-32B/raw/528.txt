Alright, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any tom or hihat parts from the given groove. 

First, I'll look at the original groove provided:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

Wait, actually, checking again, in the original, Hihat (H) is already all dashes except maybe some parts? Wait no, looking at the user's input:

The user's given groove is:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

So, looking at each line:

- **Kick (K):** Has some hits.
- **Snare (S):** Also has some hits, including Oo-o and others.
- **Hihat (H):** All dashes, so no hihat is being played. Wait, but the user says "I don't want any tom or hihat." But in this case, Hihat is already inactive. Maybe there was a mistake? Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the user's edit request is to remove any existing hihat and tom parts. Since in the original, H and T lines are already empty (all dashes), but maybe the ride (R) is present. However, the user's instruction is specifically about tom and hihat. 

Wait, the user's request is to remove tom and hihat. Since both are already inactive (T and H lines are all dashes except maybe something I missed?), then maybe the only change needed is to ensure that T and H are all dashes. Let me confirm each line again.

Looking at the given groove:

- **Hihat (H):** All dashes in all beats. So no hihat is present.
- **Toms (T):** Also all dashes. So no tom hits.

Therefore, the user's request might have been redundant, but perhaps there was a mistake in the input. However, the ride (R) has some hits. But the user didn't mention ride. Since the instruction is only about tom and hihat, the answer should leave other instruments as is except ensuring T and H are cleared. Since they already are, maybe the groove stays the same? But looking at the original R line has content, so the user might have wanted to remove all cymbals? Wait, no, the request was tom or hihat.

Wait, perhaps I misread the original. Let me check again.

Wait the user's edit request is: "I don't want any tom or hihat." So need to set T and H lines to all dashes. Since in the given groove, T is already all dashes, but H is also all dashes. So perhaps the groove is already compliant. But maybe there was a typo in the input? Alternatively, maybe the user's input had some hihat hits that need to be removed. Let me check the given groove again:

The given groove's H line is:

H: ----|----|----|----

Yes, all dashes. So no hihat. The T line is also all dashes. Therefore, the current groove already meets the request. But perhaps the user's original input had some hihat or tom that needs to be removed? Wait, perhaps in the initial problem statement, the example might have had some, but in this particular case, it's already clean. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to ensure that even if there were any, they are removed. Since in this case, they are already gone, the edited version would be the same as the original, except perhaps the ride? Wait, the user didn't mention ride. The user's instruction is only about tom and hihat. So the correct edited version would leave other instruments (like ride) as they are, but remove any tom and hihat. Since those are already gone, the answer is the same as the original, except maybe the ride? Wait no, the user didn't say to remove ride. 

Wait the user's request is only to remove tom and hihat. So the edited groove should have T and H lines as all dashes (which they already are) and leave the rest (K, S, C, R) as they are. Therefore, the answer would be the same as the original, except perhaps ensuring that any accidental hihat or tom hits are removed. Since they are already gone, the final answer is the same as the original, except maybe the ride? Wait no, the user didn't ask to remove ride. So the correct answer should keep the ride, as it's allowed. 

Wait but in the original, the ride (R) has content. The user's instruction doesn't mention ride, so it should remain. Therefore, the final edited groove would be exactly the same as the original, except maybe if there were any hihat or tom hits, but in this case, there aren't any. 

Wait but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me confirm again:

Original groove's T line is all dashes, so no tom. H line is all dashes, so no hihat. Therefore, the user's request is already met. So the edited version is the same as the original. But the user might have expected to remove the ride? No, the request was specifically tom and hihat. 

Therefore, the answer should be the same as the original, with T and H lines remaining as dashes. So the final answer would be the same as the input. But maybe the user's input had a typo, like the H line had something. Let me check again:

Looking at the user's input for the given groove:

H line is:

H: ----|----|----|----

Yes, all dashes. So no changes needed. Thus, the answer is the same as the input. But perhaps the user's example had different data. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user's given groove's R line has content. But since the user didn't mention ride, it stays. 

Therefore, the correct edited groove is identical to the original provided. But maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that even if H or T had content, they need to be removed. Since in this case they are already gone, the answer is the same. So I'll present that.
