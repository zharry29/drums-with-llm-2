Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the snare on beat 4 while keeping everything else the same. Let me start by understanding the given groove.

Looking at the Snare (S) line: "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o". Each part separated by | is a beat. The fourth beat here is "O--o". The user wants no snare there, so I need to replace those characters with '-'.

First, I'll break down each beat of the S line:
- Beat 1: "----" (no snare)
- Beat 2: "Oo-o" (has hits)
- Beat 3: "-o--" (has a soft open hit on the third 16th note)
- Beat 4: "O--o" (has a hard hit on the first 16th and a soft on the fourth)

The request is to remove snare on beat 4. So, I'll change "O--o" to "----". That should eliminate all snare hits in the fourth beat.

Now, checking the other lines to ensure they stay the same. The Kick (K), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R) lines shouldn't be altered. 

Let me reconstruct the S line with the change:
Original S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o  
Modified S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|----

Double-checking the other instruments:
- K remains "O--O|----|--O-|----"
- H is "X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-"
- T, C, R are all "----|----|----|----"

Yes, that looks correct. The only change is the fourth beat of the snare, now silent. I'll present the final groove with these adjustments.
