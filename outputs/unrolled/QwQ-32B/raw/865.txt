Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants an open hihat on the last 8th note. First, I need to recall the notation rules. Each line represents an instrument, and each character is a 16th note. The H line is for the hihat. 

Looking at the given groove:

H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

Breaking it down, each | separates beats. Since there are four beats per bar, each beat has four 16th notes. The last 8th note would be the third 16th note of the fourth beat. Wait, actually, an 8th note is two 16th notes. So the "last 8th note" might refer to the last two 16th notes of the bar. But the user says "last 8th note", so maybe just the third and fourth 16th notes of the fourth beat?

Wait, let's clarify. In a 4/4 bar with 16th notes, each beat is four 16ths. So the last 8th note would be the third and fourth 16th notes of the fourth beat (since an 8th note is two 16ths). But the user might mean the last 8th note of the bar, which is the fourth 16th note? Hmm, maybe I should look at the current H line.

Original H line:

--o- | O-o- | O-o- | O-o-

Breaking each beat:

Beat 1: --o-
Beat 2: O-o-
Beat 3: O-o-
Beat 4: O-o-

Each beat has four characters (16th notes). The last beat (fourth) is O-o-. So the last 8th note would be the third and fourth 16th notes here. The current last two notes are 'o-' (soft open hit on the third, nothing on the fourth). The user wants an open hit here. 

The Hihat's open hits are denoted by O or o. Since it's an open hit, maybe using 'O' for hard open. The user specified "open hihat", so perhaps replacing the last two 16th notes with open hits. But the instruction says "last 8th note", which is two 16th notes. So changing the last two 16th notes of the bar (fourth beat's third and fourth) to open hits. 

Original fourth beat's H: O-o- → the last two are 'o-' (soft open and rest). To make the last 8th note open, maybe change the last two to 'OO' (hard open on both), or 'O-' but maybe the user wants an open hit on the last 8th note, so perhaps the third and fourth notes (the 8th note) should be open. Let's see:

The fourth beat's H is currently O-o- (positions 1: O, 2: -, 3: o, 4: -). Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me parse each beat again:

Breaking down the H line:

First beat: characters 1-4: --o-
Second beat: 5-8: O-o-
Third beat: 9-12: O-o-
Fourth beat: 13-16: O-o-

Wait, the fourth beat's H line is O-o-, so positions 13: O, 14: -, 15: o, 16: -. 

The last 8th note would be the 15th and 16th 16th notes (since an 8th note is two 16ths). The current 15th is 'o' (soft open), and 16th is '-'. To make it an open hit on the last 8th note, perhaps changing the 15th and 16th to OO or Oo? But the user said "open hihat", so maybe a hard open hit on the last note. Since the 16th is the last 16th note of the bar, that's the end. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the last 8th note (which spans 15-16) to have an open hit. Since the current 15 is 'o', maybe just keeping that but making sure it's open. Alternatively, maybe they want the last two 16ths to be open. 

The user's instruction is a bit ambiguous, but the safest approach is to change the last two characters of the H line's fourth beat from '-o-' (wait, the fourth beat is O-o- → so the last two are 'o-'). To make the last 8th note (the last two 16ths) open, replace 'o-' with 'OO' (hard open on both) or 'O-' but maybe 'O-'? But 'O' is a hit, so the last two 16ths would need to have an open hit on the third (15th) and maybe the 16th as well. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the last 8th note (the 15th and 16th) to have an open hit on the 16th. Since it's the very end, maybe just changing the 16th character from '-' to 'O' (so the fourth beat becomes O-oO). But that would make the last 16th an open hit. 

Wait, let me re-express the H line's fourth beat: currently O-o- (positions 13-16). To have an open hit on the last 8th note (the 15th and 16th 16ths), perhaps changing the last two to OO, making it O-OO. But need to check the current notation. Let me see:

Original H line:
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
So the fourth beat's H is O-o-. 

If the user wants an open hit on the last 8th note (the last two 16ths), then changing the last two characters (positions 15 and 16) from 'o-' to 'OO' (hard open on both) would make sense. So the fourth beat becomes O-OO. 

Therefore, the modified H line would be:

H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-OO

Wait, but each beat is separated by |. So the fourth part is the fourth beat. So the fourth segment (after the last |) should be O-OO instead of O-o-.

Wait, original fourth segment is O-o-, so changing the last two characters from 'o-' to 'OO', resulting in O-OO. So the full H line becomes:

H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-OO

But let me confirm. Each beat is four characters. The fourth beat's original is O-o- (positions 13-16: O, -, o, -). Changing the last two (o and -) to O and O would make it O, -, O, O → so O-O O? Wait, the third character was 'o' becomes 'O', and the fourth becomes 'O'. So the fourth beat becomes O-O- (wait no, the third character becomes O and the fourth O). So O-O O? Wait, the third and fourth would be OO, so the fourth beat is O-O O? No, the first character is O, second -, third O, fourth O → so O-OO. 

Yes. So the H line would be:

H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-OO

Alternatively, maybe the user wants just the last 16th note to be open, so changing the last '-' to 'O', making the fourth beat O-oO. But the instruction says "last 8th note", which is two 16ths. So probably better to make both open. 

Therefore, the final H line would have the last segment as O-OO. 

Now, check other instruments to ensure no conflicts. The other lines remain the same. So the edited groove would be:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-OO  
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
