Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a drum pattern and wants to remove the hihat and tom parts. Let me first look at the original groove they gave.

Looking at the K (Kick) line: "-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-". That seems okay, but I need to check the other lines. The S (Snare) line has "----|----|S---|----". Wait, the user didn't mention removing the snare, only hihat and tom. So I should leave the snare as is. 

The H (Hihat) line is "x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-". Since the user wants no hihat, I need to replace all those x's and - with all dashes. Similarly, the T (Toms) line is "----|----|---O|----". The third beat has a tom hit (O), so that needs to be removed by changing it to dashes. The C (Crash) and R (Ride) lines are already empty except for crashes, but the user didn't mention crashes or ride, so leave those as they are unless specified. 

Wait, the edit request specifically says "no hihat or tom". So I'll set H to all dashes and T to all dashes. Let me double-check each line:

Original H line: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x- → becomes "----|----|----|----".

Original T line: ----|----|---O|---- → the third beat has "O", so change that to "---O" → "----". So the whole T line becomes "----|----|----|----".

The rest of the lines (K, S, C, R) stay the same except for H and T. Let me make sure the S line is okay. The user didn't ask to remove snare, so the "S---" in the third beat remains. But wait, in the S line, "S" is a sidestick hit (as per the notation, X and x are sidestick, but maybe S is a typo? Wait, looking back at the user's input, in their example, the S line uses X and x. Wait, in the problem description, under S: "X and x are hard and soft sidestick hits". The given groove has "S---" in the third beat. Wait, that might be an error because 'S' isn't listed as a valid character for the snare. But maybe it's a typo and should be 'X'? Or perhaps it's a mistake in the input. Since the user's instruction is to remove hihat and tom, maybe I should leave the S line as is unless it's invalid. But according to the notation rules, 'S' isn't a valid character for S (snare). The valid ones are O, o, X, x. So perhaps it's a mistake. However, since the user hasn't mentioned that, maybe I should proceed as given, just removing H and T. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended 'S' as a typo and it should be 'X'? But since I can't assume, I'll keep it as 'S' unless instructed otherwise. The user's edit is only about removing hihat and tom, so proceed accordingly.

So putting it all together, the edited groove would have H and T lines all dashes. Let me write that out.
