Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a snare hit and ride in the very beginning. Let me start by understanding the current groove.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

First, I need to focus on the first beat (the part before the first |). The user wants a snare hit (S line) and a ride hit (R line) there.

Currently, the first beat of the snare (S) is all dashes, meaning no hit. The ride (R) is also dashes. So I need to add an 'O' or another valid character for the snare on the first 16th note of the first beat. Since the user didn't specify soft or hard, but 'O' is the default hard hit, I'll use 'O' for the snare. 

For the ride (R), similarly, the first beat is dashes. The ride can have 'O' for a hard bell hit or 'X/x' for closed hits. Since they mentioned "ride in the beginning," probably the bell hit is better here, so 'O'.

Now, checking the kick (K) in the first beat is '-O--', so the first note is '-', second is 'O'. Adding the snare on the first note might clash with the kick's second note. But the user just wants it in the very beginning, so maybe on the first 16th note. Let's see:

Original first beat for S: ---- becomes O--- (snare hit on the first 16th note). 

For the ride, first beat was ----, so changing to O--- (ride hit on first 16th note).

Wait, but need to check if the kick and snare on the same 16th note is okay. The kick's first note is '-', so the first hit is actually on the second 16th note (the 'O'). So the snare on the first 16th note is fine. 

So the edited lines would be:

S: O---|----|S---|----
R: O---|----|----|----

Wait, but the original S line's third beat has 'S---', which might be a typo? Wait, in the given S line, it's "----|----|S---|----". The third beat has an 'S' which isn't a valid character for snare. Wait, checking the user's input again:

Wait in the user's input, the S line is written as:

S: ----|----|S---|----

Wait, but according to the notation rules, the S line can only have O, o, X, x, or -. The 'S' here is invalid. That's a mistake. Maybe it's a typo, perhaps they meant 'O'? Or maybe it's a placeholder. Since the user provided this, maybe it's an error. But since the user's instruction is to add a snare hit in the beginning, perhaps we can ignore that third beat's S and focus on the first.

So proceeding, changing the first beat of S to 'O---' and R to 'O---'.

Therefore, the edited groove would be:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: O---|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|----|----|----

But wait, the third beat of S still has 'S---', which is invalid. Since the user might have intended that, maybe it's better to correct it to 'O---' as well, but the user didn't mention editing that part. Since the instruction is only for the beginning, maybe leave it as is unless it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the 'S' was meant to be an 'O'. But I'll proceed with the user's input as given, just adding the first hit.
