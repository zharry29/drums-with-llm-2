Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the snare and tom parts. Let me first look at the original groove they provided.

Starting with the Kick (K): "O---|----|O---|----". That's fine, no snare or tom involved there. The Snare (S) line has "----|O---|----|O---", so I need to replace those O's with dashes. The Toms (T) are already all dashes, so nothing to do there. The Hihat (H) is "X---|X---|X---|X---", which I need to check. Wait, the user said no snare or tom, so hihat is okay? Wait, the request was "no snare or tom", so hihat is part of the hi-hat, which is separate. So leave H as is. Wait, but maybe I should double-check. The user might have meant to remove other parts, but according to the instruction, only snare and tom are to be removed. 

Wait, let me confirm the instruments. The S line is snare, T is toms. So I need to clear out S and T lines. The H line is hihat, which is allowed. The C and R lines (crash and ride) are already empty, so they stay. 

So, for the Snare line (S), replace all non-dash characters with dashes. The original S line is "----|O---|----|O---", so changing the O's to dashes gives "----|----|----|----".

The Toms line (T) is already all dashes, so no change. The rest remain as they are. Let me put it all together:

K remains: O---|----|O---|----
S becomes: ----|----|----|----
H stays: X---|X---|X---|X---
T stays: ----|----|----|----
C and R are already empty.

Wait, let me check the original input again. The user's given groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, so after removing snare (S) and tom (T), the S line's O's become dashes, and T is already clear. The final should have S as all dashes and T as well. The Hihat is okay since it's not part of the excluded instruments. So the edited version should look like this.
