Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the snare on beat 4 while keeping everything else the same. Let me first parse the original groove provided.

Looking at the S (Snare) line: "----|X---|--X-|----". Breaking it down by beats:

- Beat 1: "----" (no snare)
- Beat 2: "X---" (snare hits on the first 16th note of the second beat)
- Beat 3: "--X-" (snare on the third 16th note of the third beat)
- Beat 4: "----" (no snare originally?)

Wait, the user says "don't want snare on beat 4", but in the original, beat 4 of the snare is already "----". Hmm, maybe I need to double-check.

Wait, let me look again. The original S line is:

S: ----|X---|--X-|----

So the four beats are separated by |. Let's list each beat:

First beat: "----" (no snare)
Second beat: "X---" (only the first 16th note has an X)
Third beat: "--X-" (third 16th note has an X)
Fourth beat: "----" (no snare here)

Wait, so actually, in the original, the snare isn't playing on beat 4. So maybe the user made a mistake? Or perhaps there's an error in the input? But maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, the user's edit request says "I don't want snare on beat 4 but everything else is fine." But according to the original S line, the fourth beat is "----", so snare is already not present. That's confusing. Maybe the user intended to remove something else, but perhaps there's a typo in the input?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the beat structure. Let me check the notation again. Each line has 16 characters separated into four beats of four 16th notes each. So each | separates the beats. Let me confirm each beat's positions:

Original S line:

Beat 1: characters 1-4: "----" (no hits)
Beat 2: next 4: "X---" (first 16th note is X, rest '-')
Beat 3: next 4: "--X-" (third 16th note is X)
Beat 4: last 4: "----" (no hits)

So indeed, the snare isn't playing on beat 4. Therefore, the user's request might be based on a mistake, but since the instruction says to proceed, maybe I should check if there's another part. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant beat 3? Or maybe there's a miscount in the beats.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the fourth beat in a different way. Let me check the other lines to see if there's a snare in another part. Looking at the original groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The only snare hits are in beats 2 and 3. The fourth beat's snare is already silent. Therefore, perhaps the user's request is redundant, but to comply, I should make sure that beat 4's snare remains as it is, which is already "----".

Wait, perhaps there's a typo in the original input? Let me check the user's input again. The user provided the groove as:

@@@
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Yes, the S line's fourth beat is indeed "----". Therefore, the user might have intended to target a different beat, but since the instruction says to remove snare on beat 4, and it's already not there, the edited groove would be the same as the original. However, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the beats. Let me recount:

Each beat is four 16th notes. The S line is:

Beat1: "----"

Beat2: "X---" (X at first 16th of beat 2)

Beat3: "--X-" (X at third 16th of beat 3)

Beat4: "----"

So indeed, beat4 has no snare. Therefore, the edit doesn't change anything. But the user might have intended to remove something else, but I should follow the instruction as given. Since there's no snare in beat4, the result remains the same. However, perhaps the user intended to remove the snare in beat3? But the request specifies beat4. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's edit request was meant to remove the snare in the fourth 16th note of beat4, but since it's already empty, I can just present the original as the edited version. But perhaps the user made a mistake in their request, but I have to follow it regardless.

Therefore, the edited groove would be the same as the original. However, looking at the previous examples, sometimes when there was a note to remove, the assistant just left it as is. Let me confirm once more.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's original S line had a typo, but given the input I have to work with, I have to proceed. So the final answer would be the same as the original, but perhaps the user expects that. Alternatively, maybe I misread the original S line.

Wait, let me check again:

The S line is written as:

S: ----|X---|--X-|----

Breaking it down:

- First beat: "----" (4 characters, first beat)
- Second beat: "X---" (second beat)
- Third beat: "--X-" (third beat)
- Fourth beat: "----" (fourth beat)

Yes, so beat4's snare is already empty. Therefore, no changes needed. But since the user is asking to remove it, perhaps the answer is the same as before. So the final edited groove would be identical to the original. But in the examples given earlier, sometimes when there was nothing to change, the assistant just returned the original. However, maybe the user intended a different beat. Alternatively, maybe I need to check other instruments? The user specifically mentioned snare, so only the S line is relevant.

Therefore, the correct edited groove would have the S line's fourth beat as "----", which it already is. Therefore, the output is the same as the input. But maybe the user expects that. So I'll present the same drum groove as the edited version.
