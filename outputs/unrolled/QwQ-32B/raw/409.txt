Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any hihat or cymbal parts. First, I need to recall which lines correspond to those instruments. From the notation key:

- **H** is Hihat
- **C** is Crash cymbal
- **R** is Ride cymbal

So, I need to set all the characters in the H, C, and R lines to '-' (no hit). Let me check the original groove provided:

Original Groove:
```
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Looking at the H line, it's already all '-' except maybe the structure? Wait, no, the H line here is already empty. But the C line has crashes in every beat. The R line is empty. So the main changes needed are to set the C line to all '-' and ensure H is clear. Since H is already clear, the main action is the C line.

So the edited version should have:

- **C:** all '-' 
- Keep K, S, T as they are unless they have hihat or cymbal, but they don't. 

Let me double-check. The user said "no hihat or cymbal," so:

- H line stays as all '-'
- C line (crash) becomes all '-'
- R line (ride) is already all '-', so that's fine.

So the final edited groove should look like:

```
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

I think that's it. Just making sure no other lines have cymbals. The S line is snare, which is okay. Toms are allowed. The user didn't mention kick or snare, so those stay. Yep, that should do it.
