Okay, let's see. The user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing any ride or tom parts. The original groove is given, and I need to make sure that the final result doesn't have any notes on the R (ride) or T (toms) lines.

First, I'll look at the given drum notation:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user's request is to remove ride (R) and tom (T) parts. So, I need to set both T and R lines to all '-' characters. 

Looking at the T line, it has "O-o-" repeated in each beat. To remove toms, I'll replace all those with '-'.

The R line is already all '-', so no changes needed there. But just to be thorough, I'll confirm that there are no ride hits. 

Also, check other lines to ensure no accidental edits. The K, S, H, and C lines should stay as they are. 

So the edited version should have T and R lines empty. Let me structure that:

K remains:
O---|O---|----|O---

S remains:
----|----|O---|----

H remains:
----|----|----|----

T becomes:
----|----|----|----

R is already:
----|----|----|----

Double-checking that I didn't touch other lines. Yep, looks good. That should fulfill the user's request.
