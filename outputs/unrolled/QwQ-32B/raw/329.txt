Okay, let's see. The user wants me to edit a drum groove so that there's no ride or snare. The original groove has some kick, hihat, toms, and crash. Let me look at the given drum notation first to make sure I understand everything.

The original groove is:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

The user's edit request is to remove any ride (R) and snare (S). So I need to set the S and R lines to all dashes. Let me check each line:

- **Kick (K):** The kick has some hits, like "-O--" etc. Since the request is about removing snare and ride, I don't need to touch the kick. It stays as is.
- **Snare (S):** The third beat has "S---". I need to replace all S entries with '-'.
- **Hihat (H):** All "x-x-" patterns. Since hihat isn't mentioned in the request, it stays.
- **Toms (T):** The third beat has "---O". Tom hits are okay unless specified, so leave them.
- **Crash (C):** All "O---". The user didn't mention removing crashes, so they stay.
- **Ride (R):** It's already all dashes except maybe in the example? Wait, in the original, R is all dashes. Wait the user's original R line is all dashes. So maybe there was a mistake, but the user still wants to ensure no ride. So set R to all dashes anyway.

Wait, in the given groove, the R line is already all dashes. So maybe the user just wants to make sure that even if there were any ride hits, they are removed. But in this case, it's already clean. So just set S to all dashes.

So the edited version should have S line as all dashes and R as well (though R was already clean). Let me double-check:

Original S line: third beat has "S---". So changing that to "----".

So the final K line remains: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S becomes: ----|----|----|----
Other lines stay the same except R is already clear. So the new groove should look like:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|----|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, but the user might have wanted to ensure that even if there were any ride parts, they are gone. Since R was already all dashes, that's fine. The main change is removing the snare hits, especially that S in the third beat. That's all. I think that's it. Let me confirm once more. Yep, that should do it.
