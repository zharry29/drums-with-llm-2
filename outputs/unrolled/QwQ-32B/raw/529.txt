Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any tom or hihat parts. 

First, I'll look at the original groove provided. The instruments involved are Kick (K), Snare (S), Toms (T), and maybe others. The user specifically mentioned removing toms and hihats. 

Looking at the given drum notation:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So, the Toms (T) line has O-o- repeating in each beat. Since the user doesn't want toms, I need to replace all those characters with '-' to indicate no hit. 

Also, the Hihat (H) line is all '-', so there's nothing there. But just to be sure, since the user mentioned removing hihats, even if there were notes, they should be cleared. In this case, H is already empty.

The other lines (Kick, Snare, Crash, Ride) are okay as they don't involve toms or hihats. So the main change is on the T line. 

Let me double-check the request again: "I don't want any tom or hihat." So confirming that T and H lines should be all '-'.

Updating the T line to all '-' and leaving others as is. That should fulfill the request. Let me make sure there are 16 characters per line (4 beats of 4 notes each). Each line after | should have four characters. 

Original T line: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o- becomes ----|----|----|----

Yes, that's correct. No other changes needed. The final groove should have T and H lines cleared.
