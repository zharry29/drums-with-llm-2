Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any ride or snare parts. Let me first look at the original groove they provided.

Starting with the Kick (K line): "O--O|----|--O-|----". That looks fine because it's only kick and no snare or ride. The Snare (S line) has some hits: "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o". Since the user doesn't want snare, I need to replace all those with dashes. 

Then the Hihat (H line) is "X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-". That's okay because hihat is allowed. The Toms (T) and Crash (C) are empty, so they're already good. The Ride (R) is all dashes, so no problem there either. 

Wait, the user said "no ride or snare", so I just need to make sure S and R lines are cleared. The R line is already clear, so just the S line needs to be all dashes. Let me double-check each part of the S line and replace every non-dash with a dash. 

So the new S line should be "----|----|----|----". The rest of the instruments stay the same except ensuring R remains empty. Let me reconstruct the entire groove with these changes. 

Final check: Kick remains, Snare gone, Hihat stays, Toms and Crash as they were, Ride still empty. Yep, that should meet the user's request.
