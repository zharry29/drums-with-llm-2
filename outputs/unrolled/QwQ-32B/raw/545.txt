Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any ride or kick elements. First, I need to recall which lines correspond to those instruments. From the notation guide, K is the kick drum and R is the ride cymbal. 

Looking at the given groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So, the Kick (K) has hits on the first and third beats of the bar. The Ride (R) is completely silent here, but the user still wants it removed. To comply, I'll set all K and R lines to all dashes. 

The Snare (S) and Hihat (H) are okay as they are, since the user didn't mention them. Toms (T) and Crash (C) are already inactive. 

So replacing K and R lines with all '-' characters. Let me double-check each line. The K line becomes ----|----|----|---- and R is already empty but set to same. That should do it.
