Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a specific drum notation and wants me to remove any hihat (H) and ride (R) parts from the given groove. 

First, I'll look at the original groove provided:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

The user's request is to eliminate the hihat (H) and ride (R) components. 

Starting with the H line, I see it's already all dashes, meaning no hihat was being used. So that's already compliant. But the R line has some hits. The R line uses 'o' and 'O', which are soft and hard hits on the bell or bow. Since the user doesn't want any ride, I need to replace all those characters with '-'.

Looking at each part of the R line:

First beat: o-O- becomes ----
Second beat: o-O- becomes ----
Third beat: o-O- becomes ----
Fourth beat: o-O- becomes ----

So the edited R line should be all dashes. 

The rest of the instruments (K, S, T, C) don't involve hihat or ride, so they stay as they are. The snare (S) has some articulations like 'Oo-o' and '-o--', which are allowed since the user only removed hihat and ride. The kick (K) and crash (C) are also unaffected.

Wait, checking the crash (C) line: it's all dashes here, so no issue. The toms (T) are also silent. 

So the final groove should have H and R lines all dashes. Let me double-check to ensure no other instruments are affected. Yep, looks good. The user's main request is addressed by zeroing out the R line. Since H was already clear, that's done.
