Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this drum groove edit. The user provided a drum notation example and a specific groove that needs to be modified. The edit request is to include not only the tom but also the hihat. 

First, I'll look at the original groove they provided:

@@@
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, hold on. Wait, the original groove's H line (hihat) already has some hits. Let me check again. The H line shows "--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-". That means the hihat is already being played in some places. But the edit request says "The groove should have not only tom but also hihat." Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Because if the hihat is already present, maybe the user wants to add more hihat or ensure that both tom and hihat are present? Or perhaps in the original, the tom isn't being used, so they want to add tom parts while keeping the hihat?

Wait, looking at the T line (Toms) in the given groove: it's all dashes, so no tom hits. The user's request is to have not only tom (so add tom) but also hihat (but hihat is already there). Maybe the user meant that the groove should have both tom and hihat, but in the original, the hihat is there but the tom isn't. So the task is to add tom parts while keeping the existing hihat.

Alternatively, maybe the user's wording was a bit off, and they want to add both tom and hihat where they were missing. But in this case, hihat is already present, so maybe the main task is to add tom parts.

Let me confirm the problem again. The original groove has hihat but no toms. The edit request is to include not only tom but also hihat. Since hihat is already there, the main action is to add tom parts.

So I need to add some tom hits in the T line. The user probably wants the tom to complement the existing parts without conflicting. Let's look at the structure of the groove:

Looking at each beat (separated by |):

First beat (K: O---): Kick hits on first 16th note. Snare is silent. Hihat has a soft open hit on the third 16th note (since H: --o-).

Second beat (K: ---o): Kick on the fourth 16th note. Snare has an O on the second position (S: O---). Hihat has O-o-: hard open on first, soft on third.

Third beat (K: O-O-): Kick on first and third 16th notes. Snare is silent. Hihat has O-o- again.

Fourth beat (K: ----): No kick. Snare on last 16th note (O---). Hihat starts with O-o- but the last part is O-o- as well.

So to add tom, I should place T hits where they fit. The Toms can have O (hard) or o (soft). Maybe on the offbeats or syncopated positions.

Looking at the first beat: K is O---, so first note is kick. Maybe add a tom on the second or fourth 16th. Let's see:

First beat T: perhaps on the second 16th (so "-O--" or "-o--"), but need to check with the existing instruments. Alternatively, third or fourth.

Alternatively, maybe a consistent pattern across all beats. For example, adding a tom on every other beat's third 16th note. Or following the kick's pattern?

Alternatively, since the hihat is already active, maybe the toms can add some accents. Let me think of a simple pattern. Let's try adding a tom hit on the second 16th note of each beat. So in each T line segment, like "-O--" for each beat.

Wait, let's try:

For each beat's T line:

First beat: T: -O-- (so second 16th note)

Second beat: ---O (fourth 16th note, since the kick is on the fourth here)

Third beat: Maybe similar to first? Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe a pattern like ---O on each beat. Wait, but that would be on the fourth 16th of each beat. Let me see:

Alternatively, to make it consistent, maybe a tom on the second and fourth 16th notes of each beat. Like "-O-O".

Wait, but each beat is four characters. So for each beat's T line:

If I do "-O--", that's second 16th note.

Or "-O-O" for second and fourth.

Alternatively, let's see the existing kick and snare:

In the first beat, the kick is on 1, so maybe tom on 3? Let's see the third 16th note. So "O--O" but that might clash with kick on first. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's try adding a tom hit on the third 16th note of each beat. So each T segment would be "--O-". That would be third 16th note.

Alternatively, maybe syncopation between kick and tom. Let's try:

First beat T: "-O--" (second 16th note). That doesn't interfere with kick on first.

Second beat T: ---O (fourth 16th note, since the kick is on fourth, but maybe that's okay? Or maybe a tom on third?

Alternatively, let's consider the hihat's pattern. The hihat has some open hits. Maybe aligning tom hits with the hihat's closed or open hits.

Alternatively, a simple pattern like adding a tom hit on every other beat's third 16th. Let me try to make it simple.

Alternatively, looking at previous examples the user provided in the history, when adding tom, they often placed it every beat on the third or fourth position. For example in previous edits, like T: -O--| -O-- etc. So maybe the user expects a consistent tom pattern.

Let me try adding a tom on the third 16th note of each beat. So each T segment would be "--O-".

So for the four beats:

T: "--O-| --O-| --O-| --O-"

But check if that works with the existing parts.

Alternatively, maybe the first beat's T is "--O-", so third 16th note.

Second beat's T: same "--O-", so third note.

Third beat's T: same.

Fourth beat's T: same.

Alternatively, maybe a different pattern. Let me see the existing hihat:

First beat H: --o- so third note is o (soft open).

Second beat H: O-o- first note O, third o.

Third beat H: O-o-

Fourth beat H: O-o-

So maybe the tom can be on the third note where the hihat has a soft hit. So "--O-" would align with that. Using O (hard tom) there.

Alternatively, maybe using O for harder hits where the kick is also present. Let me see:

In the first beat, kick is on first 16th, so tom on third (third 16th). That might create a nice syncopation.

Similarly, second beat's kick is on fourth, so tom on third again.

Third beat, kick is on first and third, so maybe tom on second? Hmm, conflicting with kick's third. Maybe better to avoid overlapping with kick.

Alternatively, third beat's kick is on first and third, so maybe tom on second and fourth? Like "-O-O".

Hmm, this is getting a bit complex. Maybe the simplest approach is to add a tom hit on the third 16th note of each beat, using O (hard hits). So each T segment is "--O-".

Thus, the T line would be:

T: "--O-| --O-| --O-| --O-"

But let me check each beat:

First beat T: "--O-" → third 16th note.

Second beat T: same → third note.

Third beat T: same.

Fourth beat T: same.

Alternatively, maybe varying it a bit to add some interest. For example, on the first and third beats, have "--O-", and on second and fourth, maybe "---O".

Alternatively, maybe follow the kick's pattern. For example, in the first beat, kick is O---, so first note. Tom on third.

Second beat's kick is ---o (fourth note). Tom on third again.

Third beat's kick is O-O- (first and third), so tom could be on second?

Alternatively, perhaps a pattern like "-O--" on each beat. So first beat T: -O--, so second note.

Let me see if that works:

First beat T: -O-- (second note). That doesn't interfere with kick on first.

Second beat T: -O-- (second note), which is okay since kick is on fourth.

Third beat T: -O-- (second note). Since kick is on first and third, the tom on second is okay.

Fourth beat T: -O-- (second note). Since kick is not there, that's fine.

This might create a consistent eighth note tom pattern on the "and" of each beat.

Alternatively, that could work. Let's try that.

Thus, T line would be:

T: -O--| -O--| -O--| -O--

So each beat's T has a hit on the second 16th note.

Alternatively, maybe combining both second and fourth. Let me see.

Alternatively, check previous examples. Looking back at the user's previous interactions, when they added tom, they often placed it every beat on the third or fourth position. For instance, in the first example provided by the user, the T line was T: ---O|---O|---O|O---, which is fourth note for the first three beats and first note on the fourth. But that might not be consistent.

Alternatively, another example in the user's history had T: -O-O|-O-O etc., creating a dotted rhythm.

Hmm, perhaps the best approach here is to choose a simple pattern that adds toms without clashing and provides a steady rhythm. Let me go with adding a tom hit on the third 16th note of each beat (using O), so T: "--O-| --O-| --O-| --O-".

Alternatively, maybe the fourth beat can have a different pattern to end strongly. Let me see the fourth beat's existing elements: kick is silent, snare on last note, hihat O-o- (so first and third 16th notes). So putting a tom on the third and fourth? Maybe "--OO" for the fourth beat. But that might be too much.

Alternatively, keeping it consistent across all four beats with "--O-" would be safer.

Another consideration: the crash cymbal (C) is only on the first beat (O---). Maybe the toms can emphasize the crash? But the edit doesn't mention crash, so probably not necessary.

So finalizing the T line as "--O-" for each beat.

Therefore, the edited groove would have:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-  (Wait, no, each beat's T line should be four characters. Wait, each segment is four characters separated by |. So for four beats, each T segment is four characters. So for each beat:

First beat: "--O-" → third note hit.

Second beat: "--O-"

Third beat: "--O-"

Fourth beat: "--O-"

Thus, the T line would be "--O-|--O-|--O-|--O-".

Wait, but the fourth beat's T line would be "--O-" as well. Let me write that out:

T: "--O-|--O-|--O-|--O-"

But let me check the fourth beat's Hihat is O-o-, so first and third notes. The tom on third would coincide with hihat's third note (soft open). That's okay, they can play together.

Alternatively, maybe using a soft hit o on tom for the fourth note? Not sure. Since the user's previous edits used O for tom hits, probably stick with O.

So the final edited groove would have the T line filled in as above, and the H line remains as it was since the user wanted to add tom but also ensure hihat is present, which it already is.

Therefore, the answer should be:

@@@
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

Wait, but in the fourth beat of T, the original T line was "----", so adding "--O-" there. But let me confirm each segment:

First beat: "--O-"

Second beat: "--O-" (so the second beat's T is "--O-")

Third beat: "--O-"

Fourth beat: "--O-"

Yes. That should do it. Adding tom hits on the third 16th note of each beat. That should satisfy the edit request.
