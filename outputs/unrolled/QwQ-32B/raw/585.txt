Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the snare and ride parts from the given groove. First, I need to recall the structure of the drum notation provided. Each line corresponds to a different drum component: K for kick, S for snare, H for hihat, T for toms, C for crash cymbal, and R for ride cymbal. Each character in the line represents a 16th note, with '-' meaning no hit, and other characters indicating specific hits.

Looking at the original groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user's request is to eliminate the snare (S) and ride (R). So, I need to set all the S and R lines to all '-' characters. Let me check each line:

- **Kick (K):** The kick has hits on the first and third beats. Since the user didn't mention removing kick, leave it as is.
- **Snare (S):** The snare has hits on the second and fourth beats. Need to replace all characters here with '-'.
- **Hihat (H):** The hihat is playing every beat with 'X', which are closed hits. The user didn't mention hihat, so leave it.
- **Toms (T):** All '-' so no action needed.
- **Crash (C):** Also all '-', so no change.
- **Ride (R):** All '-', but since the user mentioned ride, maybe it's better to explicitly set it to all '-' just in case there were any hits.

Wait, in the original, R is already all '-', but maybe the user wants to ensure that even if there were any, they're removed. So setting R to all '-' is safe.

So, modifying the S and R lines:

Original S: "----|O---|----|O---" becomes "----|----|----|----"
Original R: "----|----|----|----" stays the same, but confirm it's all '-'.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should look like this:

K remains the same, S and R become all '-', others stay as they are. Let me double-check the counts to ensure each line has exactly 16 characters (including the | separators). Each segment between | is 4 characters, so 4 segments make 16 notes.

Yes, each line after editing should maintain the structure. No mistakes spotted. So the final answer should be the edited version with S and R cleared.
