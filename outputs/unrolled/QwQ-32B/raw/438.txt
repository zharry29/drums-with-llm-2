Okay, let's see. The user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing the kick and ride parts. The original groove is given in that drum notation format. First, I need to understand each line. 

The lines are K for kick, S for snare, H for hihat, T for toms, C for crash, and R for ride. The user said "no kick or ride," so I need to set K and R lines to all dashes. Let me check the original:

Original K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
So replacing all those Os and - with dashes. Then R line is already all dashes, so that's fine. The other lines (S, H, T, C) stay as they are unless they have something that needs to be removed, but the user only mentioned kick and ride. 

Wait, let me double-check the input. The original R line is all dashes, so no change there. The S line has some stuff, but since the user didn't mention snare, leave it. H and T are empty except maybe some hihat, but user didn't say to remove those. The crash is there, but also allowed unless specified. 

So the edited version should have K and R lines all dashes. Let me write that out. Make sure each line has 16 characters (4 beats of 4 notes each). 

For K: All characters become '-', so four sets of '----|' making '----|----|----|----'. 

R line was already all dashes, so no change. 

Double-checking everything else stays the same. Yep, that should be it.
