Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants snare on every 16th note in the second beat. Let me start by understanding the original groove and then figure out how to meet the request.

Looking at the given drum groove:

**Kick (K):** o---|--o-|o---|--o-
**Snare (S):** ----|X---|--X-|----
**Hihat (H):** ----|x---|----|x---
**Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----
**Crash (C):** ----|----|----|----
**Ride (R):** x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The user's request is to have snare hits on every 16th note in the second beat. Let's break this down.

First, the second beat is the part between the second and third |. In the original Snare line for the second beat, it's "X---". The second beat is four 16th notes, so to have a snare on every 16th note here, each of those four notes should have a snare hit. 

The current S line for the second beat is "X---", meaning only the first 16th note of the second beat has a snare hit (X). To fulfill the request, we need to replace those three '-' with either 'X' or 'x' to make it "XXXX" or "xxxx" or a mix. Since the original uses 'X' and 'x' (sidestick hits), maybe keeping the same articulation makes sense. But the user didn't specify articulation, just that it should be a snare hit. 

However, looking at the Snare's notation rules: S can use O, o, X, or x. Since the user didn't specify, but the original second beat has X (hard sidestick), maybe we should stick with X for consistency. So changing the second beat's S line to "XXXX".

Wait, but the original second beat in S is "|X---", so the second beat's four notes are X, -, -, -. To make every 16th note a snare hit, it should be "XXXX".

But I need to check the rest of the groove to ensure it doesn't exceed any previous constraints. The user's edit request here is only about the snare in the second beat, so other parts can stay unless conflicting. Let me confirm the other lines.

Looking at the original S line:
S: ---- (first beat) | X--- (second beat) | --X- (third beat) | ---- (fourth beat)

After the change, the second beat becomes "XXXX", so the full S line would be:
S: ----|XXXX|--X-|----

Wait, but the third beat's original is "--X-", so the third beat's third note is X. The user's request is only about the second beat, so that's okay.

Now, check if this addition causes any issues with the total number of notes. The user's previous requests sometimes limited notes, but in this case, the current edit request doesn't mention a note limit, only the snare requirement. So proceed.

Therefore, the edited S line would be:

S: ----|XXXX|--X-|----

But let me double-check the original's third beat in S: "--X-" which is three '-' and an X. The user's request doesn't affect that, so it remains.

Now, putting it all together with the rest of the instruments unchanged (since the request is only about the snare), the final groove should look like this.
