Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing the ride and hihat parts. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided.

Looking at the given drum notation:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So, breaking this down:

- **Kick (K):** There are hits on the first 16th note of the first and third beats (O--- and O---).
- **Snare (S):** Hits on the second beat's first 16th note and the fourth beat's first 16th note (O--- and O---).
- **Hihat (H):** All four beats have X---, which according to the notation, X is a hard closed hit. Since the user doesn't want hihat, I need to remove all H entries.
- **Toms (T):** Nothing here, all dashes.
- **Crash (C):** Also nothing.
- **Ride (R):** All dashes, so no ride is already present. But the user still mentions removing ride, maybe just to be thorough.

The user's request is to remove any ride or hihat. Since Hihat is active here with X's, I need to set H's line to all dashes. The Ride (R) line is already empty, so that's fine. The other instruments (Kick, Snare, Toms, Crash) can stay as they are unless instructed otherwise. The user didn't mention Kick or Snare, so leave those alone.

Let me double-check the notation rules to make sure I'm not missing anything. Hihat's X is a closed hit, but removing it just means setting those positions to '-', right? Yes. And since the user didn't mention Toms or Crash, those remain untouched. The edited version should only have K, S, T, and C lines as before, but H and R cleared.

Wait, in the original, R is already all dashes, so no change needed there. Just H needs to be set to all dashes. Let me confirm the positions again:

Original H line: X---|X---|X---|X---
After removal: ----|----|----|----

Yes. So the final edited groove should have H and R lines all dashes, others unchanged. Let me write that out.
