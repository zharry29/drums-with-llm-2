Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to avoid having the snare on the downbeats of beats 2 and 4. First, I need to understand the original groove structure.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The snare (S line) has hits on the second and fourth beats. Specifically, in the second beat (after the first |), there's an "Oo-o" which includes a hit on the first 16th note of that beat (the downbeat of beat 2). Similarly, the fourth beat has "O--o", so the first 16th note of beat 4 (the downbeat) has an "O" hit. The user wants these downbeats removed.

So, I need to adjust the snare line to remove those hits. Let's break it down beat by beat:

Original S line breakdown:
Beat 1: ---- (no hits)
Beat 2: Oo-o (first 16th note is O, so the downbeat of beat 2 is hit)
Beat 3: -o-- (third beat's first 16th note is -, so no downbeat hit)
Beat 4: O--o (first 16th note is O, so downbeat of beat 4 is hit)

To remove the downbeats on 2 and 4, we need to replace the first character of beats 2 and 4 in the S line with '-'.

So for beat 2: Oo-o becomes -o-o (changing the first O to -)
For beat 4: O--o becomes - --o (changing the first O to -)

Wait, let me make sure. Let me write each beat's characters:

Original S line:
Beat1: "----"
Beat2: "Oo-o"
Beat3: "-o--"
Beat4: "O--o"

So the downbeats are the first character of each beat. So beat2's first character is O, beat4's first character is O. Changing those to '-'.

So new S line would be:

Beat1: ----
Beat2: -o-o
Beat3: -o--
Beat4: --o (wait, original fourth beat's first character is O, so changing to -, making it "- --o" but need to keep four characters. So "O--o" becomes "- --o" which is four characters: "- - - o"? Wait no, the fourth beat's S line is "O--o", so the four characters are O, -, -, o. Changing the first to '-', so becomes "- - - o" which is "- --o".

Putting it all together, the new S line would be:

S: ----|-o-o|-o--|--o

Wait, let me check again:

Original S line was:

S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o

After changes:

First beat remains ----
Second beat: Oo-o → -o-o (replace first O with -)
Third beat remains -o--
Fourth beat: O--o → - --o (so "- --o")

So the new S line becomes:

S: ----|-o-o|-o--|--o

Wait, but the fourth part after the last | should have four characters. Let me check:

Original fourth segment: O--o (four characters: O, -, -, o)
After change: - (first), then the rest: -, -, o → so "- - - o" but written as "- --o".

Yes, that's four characters. So the full S line is:

S: ----|-o-o|-o--|--o

Wait, but the last segment is |--o, but the fourth beat's segment should be four characters. Let me count:

Original: O--o is four characters. Changing to "- - - o" (four characters). So the fourth segment would be "- - - o" which is written as "- --o".

So putting it all together:

S: ----|-o-o|-o--|--o ?

Wait, the fourth segment should be four characters. Let me check again:

Original fourth beat's S segment: "O--o" → becomes "- --o" which is four characters (each segment is four characters separated by |).

Yes, so the entire S line becomes:

S: ----|-o-o|-o--|--o

Wait, the last part is |--o, but that's three characters? No, "- --o" is four characters. Let me write it again:

Original S line segments:

1: ----
2: Oo-o
3: -o--
4: O--o

After changes:

1: ----
2: -o-o (four characters: '-', 'o', '-', 'o')
3: -o-- (same as before)
4: - --o (four characters: '-', '-', '-', 'o')

So the S line becomes:

S: ----|-o-o|-o--|--o ?

Wait, the fourth segment should be "- --o" but written as "- --o" which is four characters. So the entire line would be:

S: ----|-o-o|-o--|---o ?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-express each segment properly.

Original fourth segment: O--o → replacing the first character (O) with '-', so the first character is '-', then the next three are '-', '-', 'o' → so the four characters are '-', '-', '-', 'o', which is written as "---o".

Ah! That's better. So the fourth segment becomes "---o".

Therefore, the corrected S line is:

S: ----|-o-o|-o--|---o

Wait, let me confirm:

Original fourth beat's S part was O--o. Changing the first character to '-', so the first is '-', then the next three characters are '-', '-', 'o', so combined as "- - - o" → written as "---o".

Yes, that's correct. So the fourth segment is "---o".

Therefore, the new S line is:

S: ----|-o-o|-o--|---o

Now, let's check the rest of the instruments to ensure no other changes are needed. The user only asked about the snare on beats 2 and 4's downbeats. The other lines (K, H, T, C, R) remain as they were unless there's a dependency, but the user's instruction is only about the snare.

So the final edited groove should have the S line adjusted as above. Let me reconstruct all lines:

K remains:
K: O--O|----|--O-|----

S becomes:
S: ----|-o-o|-o--|---o

H remains:
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

T, C, R remain unchanged:
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, let me check the original's T line was all dashes except maybe? The original T line given was:

Original T line:
T: ----|----|----|----

So no changes there. The user's request was only about snare.

Therefore, the final drum groove should look like this with the S line adjusted.
