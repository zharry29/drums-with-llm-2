Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to include not just the snare but also the tom. Looking at the given groove:

First, let's parse the existing elements. The Kick (K) has some soft hits, the Snare (S) has X and x hits, the Hihat (H) has some activity, and the Toms (T) are completely silent. The Ride (R) has some patterns too.

The edit request is to add tom hits. Since the current T line is all dashes, I need to place some O or o characters in there. The key is to integrate the toms in a way that complements the existing snare and kick without clashing.

Looking at the structure of each beat (each | separates 4 beats, each beat has 4 16th notes):

Original T line:
T: ----|----|----|----

I need to decide where to place the toms. Maybe syncopate them with the snare or kick. Let's see the snare pattern:

S: ----|X---|--X-|----

In the second beat, there's an X on the first 16th note, and in the third beat, an X on the third 16th. The fourth beat has an X on the first 16th again.

Maybe place toms on offbeats. For example, in the first beat, maybe add a tom on the third 16th note (since kick is o there). Let's see:

First beat: o--- so maybe add a tom on the third note: o--O ?

But need to check the existing instruments. Also, in the second beat, the snare is X on the first, so maybe a tom on the fourth? Let's see:

Second beat: --o- (kick is --o-), so maybe on the third or fourth? If snare is on first, perhaps tom on fourth: ---O ?

Third beat: o---, so maybe third note again: o--O ?

Fourth beat: --o-, similar to second.

Alternatively, maybe mirror the snare's pattern but offset. Let me try:

T: ---O|---O|---O|---O (each beat's last 16th note). That would create a steady tom on the & of each beat's fourth 16th. That might work.

Alternatively, mix hard and soft hits. Since the snare uses X (hard) and x (soft), maybe O for hard toms. Let's go with that.

So inserting O on the last 16th of each beat. Let's test:

T: ---O|---O|---O|---O

That should add a tom hit on each beat's last 16th note. Let me check if that's not conflicting with other instruments. The ride has x---|X-x- etc., but on the last 16th of first beat, ride has -, so okay. Snare's last 16th in first beat is -, so no conflict. That should work. Alternatively, maybe vary it a bit, but simplest is to start with that. Let's go with that.
