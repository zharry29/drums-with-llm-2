Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. Let me start by understanding what they want. The user said, "I don't want any snare or ride." Alright, so I need to remove all the snare (S) and ride (R) parts from the given drum groove.

First, I'll look at the original groove provided:

@@@
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

My task is to eliminate the snare (S line) and the ride (R line). Let me go through each line step by step.

Starting with the Kick drum (K line): It has some hits, but since the user didn't mention removing kick, I leave it as is. 

Next, the Snare (S line): The user wants this removed entirely. So I'll replace the entire S line with all '-' characters to indicate no hits. 

The Hihat (H line) is already empty except for some dashes, so no changes there unless needed, but the user didn't mention hihat, so leave it.

Toms (T) and Crash (C) lines are also empty, so they stay the same.

Now the Ride (R line): Needs to be removed. Replace all characters in the R line with '-'.

Wait, let me double-check each line to ensure I'm not missing anything. The S line has entries like "Oo-o" and "O--o", which are snare hits. By setting all to '-', those are gone. Similarly, the R line has "o-O-" patterns, which are ride hits. Changing those to '-' removes the ride entirely.

Let me reconstruct the edited groove:

K remains:
K: O--O|----|--O-|----

S becomes all dashes:
S: ----|----|----|----

H stays the same:
H: ----|----|----|----

T and C are already empty:
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----

R becomes all dashes:
R: ----|----|----|----

Putting it all together between the @@@ markers. Let me make sure I didn't accidentally leave any S or R hits. Checking each line again. Yep, looks good. The user's request is met by removing snare and ride. No other changes needed. I think that's it.
