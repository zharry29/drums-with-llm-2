Okay, let me see. The user wants me to edit a drum groove so that it includes not only cymbals but also toms. The original groove provided is:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

First, I need to check which instruments are currently present. The Kick (K) has hits on the first and third beats. The Snare (S) is on beats 2 and 4. The Hihat (H) is closed hits (X) on every beat. The Toms (T) and Ride/Crash (R/C) are all dashes, meaning they're not played. The user's request is to add toms, since currently there are none, and they mentioned "not only cymbal but also tom"—so maybe they want to replace some cymbal parts with toms or add toms alongside existing cymbals? Wait, actually, in the original, there are no cymbals (C and R are all dashes). Wait, the user's edit request says "not only cymbal but also tom", but in the original, there are no cymbals. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake here? Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the original groove: The Hihat (H) is using X, which are closed hits, but that's part of the hihat, not a cymbal. The cymbals (C for crash, R for ride) are all dashes. So maybe the user intended to say that the groove currently has hihat but not cymbals (ride or crash) and toms, but the request is to add both cymbals and toms? Or maybe the user meant that the groove currently has hihat (which is a cymbal) but needs to also have toms? The wording says "not only cymbal but also tom"—so maybe the groove has cymbals (maybe hihat counts as a cymbal?), but they want toms added as well. Since the hihat is a closed hi-hat, which is part of the hi-hat instrument, but not a crash or ride cymbal. So perhaps the user wants to include a crash or ride cymbal in addition to adding toms.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and meant "not only hihat but also tom and cymbal". But given the exact wording, let's proceed as per the user's instruction. The task is to modify the groove to have not only cymbal (so adding cymbals if they aren't there) but also toms. Since currently, there are no cymbals (C and R are all dashes), so adding both cymbals and toms.

Wait, the original groove has H (hihat) with X, which are closed hits. The hihat is technically a cymbal, but maybe the user is considering "cymbal" as crash or ride. So perhaps the user wants to add crash or ride in addition to adding toms.

Alternatively, maybe the user's request is that the groove currently has hihat (which is a type of cymbal) but needs to also include toms. So the edit should add toms, keeping the existing hihat (which is a cymbal), so that it's not only cymbal (hihat) but also toms.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed by adding both crash/ride cymbals and toms. Let me see:

First, let's add some toms. The T line is all dashes. Let's choose a pattern for toms. Since the kick is on beats 1 and 3, maybe the toms can be on offbeats. For example, on the "&" of each beat. So in each beat, the 16th notes are positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (since each beat is divided into 4 16th notes). So for each beat, maybe on the second 16th note (the "&"), add a tom hit. Let's try:

T: -O--|O---|-O--|O--- (but need to check the pattern). Alternatively, a common tom pattern might be quarter notes or eighth notes. Since the kick is on beats 1 and 3, maybe the toms can be on 2 and 4. Let me think in terms of 4 beats per bar. Each beat has four 16th notes, so four beats make 16 notes.

Alternatively, for simplicity, let's put a tom on every other beat. Let me try to make a simple tom pattern. For example, on the second and fourth beats:

T: ----|O---|----|O--- but that might be too sparse. Alternatively, a steady eighth note pattern on toms. Since each beat has four 16th notes, an eighth note would be every two 16th notes. So for each beat, the first and third 16th notes are on the beat and "&", so maybe:

T: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O- but that's quarter notes. Alternatively, eighth notes: O---|---O|O---|---O etc. Maybe a pattern like O---|--O-|O---|--O- etc. Let me try to make a tom pattern that complements the kick and snare. Since kick is on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, maybe toms on the "&" of 1 and 3? For example, on the second 16th note of each beat:

So for each beat, the first 16th is -, second is O, then --. So T: -O--| -O--| -O--| -O-- across all four beats. But let's write it as:

T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O-- 

Wait, each beat is four characters. So each beat's T line would be "-O--", so the full line would be -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--. But maybe that's too busy with the snare. Alternatively, a tom fill on the offbeats where there's space. Alternatively, a tom on the third beat. Let me think of a common pattern. Alternatively, let's put toms on the third beat. Since the kick is on 1 and 3, maybe the tom on 3 would clash, so perhaps on 2 and 4. Alternatively, let's use a simple pattern like O--- on the second beat (since snare is there) might not be ideal. Alternatively, maybe a tom on the first 16th note of the second and fourth beats:

T: O---|----|O---|---- but not sure. Alternatively, toms on the "&" of each beat. Let's try:

For each beat, the 16th notes are 1, 2, 3, 4. Let's put a tom on the second 16th note (the "&") of each beat. So for each beat, it would be -O--. So over four beats:

T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O-- → but written as "-O--| -O--| -O--| -O--".

Alternatively, maybe a more sparse pattern, like on the second beat's first 16th and fourth beat's first. Not sure. Let's go with the first idea for now.

Now, adding cymbals. Since there are no cymbals except hihat, perhaps adding a ride cymbal. The user might want ride instead of crash. Let's put a steady ride pattern. For example, on every beat, maybe a closed hit (X or x on the bow) and some open hits. The given example in the notation has ride lines like "X-x-|X-x-" which is a common 8th note pattern. Let's use that for the ride.

So R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x- 

Alternatively, maybe alternate between O and X for some variation. But the user's edit request is to add cymbals, so adding ride (R) would suffice.

Putting it all together:

K remains the same: O---|----|O---|----

S also same: ----|O---|----|O---

H stays as X--- etc.

T would have the tom pattern I thought of, like -O-- on each beat:

T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--

But let me check the counts. Each beat is four 16ths. So for four beats, the T line would be "-O--|-O--|-O--|-O--".

Alternatively, maybe a different tom pattern. Let me see another approach. Maybe the toms play on the third beat's offbeats. Alternatively, let's try to make it fit better with the existing kick and snare. The kick is on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Maybe toms on the "&" of 2 and 4? Not sure. Alternatively, a tom on the third 16th of each beat? Hmm.

Alternatively, let's do a tom on the third beat's first 16th. Since the kick is on 3, maybe a tom on the "&" of 3? Not sure. Maybe it's better to go with a simple pattern like eighth notes on toms, so every two 16ths. So O---|---O|O---|---O etc. So for four beats:

T: O---|--O-|O---|--O- 

Wait, that would be:

First beat: O on first 16th, then three dashes.

Second beat: dash, O, then two dashes.

Wait, that would be O---| -O-- for the first two beats, but maybe better to alternate. Alternatively, T: O---|---O|O---|---O → which gives an eighth note pattern.

Alternatively, maybe a tom on every quarter note but offset from the kick. Since kick is on 1 and 3, maybe toms on 2 and 4. So T: ----|O---|----|O--- → but that's only on beats 2 and 4, which are the snare hits. Maybe that's okay. Let me try that.

Alternatively, let's do a tom on the third beat's "&", so third beat's second 16th. Let's try to make it simple. Maybe just putting a tom on the third beat's first 16th. Since the kick is on 1 and 3, maybe a tom on the 3's "&"? Not sure. Let me pick a pattern and go with it.

Alternatively, let's use the T line as follows: O---|O---|O---|O--- (all on the first 16th of each beat). But that would clash with the kick on 1 and 3. Hmm.

Alternatively, a tom on the second beat's first 16th and the fourth beat's first 16th. So T: ----|O---|----|O---. So on beats 2 and 4. That way, toms are on the same beats as the snare, but maybe that's okay. Let's try that.

So T: ----|O---|----|O---

Then for the cymbals, adding ride. Let's do R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x- as a steady eighth note pattern.

So the edited groove would be:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|O---|----|O---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

Wait, but the user's request was "not only cymbal but also tom". Since originally there were no toms and no cymbals (except hihat?), adding both would fulfill that. But in the original, H is present, which is a cymbal (hihat closed). So maybe the user wants to add another cymbal (like ride) and also toms. So the above should work.

Alternatively, maybe adding crash cymbals on certain hits. For example, a crash on the first beat. Let's add C: O---|----|----|---- so a crash on the first beat.

But the user's main request is to add both cymbals (probably ride) and toms. So the above should be okay. Let me check again.

Original had H (hihat) which is a cymbal. So the user might have meant "not only hihat but also toms and ride". So adding ride and toms would be correct.

So the final edited groove would have:

- Toms added on beats 2 and 4 (the snare beats), but maybe that's okay.

Alternatively, toms on offbeats. Let me try another pattern for toms. Let's say the toms play on the "&" of each beat (second 16th note). So each beat's T line is -O--. So over four beats:

T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--

This would create a steady eighth note tom pattern, which could add some groove.

Then the ride would be X-x-|X-x- etc. as before.

So combining:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--
C: ----|----|----|----
R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

This way, toms are on the "&" of each beat, ride is on the beat and "&", and hihat is closed on each beat. That might sound good.

Alternatively, maybe the toms should be softer, so using 'o' instead of 'O'? The Toms' articulation: O is hard, o is soft. Maybe using 'o' for a softer tom hit. Let me adjust that to o for a more subtle sound.

T: -o--|-o--|-o--|-o--

But the user's original T line was dashes, so adding any tom hits is okay. I think using O is fine unless it's too overpowering.

Alternatively, maybe alternate between O and o for variation. But perhaps keeping it simple is better.

So the final answer would be:
