Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any hihat or ride from the given groove. Let me first parse the original groove provided.

Looking at the original notation:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

So, breaking it down by instruments:

- **Kick (K):** All dashes, so no kick.
- **Snare (S):** Also all dashes, no snare.
- **Hihat (H):** Has some activity: in the second beat it's "x---", fourth beat "x---". The "x" here, according to the notation, is a soft closed hit (since H's X and x are hard and soft closed hits).
- **Toms (T):** All dashes, no toms.
- **Crash (C):** All dashes, no crash.
- **Ride (R):** The ride has a pattern: "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-". The "x" and "X" here correspond to soft and hard closed hits on the bow of the ride.

The user's request is to remove hihat and ride. That means we need to set all entries in the H and R lines to dashes. Let's go through each line:

1. **Kick (K):** Already empty, so no change.
2. **Snare (S):** Also empty, no change.
3. **Hihat (H):** Current entries are "----|x---|----|x---". To remove hihat, replace all non-dash characters with dashes. So the H line becomes "----|----|----|----".
4. **Toms (T):** Already empty, so no change.
5. **Crash (C):** Already empty, no change.
6. **Ride (R):** Current entries are "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-". Removing ride means replacing all these with dashes, resulting in "----|----|----|----".

After making these changes, the only instruments left would be whatever is in K, S, T, or C. But in this case, since K, S, T, and C are all empty, the entire groove would be silent except for possibly any other instruments, but according to the original, they're all off. Wait, but the user might not want that? Let me double-check the original. The original has hihat and ride, but no other instruments. So after removing those, the result is a completely silent bar. But maybe that's okay? The user's instruction was explicit: remove hihat and ride, so even if that leaves silence, that's the result.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again:

Original H line: "----|x---|----|x---" → becomes all dashes.

Original R line: "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-" → becomes all dashes.

Yes, so the final groove would have all lines as dashes except maybe others, but in this case, the rest are already empty. So the final output should be all dashes across all lines except maybe K, S, T, C. Since those are already empty, the entire bar is silent. That's technically correct based on the user's request, even if it's silent. Alternatively, maybe the user expects to keep other instruments if present, but in this case, there are none. So proceed accordingly.
