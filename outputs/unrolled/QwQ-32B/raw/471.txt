Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the snare and kick parts. Let me start by looking at the original groove provided.

First, the Kick (K) line is "O---|O---|----|O---". Since the user doesn't want any kick, I'll replace all the O's and dashes in the K line with dashes. So K becomes "----|----|----|----".

Next, the Snare (S) line is "----|----|O---|----". Removing the snare means changing those O's in the third beat to dashes. So S becomes "----|----|----|----".

The other lines: Hihat (H) is already empty except for the first beat, but since the user didn't mention hihat, I leave it as is unless told otherwise. Wait, actually, looking back, the original H line is "----|----|----|----", so no changes there. Toms (T) have some O-o- patterns. Since the user didn't mention toms, they stay. Crash (C) and Ride (R) are also empty, so no changes there either.

Wait, let me double-check the user's request. They said "I don't want any snare or kick." So only K and S lines need to be cleared. The rest stay as they are. The Toms line was "O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-", which the user didn't mention, so those stay. 

So the final groove should have K and S lines all dashes, and the rest remain. Let me put that into the notation.
