Okay, let's see. The user wants me to edit the given drum groove by removing any ride or hihat parts. Let me start by understanding the current groove structure.

Looking at the provided drum notation:

Kick (K): o---|--o-|o---|--o-
Snare (S): ----|X---|--X-|----
Hihat (H): ----|x---|----|x---
Toms (T): ----|----|----|----
Crash (C): ----|----|----|----
Ride (R): x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The user's request is to eliminate both the ride (R) and hihat (H) sections. So, I need to set all their entries to '-'.

First, check the Hihat line (H). It has 'x---' in the second beat and 'x---' in the fourth. Changing those to '----' across all beats.

Then the Ride (R) has 'x---', 'X-x-', 'x---', 'X-x-'. All those need to become '----|----|----|----'.

The other instruments (K, S, T, C) can stay as they are unless they're also part of the ride or hihat, but according to the problem, only those two are to be removed. Let me double-check that the user didn't mention other instruments. The request specifically says "no ride or hihat," so the rest should remain.

Wait, the snare has some X and x, which are sidestick hits, but those are part of the snare's allowed articulations, so those are okay to keep. The user didn't ask to remove snare, just ride and hihat.

So, after removing H and R, the new lines should be:

H: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Let me make sure there's no other instance of ride or hihat in other lines. The crash (C) is all dashes, so that's fine. The toms are also inactive here. 

Double-checking each line:

Kick remains: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
Snare remains: ----|X---|--X-|----
Hihat now all dashes.
Toms stay empty.
Crash stays empty.
Ride all dashes.

Yes, that should fulfill the request. I'll present the modified drum groove accordingly.
