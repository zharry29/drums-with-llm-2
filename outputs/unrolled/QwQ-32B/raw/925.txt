Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the cymbal on beat 4. First, I need to look at the given drum groove and identify which instruments are using cymbals. The crash cymbal (C) and ride cymbal (R) are the ones that typically handle cymbal hits.

Looking at the provided groove:

C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

So, the crash cymbal (C) has hits on every beat: the first three beats of each measure have an 'O' (hard hit), and the fourth beat also has an 'O' in the last measure. The ride cymbal (R) isn't active here except maybe in the last beat, but according to the given, it's all dashes except maybe the last part? Wait, the R line shows "----|----|----|----", so no hits at all. So the cymbal on beat 4 must be from the crash cymbal (C). 

The user's request is to remove the cymbal on beat 4. Since the crash is on beat 4 of the last measure (the fourth part of C's line is |O---), I need to replace that 'O' with a '-'. Let me check each part of the C line:

C's line is: O---|O---|O---|O---
Breaking it down into beats:
Beat 1: O---
Beat 2: O---
Beat 3: O---
Beat 4: O---

So, the fourth beat of the entire bar (the last | section) has an O. To remove the cymbal on beat 4, I should change that last O to a '-', making the C line: O---|O---|O---|----

Wait, but each beat is four 16th notes. The notation is per 16th note. Wait, the C line's fourth beat is the fourth part after the |, which is "O---". So the entire fourth beat (four 16th notes) for C is O---, meaning the first 16th note of beat 4 has an O, and the rest are silent. But the user says "no cymbal on beat 4", so perhaps they want all cymbal hits removed in the fourth beat. So changing all four characters in the fourth beat's C line from O--- to ----. 

Alternatively, maybe the user just wants the main hit on beat 4 gone. Since the first character of each beat is the first 16th note of that beat. So in beat 4, the first note is O, so changing that to '-' would remove the main crash on beat 4. The rest of the beat's notes are already '-', so the fourth beat for C becomes ----. 

Therefore, the edited C line would be O---|O---|O---|----

Other instruments: The user said "everything else is fine", so we leave K, S, H, T, and R as they are. 

Let me verify again:

Original C line: O---|O---|O---|O---
After edit: O---|O---|O---|----

Yes, that removes the crash on beat 4. The ride cymbal (R) wasn't active, so no changes there. The rest of the instruments remain the same. 

Putting it all together, the final groove should have the C line adjusted as above.
