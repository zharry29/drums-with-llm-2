Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants me to remove any cymbals or toms from the given drum groove. Let me first parse the original groove provided.

Looking at the given drum notation:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So, each line corresponds to a different drum part. The user specified removing cymbals (which include Crash (C) and Ride (R)) and toms (T). 

First, check each line:

- **Kick (K):** Already okay, no cymbals or toms here.
- **Snare (S):** Also okay, since snare isn't being removed. The edits here are just the snare hits.
- **Hihat (H):** Wait, the user didn't mention removing hihat. The request was "no cymbal or tom". Hihat is H, which is a closed hi-hat here (since it uses X and x). Since the user didn't mention hihat specifically, maybe it's allowed? Let me check the instruments again. The problem says "cymbal" includes crash and ride, but hihat is separate. The user might consider hihat as part of the kit but not a cymbal? Or maybe they want to remove all cymbals including hihat? Hmm, the instruction says "cymbal or tom". The hihat is technically a closed hi-hat hit, which is part of the hihat instrument. Since the user didn't mention hihat, perhaps we should keep it unless specified. Wait, the user's instruction says "I don't want any cymbal or tom", so maybe they want to remove all cymbals (including hihat?) or just crash/ride? Let me check the instrument list again.

Looking back at the instrument list:

- **H: Hihat** has O and o as open hits, X and x as closed hits. The user might consider hihat as a separate category, not a cymbal. Since the user mentioned "cymbal" (Crash and Ride), and Tom (T), then Hihat (H) is allowed unless specified. But maybe the user wants to remove all cymbals, including hihat? The problem is a bit ambiguous here. Let me check the previous examples the user provided. In prior interactions, when they said "no hihat" they set H to all dashes. But here the request is "no cymbal or tom". Since hihat is a different category, perhaps it's okay to leave it unless the user specifies. Wait, but the user might have a different understanding. Alternatively, maybe in their mind, hihat is a cymbal. To be safe, perhaps I should check the original problem's instrument list again.

The instruments are:

- K: Kick
- S: Snare
- H: Hihat
- T: Toms
- C: Crash cymbal
- R: Ride cymbal

So, "cymbal" here refers to Crash (C) and Ride (R). Hihat is its own category. Therefore, the user wants to remove C (crash) and R (ride), and T (toms), but H (hihat) is separate and allowed. Therefore, I should only set C and R to all dashes, and T to all dashes. The H line can stay as is.

Wait, but in the given groove, the T line is already all dashes, so that's okay. The C and R lines are already dashes. Wait, looking at the original provided groove:

Original given:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, in this case, T is already all dashes, so no toms. C and R are also already dashes. So the only parts that might need adjustment are if there's any cymbals or toms. But in this case, T is already empty, and C and R are empty. Therefore, the groove already meets the user's request. But that can't be right because the user is asking for an edit. Let me double-check the input again.

Wait, maybe I misread the input. Let me check again.

The user provided the drum groove as:

@@@
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

So in this case, Toms (T) are already not present. C and R are also not present. The only non-kick and snare parts are Hihat (H). Since the user's request is to remove cymbals (C, R) and toms (T), which are already removed, then the result would be the same as the input. But that's odd. Perhaps there's a mistake in the input? Or maybe the user made a typo, but I have to proceed as per given.

Alternatively, maybe the Hihat is considered a cymbal here, so the user wants to remove H as well. Since the user's instruction is ambiguous, but in the problem's instrument list, H is separate. Let me check the user's prior edits. For example, in previous interactions when the user said "I don't want any ride or hihat", they removed both R and H. But here, the request is "I don't want any cymbal or tom". Since H is not a cymbal, only C and R are cymbals, so H can stay. Therefore, the given groove already has no cymbals (C and R) and no toms (T), so the edited version would be the same as the original. But that's probably not the case. Maybe I made a mistake in reading the original input.

Wait, let me check again the user's current input:

The given drum groove is:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, so T, C, R are all dashes. So the only non-kick and snare is the Hihat. Therefore, the user's request is already satisfied. But perhaps they want to remove H as well? If so, then H should be set to all dashes. But according to the problem's instrument list, H is Hihat, which is a separate category. The user's instruction says "cymbal or tom", so H remains. Therefore, the correct edited groove is the same as the input. But maybe the user intended to remove hihat as well? To be safe, perhaps I should check the user's edit history. Looking back at prior interactions, when the user said "I don't want any kick or hihat", they removed K and H. So here, since the instruction is "cymbal or tom", which are separate from Hihat, the H should stay. Therefore, the final answer is the same as the input. But that feels redundant. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and meant to include hihat. Alternatively, maybe the Hihat is considered a cymbal here. Let me check the problem's description again.

In the drum notation explanation, H is Hihat, which includes closed hits (X/x) as well as open. The user's instruction is to remove cymbals (which are Crash and Ride) and toms. Since Hihat is a different instrument, it's okay. Therefore, the edited version remains the same as the input. But perhaps the user intended to remove H as well. Since the user might have a different understanding, but based on the given instrument list, I should follow strictly. So the answer would be the same as the input. However, looking at the user's previous examples, when they had to remove cymbals, they set C and R to dashes. Since this input already has those as dashes, the answer is the same. But maybe the user expects to see all cymbal lines set to dashes even if they were already there. So perhaps the final answer is the same as input. Let me confirm once again.

Yes, the original input already has C and R as dashes, T as dashes. So the edit request is already fulfilled. Hence, the output is the same as the input.
