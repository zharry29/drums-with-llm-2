Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the hihat on beat 4 but keep everything else the same. 

First, I need to look at the given drum groove. Let me parse each line. The H line is for the hihat. The current H line is:

H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

Each part separated by | is a beat. Since there are four beats in a bar, each | segment represents a beat. Each character in the four-character group corresponds to a 16th note. So, beat 4 is the last segment: |X-x-.

The user wants no hihat on beat 4. That means the fourth beat's characters should all be '-', since '-' means the instrument isn't played. So, I need to replace the last |X-x- with |----.

Let me check the other instruments to make sure they stay the same. The K, S, T, C, and R lines shouldn't change. 

Original lines:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

After editing the H line's last beat to all '-', the new H line becomes:

H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|----

Putting it all together, the final groove should have the H line modified only on the fourth beat. Let me double-check that no other parts are altered. Yep, looks good. The rest of the instruments remain as they were. That should fulfill the user's request.
