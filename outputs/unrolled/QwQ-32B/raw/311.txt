Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to include not only the snare but also a cymbal. Looking at the original groove provided:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

First, I notice that the snare (S) is already present, hitting on the second and fourth beats. The hihat (H) is active with closed hits (X) on every 16th note. However, the crash (C) and ride (R) cymbals are entirely inactive. The edit request specifies adding a cymbal, so I need to incorporate either crash or ride, or both.

Since the ride cymbal (R) is often used to provide a continuous rhythmic element, especially in grooves without a strong crash, I'll consider adding ride hits. Alternatively, adding crashes on the downbeats could add drama. Let me think about the style here. The kick (K) is on beats 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, and hihat is steady. This seems like a basic rock or funk groove. Adding ride could keep it flowing, while crashes might be more suitable for specific hits, like the first beat.

But the user says "not only snare but also cymbal," implying that the snare is already there, so we need to add cymbals. Since both crash and ride are options, maybe a combination. Let me check the previous examples. In prior responses, when adding ride, the assistant often used a steady pattern like -X-X|-X-X etc. But maybe here, since the groove is straightforward, a ride pattern that complements the snare and kick would work.

Looking at the snare hits on beats 2 and 4, perhaps the ride could play on the offbeats or a steady quarter notes. Alternatively, a crash on the first beat and ride on others? Let's try ride first. Let's make the ride play on every quarter note, using closed hits (X) for a steady pulse. That would be:

R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X

This way, the ride adds a consistent cymbal sound without clashing with the snare. Alternatively, using the bell (O) on the first beat and closed hits elsewhere? But the user might prefer a more active ride. Also, adding a crash on the first beat could be good. Let me see:

If I add a crash on the first beat of each measure (C: O---|----|O---|----), that would add a strong hit on 1. Combining that with ride might be too much, but maybe just ride alone is sufficient. Since the user didn't specify which cymbal, ride is a safe choice as it's more rhythmic.

Alternatively, maybe a combination of crash and ride. Let me check the original's snare and kick. The kick is on 1 and 3, so a crash on 1 would align with the kick. That could be effective. So:

C: O---|----|O---|----
R: ----|----|----|----

But then the user might prefer both. Alternatively, using ride on the offbeats. Let me think of a common pattern. Since the hihat is already on every 16th, maybe the ride can play on the & of each beat. For example:

R: -X--|-X--|-X--|-X--

But that might clash with the hihat. Alternatively, every quarter note. Let's go with the steady quarter notes on ride. So:

Final edit would add ride with a pattern like -X-X in each beat. Let me structure that properly.

The kick line is O---|----|O---|----, so each measure has four beats. For the ride, each beat's four 16th notes would be -X-X (since the first 16th is -, second X, third -, fourth X). That gives a quarter note pulse on the ride, which complements the snare and kick without overwhelming.

Therefore, the edited groove would have the ride active with -X-X in each beat segment. Also, since the user mentioned "not only snare but also cymbal," and snare is already there, adding ride fulfills that. Alternatively, adding crash on the first beat of each measure as well. Let me check if that's needed. Since the user just wants "cymbal," ride alone is sufficient. To keep it simple, I'll add the ride as described.

So the final answer would be:

@@@
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X

This adds a steady ride pattern, fulfilling the request.
