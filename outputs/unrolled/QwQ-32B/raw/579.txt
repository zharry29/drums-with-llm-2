Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. Let me start by understanding what they want. The user said, "I don't want any ride or cymbal." 

First, I should recall which lines correspond to which instruments. From the notation explanation, the lines are:

- K: Kick drum
- S: Snare drum
- H: Hihat
- T: Toms
- C: Crash cymbal
- R: Ride cymbal

The user wants to remove the ride (R) and any cymbals. The cymbals here include both Crash (C) and Ride (R). So, I need to set both the C and R lines to all '-' characters.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The R line is already all '-', so that's good. But the C line has an 'O---' in the first beat. I need to replace that with '----' to remove the crash cymbal.

So, the edited groove should have both C and R lines cleared. Let me double-check each line:

- K remains as is unless specified, since the user didn't mention kick.
- S is okay, since the request is about ride and cymbals.
- H is hihat, which isn't mentioned, so leave it.
- T toms are also unaffected.
- C needs to be all '-'.
- R is already clear.

So, the final edit should set the C line to all dashes. Let me write that out.
