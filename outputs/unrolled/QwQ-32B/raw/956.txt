Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a drum groove and wants to remove the hihat on beat 4. First, I need to understand the current setup.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The H line (Hihat) has "----|x---|----|x---". The user wants to eliminate the hihat on beat 4. Beat 4 is the last part after the last |, so the fourth beat here is "x---". To remove it, I should replace those x's with dashes. 

So the H line should become "----|x---|----|----".

I need to check if there's any other hihat on beat 4 that I might have missed. The original H line's fourth beat is "x---", so changing that to "----" will remove the hihat there. The rest of the elements (Kick, Snare, Toms, Crash, Ride) are supposed to stay the same, so I just need to ensure those lines remain unchanged.

Let me verify each line:

- K: remains the same.
- S: stays as is.
- H: modify the fourth beat to "----".
- T, C, R: no changes.

That should fulfill the user's request. Let me write the final version accordingly.
