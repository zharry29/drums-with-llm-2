Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a specific drum notation and wants me to remove any elements involving toms or snare. Let me start by understanding the given groove first.

Looking at the original groove:

**K (Kick drum):** O--O|----|--O-|----  
This has some kicks on the first and third beats of the first and third parts.  
**S (Snare drum):** ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o  
The snare has hits in the second, third, and fourth beats with various articulations like Oo and o.  
**H (Hihat):** X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-  
Closed and open hi-hat hits throughout.  
**T (Toms):** All dashes, so no toms here.  
**C (Crash cymbal):** All dashes.  
**R (Ride cymbal):** All dashes.  

The user's request is to remove tom and snare. Since there are no toms already, I just need to eliminate the snare part. Let me check each line:

- **Kick (K):** Keep as is because it's allowed.  
- **Snare (S):** Replace all characters with dashes to remove all snare hits.  
- **Hihat (H):** Leave it since it's not mentioned to be removed.  
- **Toms (T):** Already empty.  
- **Crash (C) and Ride (R):** Also empty, so no changes there.  

Wait, the user said "no tom or snare," so confirming that hihat is okay. The edited groove should only have kick and hihat remaining. Let me reconstruct each line accordingly.

Double-checking the notation rules to ensure I'm not missing anything. The snare line must be all dashes now. The hihat's X and x are allowed as they're not part of the excluded instruments. The kick remains untouched. Alright, that should do it.
