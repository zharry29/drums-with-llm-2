Alright, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the ride on beat 4, but keep everything else the same. First, I need to look at the original groove provided.

Looking at the R: line (Ride cymbal), the current pattern is "----|----|----|----". Wait, actually, in the given groove, the Ride line is already all dashes. That means there's no ride playing at all. The user might have made a mistake in their request because there's no ride on any beat here. But maybe I should double-check each line to be sure.

Let me go through each instrument line again:

- **K (Kick):** Has hits on various beats.
- **S (Snare):** Only on the third segment with "S---".
- **H (Hihat):** Closed hits on all beats.
- **T (Toms):** A hit in the third beat's last segment.
- **C (Crash):** Hits on all four beats.
- **R (Ride):** All dashes, so no ride cymbal is being used.

Since the Ride line is already empty, removing the ride on beat 4 doesn't change anything. But perhaps the user intended to refer to another instrument? Maybe they meant the Crash? Let me check the edit requests from previous interactions. Oh, in some previous cases, users sometimes confused Crash and Ride. Alternatively, maybe there was a typo in the input.

Wait, the user's instruction specifically says "I don't want ride on beat 4". Since Ride isn't active here, the correct response is to confirm that Ride wasn't present, but since I must follow the instruction as given, perhaps the user expects to see no changes. However, the system might expect me to proceed as if there was a ride on beat 4. Let me check the original input again to ensure I didn't misread.

Looking again at the provided drum groove:

R: line is "----|----|----|----". So indeed, no Ride. Therefore, the edit request doesn't require any changes. But the user might have intended to target another part. Alternatively, maybe the user's previous edits had a different setup, but in this specific case, the Ride isn't present. 

Since the user's instruction is clear, even if redundant, I should output the same groove but ensure that Ride remains without beat 4. Since it's already absent, the final answer will be identical to the original, but formatted correctly. I'll proceed to present the groove as is, between the @@@ markers.
