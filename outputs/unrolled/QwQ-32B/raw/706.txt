Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a cymbal hit and hihat in the very beginning. 

First, looking at the original groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user mentioned adding a cymbal hit and hihat at the start. The very beginning is the first 16th note of the first beat (the first character in the first segment before the |). 

For the cymbal, since the crash (C) is already present but not used, and the ride (R) is also an option. The user might prefer crash for a louder hit, so I'll add an 'O' on the crash in the first position.

For the hihat, the original has no hihat hits. The H line uses 'x' for closed hits. To start with a hihat, I'll add an 'x' in the first position. 

So modifying the first beat of K, C, and H:

K remains O--- since the kick is already there. But wait, the user might want the kick to stay. So keep the kick's 'O' and add the cymbal and hihat. 

Thus, the new lines would be:

C: O---|.... (adding O at first)
H: x---|.... (adding x at first)

Check if that's within the notation rules. Each line starts with the first 16th note. 

Final adjustments: Ensure other parts remain the same. So the edited groove should have the first beat of C as O--- and H as x---. 

Double-checking: The user wanted both a cymbal (probably crash here) and hihat at the very beginning. This should fulfill the request without conflicting with existing hits.
