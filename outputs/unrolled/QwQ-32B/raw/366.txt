Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a specific drum notation and wants me to remove any cymbals or ride elements. Let me first parse the given groove to understand what needs to be changed.

Looking at the original groove:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

Breaking this down by instrument:

- **Kick (K):** No hits, all dashes.
- **Snare (S):** Also no hits.
- **Hihat (H):** Has some activity on the second and fourth beats with 'x' which, according to the notation, are soft closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** Silent.
- **Crash (C):** Silent.
- **Ride (R):** The ride has a pattern here: 'x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-'. The 'x' and 'X' denote closed hits on the bow, which are part of the ride cymbal. Since the user wants no cymbals or ride, this line needs to be cleared.

The user's request is to remove cymbals and ride. The ride (R) is a cymbal, so that entire line should be dashes. The crash (C) is already silent, so that's okay. The hihat (H) is not a cymbal, right? Wait, the hihat is a separate instrument. Let me confirm the instruments:

From the problem statement:
- **H:** Hihat (not a cymbal, though sometimes categorized differently, but in the given notation, it's listed separately from C and R).
- **C:** Crash cymbal
- **R:** Ride cymbal

Therefore, the user wants to remove Crash (C) and Ride (R). The hihat (H) is allowed as it's not a cymbal in this context. Wait, actually, hihats are typically considered part of the cymbal family, but according to the problem's instrument list, they are separate. Let me check the user's exact request again: "I don't want any cymbal or ride." Since the hihat is listed under its own line, maybe the user considers it separate. The instruction says "cymbal or ride," and since ride is a cymbal, but hihat might be okay. However, sometimes hihats are considered part of cymbals. But according to the given notation, they are separate instruments (H, C, R). The user probably means to remove Crash (C) and Ride (R), leaving Hihat (H) as it's a different instrument.

But wait, the user might consider hihat as part of the cymbals. Need to be precise. The problem statement's instrument list clearly separates H (hihat), C (crash), and R (ride). So "cymbal or ride" would mean remove both C and R. Hihat is separate. So in the given groove, the ride (R) has hits, which must be removed. The crash (C) is already silent. The hihat (H) can stay as it's not a cymbal in this context. 

So the edited groove should have R's line set to all dashes, and leave H as is. Let me confirm the user's example edits from previous interactions. For instance, in a prior case where the user said "I don't want any hihat or tom," the assistant removed H and T lines. Similarly, here, removing R and C. 

Therefore, the corrected groove would be:

K remains the same (all dashes)
S remains the same (all dashes)
H stays as is (since it's not a cymbal)
T stays (no change)
C becomes all dashes (already is)
R becomes all dashes.

So the final notation would be:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
