Alright, let's tackle this edit request. The user wants a "jazzy" bass guitar comp on each quarter note downbeat. First, I need to recall that in jazz, comping often involves syncopation, walking bass lines, or chordal hits. Since the user specified "on each quarter note downbeat," I should focus on the first beat of each measure.

Looking at the provided drum groove, the kick (K) is completely silent. To add the bass comp, I'll use the kick drum to represent the bass hits because there's no separate line for bass in the notation. That makes sense since the kick can mimic the bass's role here.

Each bar has four beats, so the downbeats are the first 16th note of each beat. To mark each quarter note downbeat (which is every two beats), I need to hit the kick on the first 16th note of beats 1 and 3 in each bar. Wait, actually, a quarter note is two 16th notes, so maybe every two beats? Let me think again. A quarter note is one beat, so in a 4/4 measure, the downbeats are beats 1, 2, 3, 4. Each beat is four 16th notes. So the first 16th note of each beat would be the downbeat of that beat. But the user said "quarter note downbeat," so maybe they mean the main beats 1 and 3? Or all four? Hmm, maybe better to hit the kick on the first 16th note of each beat (every quarter note division). But to make it jazzy, perhaps syncopation? Wait, the user says "on each quarter note downbeat," so strictly on beats 1, 2, 3, 4 of each measure.

Wait, each bar is four beats. So in each bar, the downbeats are the first 16th note of each beat. To comp on each quarter note downbeat, that would be every beat's first 16th note. So in each bar, four hits on the kick. But maybe the user wants it only on the main downbeats (beats 1 and 3)? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the example responses from previous interactions. In previous edits when adding low frequencies, they added kicks on every beat or in a pattern. Since the user specified "quarter note downbeat," which in 4/4 time would be beats 1, 2, 3, 4. So each beat's first 16th note. Therefore, adding a kick on the first 16th note of each beat (every four characters in the K line). Let's see the original K line is all dashes. So replacing each first 16th note of each beat with a hit. 

But jazz comping isn't just steady. Maybe a more syncopated pattern? Wait, the user says "on each quarter note downbeat," so maybe it's strict. Let me go with that. So for each beat, the first 16th note (position 1, 5, 9, 13) would have an O (hard hit). So K: O---|O---|O---|O---. But looking at the previous examples, when adding low frequencies, they used O--- for each beat. Let me confirm with the user's request again. They want it "in a jazzy way." Maybe using some syncopation or off-beats? Alternatively, a walking bass line pattern. Since we can't use the bass line notation, using the kick to imply that. 

Alternatively, perhaps a pattern like O---|--O-|O---|--O- to add some variation. But the user says "on each quarter note downbeat," so maybe the first note of each beat. Let me stick to that. So K: O---|O---|O---|O---. But in the original groove, the ride (R) has a pattern that might clash. Alternatively, maybe soft hits (o) to keep it subtle. Let me check the previous edits. In prior responses when adding low frequencies, they used O--- on the kick for each beat. So maybe that's the way to go. 

Thus, the edited K line would be O--- repeated four times. Let me check the original Hihat is on x--- etc., so keeping that, and adding kick on each downbeat. That should fulfill the request. Let me write that out.
