Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the hihat and ride cymbal parts from the given groove. Let me first look at the original drum notation they provided.

The original groove is:

@@@
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

Wait, the user mentioned removing hihat (H) and ride (R). Looking at the current setup, the H line is already all dashes, so there's no hihat to remove. The R line is also all dashes. Hmm, maybe there was a mistake here. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the user's input again. The given groove's H line is all dashes, so no hihat is present. Similarly, the R line is also dashes. The user wants to remove hihat and ride, but they aren't present. Maybe there's a typo, but perhaps the user is referring to another part? Alternatively, maybe they meant to remove crash cymbal (C) instead of ride? Let me check the edit request again.

The user's exact request was: "I don't want any hihat or ride." Since H and R are already inactive, maybe the crash (C) is the only cymbal part here. But the user didn't mention crash. Alternatively, perhaps there was a mistake in the initial input. Let me confirm the original groove again.

Looking again at the given groove:

C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
That's crash cymbal hitting every beat. Since the user wants to remove hihat (already gone) and ride (also gone), but maybe they actually wanted to remove crash instead? Or maybe they just want to ensure that H and R are cleared. Since H and R are already clear, the only change needed is perhaps to make sure those lines stay as dashes. But the user might have intended to remove crash as well. Wait, the edit request is clear: remove hihat and ride. Since those are already gone, the answer would just be the same as the original, but maybe the user intended to remove crash? Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in reading the original.

Wait, looking at the user's provided groove again:

In the H line: H: ----|----|----|---- so no hihat. The R line is also all dashes. So the only cymbal part is the crash (C). The user didn't mention crash, so perhaps the edit is just confirming that H and R are already removed, so the answer remains the same. But maybe the user wants to make sure that those are explicitly set to nothing. Alternatively, maybe there was a mistake in the input, and the user intended to have some hihat or ride in the original, but in the provided example, they aren't there. 

In any case, following the instructions strictly: remove hihat (H) and ride (R). Since they are already dashes, the resulting groove would be the same as the original except perhaps ensuring those lines are clear. But since they are already clear, the final answer would be the same as the original. Wait, but maybe the user's edit request is redundant here. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's input had a typo, and the original H or R had some notes. Let me check the exact user input again:

The user's given drum groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, H and R are already inactive. So the edit request doesn't change anything except perhaps ensuring that those lines remain as dashes. Therefore, the edited groove would be identical to the original. But maybe the user wants to remove crash as well? But the request didn't mention that. So I should proceed as per the given instructions, only removing H and R which are already gone. Therefore, the final answer is the same as the original.
