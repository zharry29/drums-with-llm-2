Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the ride cymbal on beat 4, but keep everything else the same. 

First, I need to look at the original groove provided. Let me parse each line:

**Original Groove:**
```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

So, the ride (R) is playing on all four beats. Specifically, beat 4 of the ride is "X-x-". The user wants to eliminate the ride on beat 4. 

Breaking down the R line:
- Beat 1: x---
- Beat 2: X-x-
- Beat 3: x---
- Beat 4: X-x-

The request is to remove the ride on beat 4. That means changing the fourth beat's characters to all '-' since they don't want any ride hits there. 

Looking at the R line's fourth beat: "X-x-" has hits on the first and third 16th notes. To remove them, replace each non '-' character with '-'. So "X-x-" becomes "----".

The rest of the groove remains unchanged. Let me double-check the other instruments to ensure nothing else is touched. 

Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), and Crash (C) all have no changes needed. Only the Ride (R) on beat 4 needs to be silenced.

Final check: After editing, the R line should be:
```
R: x---|X-x-|x---|----
```

Yes, that looks right. No other parts are altered. The user's instruction was straightforward, so I think this should work.
