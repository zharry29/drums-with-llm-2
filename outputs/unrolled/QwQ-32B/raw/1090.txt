Okay, I need to convert the given drum groove into a metal-style groove. Let me start by recalling what makes a metal groove. Metal typically uses heavy, powerful hits, often with a strong emphasis on the kick drum and snare, and a busy, syncopated hihat pattern. The groove should feel aggressive and driving.

Looking at the original groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

First, the kick (K) is using soft hits (o), but in metal, harder hits (O) are more common. So I'll replace the 'o's with 'O's. The current kick pattern is on the first 16th note of each beat. Maybe adding more hits or offbeats would make it more intense. Let's see: maybe a double-time pattern like O-O- repeated could add drive.

The snare (S) has sidestick hits (X and x) on the second beat. Metal often uses harder snare hits. Replacing X with O and maybe adding more snare hits on backbeats. The current snare is sparse, so adding hits on beats 2 and 4 with harder strikes would help.

The hihat (H) is only on the second and fourth beats. Metal grooves usually have continuous hihat, maybe alternating closed and open hits. The original has 'x---' and '----', so making it more active. Using a pattern like X-x- or X-x-x- to create a busier feel.

The ride (R) has a pattern, but in metal, ride is less common; crash (C) might be used for accents. Maybe replacing some ride hits with crash or focusing more on hihat. Alternatively, using the ride's closed hits (X/x) for a harsher sound.

Let me adjust each line step by step.

Kick (K): Replace soft 'o's with hard 'O's. The original is o---|--o-|o---|--o-. Changing to O---|---O|O---|---O might not add much. Maybe a more active pattern like O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O- to get a double-time kick, which is common in metal. That would make each beat have two hits on the first and third 16th notes.

Snare (S): The original has X on second beat. Let's make it a hard hit on beat 2 and 4. Maybe O on the second 16th of beat 2 and similar. For example: On the second beat, instead of X---, maybe O on the second 16th note. Also adding a hit on beat 4. So S: ----|O---|----|O--- might work, but to make it more aggressive, maybe O on the third 16th of each beat? Or a syncopated pattern like -O--|... Hmm, need to think of typical metal snare placement. Maybe on the 2nd and 4th beats with harder hits. Let's try S: ----|O---|--O-|---- but maybe with more density.

Hihat (H): The original has x on the second and fourth beats. To make it varied and busier, use a pattern like X-x- repeated. So each beat has X on first, x on third, and the rest '-', so X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-. That gives a continuous closed and open hits, which is typical for metal.

Crash (C): The original has none. Adding a crash on the first beat might add intensity. So C: O---|----|----|----

Ride (R): The original has a pattern, but in metal, ride might not be as prominent. Maybe remove ride and focus on crash and hihat. So set R to all '-'.

Putting it all together:

K: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O-
S: ----|O---|--O-|----
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, let me check the original's snare. The original S line was: ----|X---|--X-|----. The user's edit request is to make it more metal, so maybe adding more snare hits. Let me think again. Maybe the snare could have hits on beats 2 and 4 with some ghost notes. Alternatively, a more complex pattern. Let me adjust S to have O on the third 16th of each beat for a typical backbeat. Alternatively, syncopated hits. Maybe S: -O--|O---|-O--|O--- but need to check the original's structure.

Alternatively, since the original has X on the second beat's first 16th, replacing with harder hits and adding more. Let's try:

S: -o-o|O---|-o-O-|---- or something else. Hmm, perhaps making the snare hits harder and more frequent. Let me try:

S: -O--|O---|-O--|O--- but need to fit into the 4 beats. Each beat has four 16th notes. Let me see:

Beat 1: ---- (no snare)
Beat 2: O---
Beat 3: --O-
Beat 4: ----

Wait, original S has X on beat 2 first 16th and beat 3 second 16th. Maybe changing to O on beat 2's second 16th and beat 4's second 16th. So:

S: ----| -O-- | ---- | -O-- but that might be sparse. Alternatively, adding more. Maybe S: -O--|O---|-O--|O--- but not sure. Alternatively, a constant eighth note snare with O. Hmm, perhaps better to have snare on beats 2 and 4 with harder hits, maybe O on the second 16th of each beat. So:

S: ----|O---|----|O--- but that's every other beat. Maybe adding a ghost note before. Like -O--|O---|-O--|O--- but each beat is four notes. Let me think of a typical metal snare pattern. Maybe a double bass with snare on 2 and 4. Alternatively, using the snare more. Alternatively, let's make the snare have a hit on the third 16th of each beat, like -O-- repeated. So S: -O--| -O-- | -O-- | -O-- but that might be too much. Alternatively, on beats 2 and 4, harder hits. Let me go with S: ----|O---|--O-|----

Wait, perhaps better to make the snare hits more aggressive. Let me try:

K: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O-
S: -o-o|O---|-o-o|O---
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This way, the kick is constant eighth notes, snare has some ghost notes and harder hits on beats 2 and 4, hihat is busy, and crash on first beat. That should sound more metal. Let me check if the counts add up. Each line should have 16 characters (4 beats * 4 notes). Let's verify each line:

K: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O- → 4*4=16
S: -o-o|O---|-o-o|O--- → Each beat: first "-o-o", second "O---", third "-o-o", fourth "O---". Total 4*4=16.
H: X-x- repeated four times → 16
C: O--- four times → 16
R: all ---- → 16

Yes, that works. The snare has some variation with the -o-o parts, which might be ghost notes, and the O on the second and fourth beats. The kick is a constant eighth, which is common in metal. Hihat is active. Crash on first beat adds a hit. This should meet the metal requirement.
