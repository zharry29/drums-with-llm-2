Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants to make the drum groove have more low-frequency sounds. The original groove has a kick drum (K) and crashes (C), but maybe they want even more emphasis on the lower end. Let's look at the given groove first:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

Hmm, the kick is already active, but the crashes might be adding some higher frequencies. To increase low frequencies, I should probably reduce the crashes and add more kick or toms. Since the user mentioned "more low frequency," maybe replacing some crash hits with toms (T) which are lower than crashes. Also, the kick could be reinforced by adding more hits or using harder hits. Let me see:

First, the crashes (C) are hitting every beat. Let's try removing some of those. Maybe replace the crash hits with toms. Since Toms (T) are lower, replacing C's O with T's O would add more low-end. Let's also check the kick. The kick is already quite active, but maybe making some hits harder (they're already O, which is the hardest). Alternatively, adding more kick hits where there are rests. 

Looking at the first bar of K: OOO-|--O-|... The first beat has three consecutive Os (since it's OOO-), but the second beat has --O- which is a rest on the first three 16th notes and a hit on the fourth. Maybe adding a tom hit on the downbeats where there's a crash to replace the crash. 

Let me try modifying the Crash line (C) to have fewer hits. Let's set C to all ---- since they might be too high. Then, take those crash hits and put them into Toms. For example, where there was a crash on the first beat, add a tom hit there. 

Original C line: O---|O---|O---|O--- (each beat has a crash on the first 16th note). So for each of the four beats, the first 16th note is a crash. Let's replace those with toms. So T would have O---|O---|O---|O--- on each beat. 

But maybe even harder? Since O is already the hardest hit. Alternatively, adding more tom hits in between. Also, check the kick pattern. The kick is already busy, but maybe syncopating it with toms could help. 

Alternatively, the user might want more kick. Let me see. The original K has OOO- on the first beat, which is three hits in the first beat (since each beat is four 16th notes). Then --O- on the second beat. Maybe adding more kick hits on the offbeats. But maybe the key is to remove the crashes and add toms. 

So modifying C to all ----, and T to have O on each beat's first 16th note. Let me draft that:

K remains as is? Or maybe add more kick. Alternatively, combine with toms. Let me try:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: O---|O---|O---|O---  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

This replaces the crashes with toms on the downbeats. That should add more low-end. Also, maybe adding some tom hits on other parts. Alternatively, making the tom hits harder. Since T uses O for hard hits, that's fine. 

Wait, the user's original T line was all ----, so adding toms where crashes were is a good start. Alternatively, maybe also adding some more tom hits in other positions to reinforce the kick. For instance, on the third 16th note of each beat or something. But maybe starting with replacing the crashes is sufficient. 

Another thought: the kick has some spaces, like the first bar's first beat has three Os, but the second beat starts with two rests. Maybe adding a tom there as well. But perhaps the main change is moving crashes to toms. 

Alternatively, the user might want more kick activity. Let me check the original kick: 

First beat: O O O - (three hits on first three 16ths)
Second beat: - - O - (hit on the third 16th)
Third beat: O O O -
Fourth beat: - O O O (hits on the second, third, fourth 16ths)

So the kick is already quite active. Maybe adding toms on the offbeats where there are rests. For example, in the first beat, after the three Os, maybe a tom on the fourth 16th. But that's a minor point. 

Alternatively, maybe adding some tom hits in between the kick hits to fill in the low end. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the toms to have more hits. Let me go with replacing crashes with toms first. 

So the final version would have T: O---|O---|O---|O--- and C: all dashes. That should reduce high frequencies and add more lows. 

Wait, but in the original, the crash is on every beat's first 16th. So replacing that with toms on the same spots. 

Alternatively, maybe adding a tom on every beat's first 16th and some others. 

Alternatively, making the tom pattern more active. Let me see. 

Alternatively, the user might want the toms to have a pattern similar to the kick but offset. 

Hmm, perhaps that's sufficient. Let me present that as the edited version.
