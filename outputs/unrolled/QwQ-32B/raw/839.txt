Okay, let me tackle this edit request. The user wants a kick hit and cymbal in the very beginning of the given drum groove. 

First, I need to look at the existing groove. The current K (kick) line starts with "-O--", which means the first 16th note is silent, then a hard hit on the second. To add a kick hit at the very beginning, I should change that first '-' to an 'O' or 'o'. Since the user didn't specify soft or hard, I'll go with a hard hit 'O' for a strong start.

Next, the cymbal part. The user mentioned "cymbal", but there are two cymbals here: Crash (C) and Ride (R). Looking at the existing C line, it's "O---|O---|O---|O---", so crashes are already on the first note of each beat. But the very first note of the entire bar is a crash. However, the user might want an additional cymbal hit at the very beginning. Alternatively, maybe they want a ride hit instead or in addition. Since the original R line is all dashes, adding a ride hit there might be better for variety. 

Wait, the user said "cymbal" generally. The crash is already there on the first beat, but maybe they want the ride to start as well. Let me check the original request again. The user said "a kick hit and cymbal in the very beginning". Since the crash is already present on beat 1, maybe adding a ride hit on the first 16th note would complement it. Alternatively, maybe they want the ride to start instead of the crash. Hmm.

Looking at the existing C line, it has crashes on every first 16th note of each beat. The first note of the bar is an O on crash. The user might want to replace that with a ride, or add a ride. But since the user said "cymbal", perhaps adding a ride hit on the first note. Let me see. The original R line is all dashes, so adding an 'O' on the first 16th note of the ride would introduce a ride bell hit there. That could work.

So, modifying the K line's first character to 'O', making it "O---|..." instead of "-O--|...". Then, for the cymbal, adding an 'O' on the ride's first note. The crash is already there, so maybe that's okay. Alternatively, if the user prefers only one cymbal, maybe replace the crash with ride? But the user said "cymbal", so including both might be okay. Let me proceed with adding a ride hit at the start.

Therefore, the new K line starts with "O---", and the R line starts with "O---" instead of "----". That should fulfill the request of a kick and cymbal (ride) at the very beginning. Let me double-check the notation rules. For the ride, 'O' is a hard bell hit, which is appropriate. The kick's first note is now a hard hit. That should do it.
