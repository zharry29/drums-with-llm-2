Okay, so the user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing any snare or ride elements. Let me start by understanding the given drum notation and the specific instruments involved.

First, looking at the provided drum groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
S: ----|X---|--X-|----  
H: ----|x---|----|x---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The user's request is to remove snare (S) and ride (R). So I need to set all the S and R lines to all dashes ('-').

Let me check each line:

- **Kick (K):** This is okay, no changes needed since it's not related to snare or ride.
- **Snare (S):** Currently has some X and x hits. I'll replace all characters in this line with '-'.
- **Hihat (H):** This has some x hits. Since the user didn't mention hihat, it stays as is.
- **Toms (T):** All dashes, so no change.
- **Crash (C):** Also all dashes, so no change.
- **Ride (R):** This has x and X characters. Replace all with '-'.

Wait, the user didn't mention hihat or crash, so those should stay unless specified. The request is specifically about snare and ride. So I'll only modify S and R lines.

Let me reconstruct each line step by step:

**Kick (K):**
Original: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
No changes, so remains the same.

**Snare (S):**
Original: ----|X---|--X-|----
Change all to dashes: ----|----|----|----

**Hihat (H):**
Original: ----|x---|----|x---
No change, so stays as is.

**Toms (T):**
All dashes, no change.

**Crash (C):**
All dashes, no change.

**Ride (R):**
Original: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
Change all to dashes: ----|----|----|----

Putting it all together, the edited drum groove should look like this:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
S: ----|----|----|----  
H: ----|x---|----|x---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

I need to ensure that the structure of each line (four characters per beat, separated by |) is maintained. Let me double-check each line's length and separators.

Yes, each line has 16 characters (including the | separators). The S and R lines now have all dashes where they previously had notes. The other lines remain unchanged except for the specified instruments. That should fulfill the user's request.
