Okay, let's tackle this edit request. The user provided a drum groove and wants to remove the hihat and kick parts. Let me start by understanding the current groove structure.

First, I'll look at each line in the given drum notation. The K line (Kick drum) has some hits like O--O and --O-, so I need to clear all those out. The H line (Hihat) is already empty except for some dashes, but maybe there are some notes I missed. Wait, in the given groove, the H line is all dashes, so maybe it's already clear. But the user still says to remove hihat, so I should double-check.

The user's request is to remove both hihat and kick. So, I need to set all characters in the K and H lines to '-'.

Looking at the S (Snare), T (Toms), C (Crash), and R (Ride) lines, they should stay as they are unless they have hihat or kick elements, but those are separate lines. Let me go through each line one by one.

Original K line: "O--O|----|--O-|----" → becomes "----|----|----|----"
Original H line: "----|----|----|----" → stays the same, but maybe the user wants to ensure it's clear, so same as before.
S line: "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o" → remains unchanged.
T line is already all dashes.
C line is dashes.
R line: "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-" → stays unless part of hihat or kick, which it isn't.

Wait, the user might have a typo, but according to the request, only remove hihat and kick. So, the final should have K and H lines all dashes. Let me confirm each part again.

Yes, that's correct. So replacing all K's hits with '-', and H is already clear. The rest stay. Let me write that out.
