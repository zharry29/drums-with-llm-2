Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to have not only ride but also hihat. Looking at the original groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

So, the kick and snare are completely silent. The hihat is only on the second and fourth beats, specifically on the first 16th note of those beats (x--- and x---). The ride has a pattern of x--- | X-x- | x--- | X-x-, which is a steady eighth-note pattern with some accents.

The request is to include hihat in addition to the ride. Since the hihat is already present but sparse, maybe we can add more hihat hits to complement the ride. The existing hihat is closed hits (x) on beats 2 and 4. To add more, perhaps we can have a steady closed hihat on all eighth notes, which would match the ride's rhythm. That way, both hihat and ride are active but playing off each other.

Alternatively, maybe layering some open hihat (O or o) on certain hits for variation. But the main goal is to ensure hihat is more present alongside the ride. Let me check the notation rules again. For hihat, X and x are closed hits (hard and soft), while O and o are open. Since the original uses x, maybe continuing with closed hits but making them more consistent.

Let me try making the hihat play every eighth note (so two hits per beat), using x for a steady closed hihat. That would mean each beat in H would be xx-- or x-x-? Wait, each beat is four 16th notes. Eighth notes are two 16th notes. So for a steady eighth, every two 16th notes: xx-- | xx-- etc. But the ride is x--- | X-x- which is every beat's first and third 16th? Wait, the ride's first beat is x---, which is only the first 16th. Hmm, maybe the ride is on the downbeats and the '+' of the beat? Let me parse the ride line:

R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
Breaking down each beat (four 16th notes):
Beat 1: x - - - (first 16th)
Beat 2: X - x - (first and third 16th)
Beat 3: same as beat 1
Beat 4: same as beat 2

So the ride has a pattern of hitting on the first 16th of each beat, plus an extra hit on the third 16th of beats 2 and 4. To make hihat complement this, perhaps have the hihat on all the eighth notes (every two 16th notes). That would be x-x- for each beat. Wait, but that would be every other 16th note. Let's see:

If I set H to x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-, that would give a steady eighth note closed hihat. That should work, adding more hihat while the ride has its own pattern. The original hihat was only on the first 16th of beats 2 and 4, so expanding it to all eighth notes would definitely add more hihat presence. Let me check if that's allowed. The user wants "not only ride but also hihat", so as long as hihat is more than just two hits, this should be okay.

Alternatively, maybe add some open hihats on the snare hits, but there are no snares here. Since the kick is also silent, maybe keeping it simple with steady closed hihat. Let me write that out:

H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-

That way, the hihat is active throughout, matching the ride's eighth-note feel but providing a different texture. The ride has accents (X) on beats 2 and 4's first 16th and third, while the hihat is steady. This should fulfill the request.
