Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the entire groove to have no more than 8 notes. First, I need to count the current number of notes in the given groove.

Looking at each instrument line:

**Kick (K):** "O--O|----|--O-|----"  
Breaking it down beat by beat (each | separates 4 notes):
- Beat 1: O, -, -, O → 2 notes
- Beat 2: -, -, -, - → 0
- Beat 3: -, O, -, - → 1
- Beat 4: -, -, -, - → 0  
Total for K: 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3 notes

**Snare (S):** "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o"  
- Beat 1: -, -, -, - → 0
- Beat 2: O, o, -, o → 3 (since O and o are both hits)
- Beat 3: -, o, -, - → 1
- Beat 4: O, -, -, o → 2  
Total for S: 0 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 notes

**Hihat (H):** "X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-"  
Each beat has X, -, x, - → 2 notes per beat.  
4 beats × 2 = 8 notes

**Toms (T), Crash (C), Ride (R):** All are "----|----|----|----", so 0 notes each.

Total notes so far: 3 (K) + 6 (S) + 8 (H) = 17 notes. That's way over the limit. Need to reduce to ≤8.

The user wants to minimize notes, so we need to eliminate most of them. Let's prioritize keeping the essential parts (like kick and snare) and cut the hihat which has the most notes.

First, the hihat has 8 notes. To reduce, maybe set it to all dashes. That cuts 8 notes immediately.

Now remaining notes: 3 + 6 = 9. Still need to reduce by 1 more.

Looking at the snare: it has 6 notes. Maybe reduce some of its hits. For example, the last beat's "O--o" has two hits. If we remove the "o" on the fourth note, that reduces by 1, making S total 5. Then total becomes 3 +5 =8, which is exactly the limit.

Alternatively, adjust kick or snare. Let's see:

Option 1:
- Hihat: all dashes (0)
- Snare: change last beat's "O--o" to "O---" (removing the last o).  
Then S becomes:  
Beat2: Oo-o (3) → stays.  
Beat3: -o-- (1)  
Beat4: O--- (1)  
Total S: 3+1+1=5.  
Total: K3 + S5 + H0 =8.

That works.

Alternatively, maybe keep one hihat hit but that might complicate. Let's go with the first option.

So, editing:

K remains as is (3 notes).  
S: Last beat's fourth note becomes -, so S line becomes:  
"----|Oo-o|-o--|O---"  
H: All dashes.

Check counts again:

K: 3  
S: Beat2: O, o, -, o → Wait, if last beat is O---, then beat4 is O, -, -, -, so total S:  
Beat1:0, Beat2:3 (O, o, o?), Wait original S line was "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o". Wait, let me recount:

Original S line breakdown:

Original S:
Beat1: ---- (0)
Beat2: O o - o → 4 characters: O, o, -, o → that's 3 hits (O, o, o? Wait, the 'o' is a soft hit, but still counts as a note. So 4th character is o, so total 3 hits? Wait, positions 1: O, 2:o, 4:o → 3 hits.

Beat3: - o - - → 1 hit (the o)
Beat4: O - - o → O and o → 2 hits.  
Total 3+1+2=6. 

If we change beat4 to O---, then beat4 has only O (1 hit).  
So new S total: 3 (beat2) +1 (beat3) +1 (beat4) =5. 

Yes, that brings total to 3+5=8. Perfect.

So the edited groove would be:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----  
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, but let me confirm each line's note count again.

Kick:
O--O has O on first and fourth 16th notes (positions 1 and 4 of first beat) → 2 notes.  
Then third beat has -O-- (position 3 of third beat) → 1 note.  
Total 3.

Snare:
Beat2: O (1), o (2), then o (4) → 3 hits.  
Beat3: o (2) → 1.  
Beat4: O (1) → 1.  
Total 5.

Hihat: all dashes, 0.  
Total 3+5=8. Perfect.

Alternatively, maybe the user prefers even fewer, but exactly 8 is allowed.

Alternatively, maybe the kick can be reduced. Let's see: if we leave kick as is (3) and snare at 5, that's okay. Alternatively, maybe reduce kick to 2, snare to 6, but no, that would exceed. So the current plan works.
