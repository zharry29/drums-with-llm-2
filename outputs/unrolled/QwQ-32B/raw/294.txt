Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a specific drum notation and an existing groove, and the request is to add ride in addition to the hihat. 

First, I need to understand the current groove structure. Looking at the given drum groove:

- **Kick (K):** -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
- **Snare (S):** ----|----|S---|----
- **Hihat (H):** x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
- **Toms (T):** ----|----|---O|----
- **Crash (C):** O---|O---|O---|O---
- **Ride (R):** ----|----|----|----

The user wants not only hihat but also ride. Currently, the ride (R) is all dashes, meaning it's not played. The hihat is active with "x-x-" in each beat, which are closed hits (since H's x is a closed hit). 

To add ride, I should replace some of the hihat's notes with ride, or add ride in between. But since the instruction is to have "not only hihat but also ride," it means keeping the hihat and adding ride, not replacing. 

Looking at the ride's notation possibilities:
- Ride can use X and x for closed hits on the bow, or O and o for bell hits. Since the hihat is using x (closed), maybe using X on ride for closed bow hits would complement it without clashing. 

A common approach is to have the ride playing a steady pattern, like a steady eighth notes or sixteenth notes. Since the hihat is already on every 16th note (x-x- etc.), adding ride on the offbeats or alternating could work. 

Alternatively, since the user's previous edits often used -X-X- patterns, maybe a consistent X on every other 16th note would fit. Let me check previous examples the user provided. 

Looking back at previous interactions, when adding ride, the assistant often used a pattern like -X-X repeated in each beat. For example:
- R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X

This creates a steady closed ride hit on the "and" of each beat. Since the hihat is already on every 16th note, this would layer the ride on the offbeats, creating a syncopated feel without conflicting with the hihat.

Therefore, applying that pattern here, the ride line would be "-X-X" for each beat. Let me confirm that the existing hihat and ride don't clash. The hihat is x-x- (so on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th 16th notes of each beat?), but actually, each beat is four 16ths, so the hihat is on every 16th note (x-x- would be positions 1, 3, 5, 7? Wait, each beat is four characters. Let me parse that again.

Wait, each beat is four characters (since four 16ths make a beat). So each | separates beats. For example, H's line is x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x- meaning in each beat, the hihat is played on the first and third 16th notes (x at positions 1 and 3, then - on 2 and 4). So the pattern is hit on 1 and 3 of each beat's 16ths.

If the ride is set to -X-X, that would be hit on the 2nd and 4th 16th notes of each beat. That would complement the hihat's 1 and 3, filling in the offbeats. That makes sense and avoids overlap.

Therefore, adding R: -X-X in each beat section would satisfy the requirement. Let me check the crash line as well. The crash is O--- in each beat, meaning a hard hit on the first 16th of each beat. The ride's pattern won't interfere with that.

So the edited groove would have the ride line as -X-X repeated across all four beats. That should fulfill the edit request.
