Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants snare on every 16th note in the second beat. First, I need to understand the current setup.

Looking at the provided groove:

**K (Kick):** -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-  
**S (Snare):** ----|----|S---|----  
**H (Hihat):** x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-  
**T (Toms):** ----|----|---O|----  
**C (Crash):** O---|O---|O---|O---  
**R (Ride):** ----|----|----|----

The second beat is separated by the second |. Let's break it down beat by beat. Each beat has four 16th notes. The second beat for Snare (S) is "----", meaning no hits. The user wants every 16th note in that beat to have a snare hit. 

So, for the second beat (the part after the first | and before the second |), the Snare line should be "OOOO" since each of the four 16th notes needs a hit. The original S line was "----|----|S---|----", so replacing the second beat's "----" with "OOOO".

But I need to check if there are any other instruments conflicting or if the user has constraints. The Kick in the second beat is "OO--", Toms are "----", so no conflict. The Crash is "O---" in the second beat, but that's on the first 16th note. The Snare's O's would add hits on all four 16th notes there.

Wait, the user's instruction is only about the snare, so other instruments can stay. Let me confirm the notation: "O" is a hard hit for Snare. Since they want every 16th note, using "O" for all four positions in the second beat's snare line makes sense.

So the edited S line becomes: "----|OOOO|S---|----".

Wait, the original third beat's snare was "S---". The user didn't mention changing that, so leave it as is. So the full S line would be:

S: ----|OOOO|S---|----

Now check the total notes. Let me count the snare hits:

First beat: 0 (from "----")
Second beat: 4 (from "OOOO")
Third beat: 1 (the first "S" in "S---")
Fourth beat: 0

Total snare notes: 5. That's okay unless there's another constraint, but the user only specified the second beat. The edit meets the request. 

Other instruments can stay as they are. So the final groove should reflect this change.
