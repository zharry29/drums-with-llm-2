Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a drum groove and wants it to include not only hihat but also cymbal. Looking at the current groove:

First, check the existing instruments. The Kick (K) has some hits, Snare (S) too. The Hihat (H) line is all dashes, meaning it's not playing. Toms (T) are also silent. The Crash (C) is off, and Ride (R) has some pattern with 'o-O-' repeating.

The edit request says to add hihat and cymbal. Wait, the original request says "not only hihat but also cymbal"—so maybe the groove already has hihat, but needs cymbal? Wait, no, looking again. The current Hihat line is all dashes, so actually, the groove doesn't have hihat at all. The user might have meant that it should have both hihat and cymbal, since right now it only has snare, kick, and ride. So the task is to add hihat and ensure cymbal is there too. Wait, but Ride is a cymbal. The user might want Crash or another cymbal added?

Wait the current Ride (R) is active with 'o-O-' patterns, so maybe the user wants Crash cymbal (C) added as well. Alternatively, maybe they want to replace Ride with Crash, but the instruction is to add cymbal in addition to hihat. So perhaps add both hihat and crash?

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to ensure that both hihat and at least one cymbal (either crash or ride) are present. Since Ride is already there, maybe just adding hihat is sufficient, but the request says "not only hihat but also cymbal"—so perhaps the groove currently has hihat but not cymbal? Wait no, in the given groove, Hihat is all dashes, so it's missing. The Ride is present, so maybe the user wants to add hihat and ensure cymbal (which is already there via Ride). But the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse again.

Original groove given:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

So Hihat (H) is completely silent. The Ride (R) has a pattern. The edit request says "should have not only hihat but also cymbal". Wait, perhaps the user meant that currently, there's only Ride (a cymbal), and they want to add hihat as another cymbal? But hihat is a different instrument. Alternatively, maybe the user wants both hihat and crash cymbal (C), since Ride is already a cymbal. Alternatively, maybe the user thought that hihat is a cymbal, but according to the instruments listed, Hihat is separate from crash and ride. So the user wants to add hihat (H) and also ensure that there's a cymbal (like Crash or Ride). Since Ride is already there, adding hihat would fulfill the request. But the wording says "not only hihat but also cymbal", which might mean that the groove should have both hihat and a cymbal (so adding hihat is needed, and since cymbal (Ride) is there, that's okay). Alternatively, maybe the user wants to add Crash cymbal as another cymbal in addition to Ride. Let me check the previous examples.

Looking at the user's history, in some previous edits, when asked to add cymbal, they added Crash on certain beats. For example, in one instance, they added C: O--- on certain beats. So perhaps here, since the current groove has Ride but no Crash, maybe the user wants to add Crash as well. But the instruction is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to add hihat and ensure that there's a cymbal (which is already present via Ride), so just adding hihat would be sufficient. But the wording "not only hihat but also cymbal" might imply that both should be present, so adding hihat and keeping the existing Ride. Since Ride is a cymbal, that's okay. 

So the main task is to add hihat (H) and ensure cymbal (which is already there via Ride). So I need to add some hihat hits. Let's choose a pattern. Since the existing Ride has a quarter note pattern (o-O- repeating), maybe the hihat can have a steady 16th note closed hits (using X or x). For example, X-x- on each beat to make it a steady eighth note pattern. Let's try that.

So modifying H line to X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x- so that hihat is playing closed hits on every 16th note. That would add the hihat. Since the existing Ride is already a cymbal, the request is satisfied. Alternatively, maybe adding Crash on certain beats. But since the user's instruction says "not only hihat but also cymbal", perhaps they want both hihat and another cymbal. Let me check the original groove's C line: it's all dashes, so Crash isn't being used. Maybe the user wants to add Crash as well. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and meant that the groove should have not only Ride but also hihat and Crash. But given the exact wording, it's safer to assume that the user wants to add hihat and ensure there's a cymbal (which is already present via Ride). So adding hihat is sufficient. 

Thus, the edited groove should have H with some hits, and leave the existing Ride. Let's set H to X-x- repeated across all beats to give a steady eighth note closed hihat. That would fulfill the requirement.
