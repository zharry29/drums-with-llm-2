Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a drum pattern and wants to remove the ride on beat 4 while keeping everything else the same. 

First, I need to look at the original groove. The given drum notation is:

@@@
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

Wait, actually, looking at the R line (Ride cymbal), it's all dashes except maybe the last beat? Wait, no, in the provided groove, the R line is all dashes. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake? Wait, the user says "I don't want ride on beat 4", but in the original, the ride isn't playing at all. Let me double-check.

Looking again, the R line is: R: ----|----|----|----. So there's no ride playing in any beat. That's odd. The user might have intended that there was a ride on beat 4, but in the given notation, it's not there. Maybe there was a typo in the input?

Wait, perhaps in the original problem, the R line might have had some hits. Let me check the user's exact input again. The user's input shows:

The given drum groove is enclosed in @@@, and the R line is:

R: ----|----|----|----

So no, there's nothing there. But the user is asking to remove ride on beat 4. Maybe the user intended that there was a ride on beat 4 but it's not present here. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the input. However, since the user is following a pattern from previous examples, maybe in their actual provided groove, there was an R on beat 4. Wait, let me check the exact input again.

Wait, the user's input shows the R line as all dashes. Hmm, perhaps the user made an error in their input. Alternatively, maybe I need to proceed with the given data. Since the user's instruction says "I don't want ride on beat 4 but everything else is fine," but in the provided groove, there's no ride on any beat. Therefore, the edit would leave it as is. But that's probably not the case. Maybe I misread the input.

Wait, let me look again. The user's provided groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, R is all dashes. So maybe the user made a mistake in the request? Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have the ride on beat 4 but it's missing here. Since the user's instruction is to remove ride on beat 4, but there's no ride there, perhaps the correct action is to just output the same as input. But that seems unlikely. Maybe the user is referring to another part of the pattern?

Alternatively, perhaps the user confused ride with another instrument. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the input. But given the problem as stated, I have to work with what's provided. Since the R line is empty, removing ride on beat 4 doesn't change anything. Therefore, the edited groove would be identical to the original. But that might not be what the user wants. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the R line had something, so perhaps there was a typo in the input.

Alternatively, maybe in the user's input, the R line was supposed to have something on beat 4. Let me check the previous interactions. Looking back at the user's history, in previous similar requests, sometimes the R line had content. For example, in the first example the user provided:

Original groove had R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-, and the edit removed the 4th beat. 

In this case, perhaps the user intended that the R line here has something on beat 4 but it's missing. Maybe they made a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to ensure that even if there's nothing, just confirm that the ride is not present. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the Hihat or another instrument. But the user specifically mentioned "ride on beat 4". 

Alternatively, maybe I should proceed as follows: since the user's instruction says to remove ride on beat 4, even if it's not there, just output the same. So the final answer would be the same as the input. But that's probably not the case. Maybe I misread the user's input. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's input shows:

The R line is all dashes. So no ride is playing. Therefore, the edit request is to remove ride on beat4, but since it's already not there, the answer is the same. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the R line was supposed to have something. For example, maybe the R line was:

R: ----|----|----|X--- 

But in the user's input it's all dashes. Since I have to work with what's given, perhaps I should just output the same. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the R line to have a hit on beat4 but forgot to include it, so the edit is to leave it as is. 

In any case, following the given data, the correct edit would leave the R line as all dashes, so the final output would be the same as the input. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have the R line with something on beat4, so I should check if there's a mistake in the input. But since I can't ask, I have to proceed with the given data. 

Thus, the final answer would be the same as the original, but the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I missed something. Let me check the user's request again.

The user's edit request: "I don't want ride on beat 4 but everything else is fine." 

Given that in the original R line has nothing, so the edit is already done. Therefore, the answer is the same as the original. 

So the final output would be:

@@@
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

But maybe the user expects that even if it's not there, it's confirmed. So I'll proceed with that.
