Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a specific drum notation and wants me to remove any cymbals or toms. Let me start by understanding the original groove.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

First, I need to identify which lines correspond to cymbals and toms. According to the notation:

- **C** is Crash cymbal.
- **R** is Ride cymbal.
- **T** is Toms.

The user's request is to remove any cymbals (so both Crash and Ride) and toms. That means I should set the **C**, **R**, and **T** lines to all '-' characters.

Let me check each line:

- **Kick (K):** OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO – This stays as it's part of the kick drum, which is allowed.
- **Snare (S):** ----|O---|----|O--- – Also okay, snare is allowed.
- **Hihat (H):** Already all '-' so no change needed here.
- **Toms (T):** Already all '-' so no action required.
- **Crash (C):** O---|O---|O---|O--- – Need to remove all, set to all '-'.
- **Ride (R):** Already all '-', so no change.

Wait, but the user mentioned "cymbal or tom". Since Toms are already silent, but Crash is active. So only the **C** line needs to be cleared. The **R** line is already clear. 

So the edited version should have:

K remains the same.  
S remains the same.  
H remains the same.  
T remains the same (all '-').  
C becomes all '-'.  
R remains all '-'.  

Let me write that out:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

Double-checking: No cymbals (C and R are both '-' everywhere), toms (T is all '-'). The kick and snare are untouched. That should meet the user's request.
