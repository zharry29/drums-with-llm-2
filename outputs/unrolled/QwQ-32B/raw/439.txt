Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. Let me start by understanding what they want. The user said, "I don't want any kick or ride." 

First, I'll recall the given drum groove. The original has lines for each instrument: K (Kick), S (Snare), H (Hihat), T (Toms), C (Crash), and R (Ride). The user wants to remove any parts involving the kick drum (K) and the ride cymbal (R). 

Looking at the provided drum notation:

@@@
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

So, the Kick (K) line has some hits like O--O etc., and the Ride (R) line is all dashes except maybe in some spots, but here it's empty. The user wants both removed. 

Wait, in the given groove, the R line is already all dashes, so removing it won't change much there. But the Kick line has notes. So, to comply with the request, I need to set all characters in the K line to '-' and leave the R line as it is (since it's already empty). 

Let me double-check each line. The S (Snare) has some activity, H (Hihat) is active with X and x, T and C are inactive. Since the user only wants to remove kick and ride, the rest should stay. 

So the edited version should have K line as all '-' and R line as all '-'. Let me write that out:

K: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The rest remains the same. Let me make sure there are no typos. The original K line was "O--O|----|--O-|----", so replacing each character with '-' gives four beats of four dashes each. 

Yes, that should do it. The final result should look like this between the @@@:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----

R: ----|----|----|----
