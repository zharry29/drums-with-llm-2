Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a kick hit and tom in the very beginning. Let's look at the original groove first.

The given drum groove is:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----  

Hmm, the kick (K) starts with "OOO-" on the first beat. The user wants a kick hit and tom at the very beginning. Wait, the kick already has hits there. Maybe they want an additional kick hit and a tom hit at the very first 16th note?

Wait, the first beat of the kick is "OOO-", so the first three 16th notes are O's. The tom (T) line is all dashes, so adding a tom hit there. The user might want the first note to have both kick and tom. Since the kick is already hitting on the first three 16th notes, maybe just adding a tom hit on the first note.

So, for the Tom line (T), the first character should be an 'O' (hard hit) to match the beginning. Let's check the notation rules for Toms: O is hard, o is soft. Since the user didn't specify soft, default to O.

So, changing the first character of T's first beat from '-' to 'O'. The rest of T remains the same. Let me verify:

Original T line: T: ----|----|----|----

After edit: T: O---|----|----|----

So the first beat of T is now O, matching the kick's first hit. That should satisfy adding a tom hit at the very beginning. The kick is already there, so the edit is just adding the tom. I think that's what the user wants. Let me double-check the request: "kick hit and tom in the very beginning." Since the kick is already present, adding the tom there. Looks good.
