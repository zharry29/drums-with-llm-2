Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove to include both hihat and cymbal. Let me look at the original groove first.

The given groove has Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R). The user wants not just hihat but also cymbal. Wait, the original already has Crash (C) with O--- in each beat. Hmm, maybe the user means adding Ride cymbal (R) as well? Because Crash is already there. Let me check the edit request again.

The request says "not only hihat but also cymbal." Since hihat is already present (H line has x-x- etc.), maybe they want another cymbal, like Ride, to be added alongside the existing Crash. Or perhaps they want to replace some parts of Crash with Ride? Or maybe the user intended to mention both hihat and cymbal (like adding another cymbal layer)? 

Looking at the original groove:
- Crash (C) is hitting hard on every beat: O---|O---|O---|O---. That's pretty heavy. Maybe adding Ride (R) to complement it?
- The Hihat is already active with x-x- patterns, so that's covered. The user probably wants to add Ride cymbal to the existing Crash, so both cymbals are present.

So the task is to add Ride (R) in addition to the existing Crash (C). Let me see the current R line: it's all dashes. So I need to add some Ride hits. 

The existing elements:
- Kick has a pattern with O's and --- in different beats.
- Snare has S--- in the third beat, which might be a typo since S's notation uses O, o, X, x. Wait, in the given groove, the S line is "----|----|S---|----". Oh, "S" isn't a valid notation. The user might have made a mistake here. According to the notation rules, S can be O, o, X, x. So maybe that's an error, but since the edit request is about adding cymbals, maybe I should focus on that and ignore the S issue unless it's part of the problem.

Assuming the S line's "S" is a typo, but since the user hasn't mentioned it, I'll proceed with the cymbal addition.

To add Ride, I can place some X or x on the Ride line. Maybe a steady pattern or syncopated. Since the Crash is on every beat, Ride could be on off-beats. Let's look at the existing Hihat's x-x- which is 16th notes. Maybe a Ride pattern that complements that.

Looking at the R line, starting with dashes. Let's try adding a consistent pattern. For example, on every 8th note, or every 16th. Since the Crash is on the downbeats, Ride could play on the "&" (the "and" of each beat). 

Let's try adding X on the offbeats. For example, in each beat of four 16th notes, maybe X on the second and fourth? Let's see:

Original beats divided by | into four beats. Each beat is four 16ths.

For the Ride line (R), maybe a pattern like -X-X| repeated. So each beat would be "-X-X", making it "X on the second and fourth 16th notes. That would give a steady 8th note feel with the Ride.

Alternatively, maybe a "X-x-" pattern to add some variation. Let me test:

First beat: "-X-X" would be positions 2 and 4 as X. But using the notation's characters, maybe starting with a soft or hard hit. Since Ride can have O (hard bell), o (soft bell), X/x (closed bow). 

The user's example uses X and x for Ride's closed hits. Let's go with X for a harder hit on the bow. 

So for the R line: 

Beat 1: -X-X (so first 16th is -, second X, third -, fourth X)
But each beat is four characters. Let me structure each beat as four characters separated by |.

Putting it all together for R:

R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X 

But maybe align with the existing Hihat's x-x- which is also every other 16th. That might clash, so perhaps alternate. Alternatively, a different pattern. Let's see:

Alternatively, maybe start with X on the first 16th of each beat, but that might clash with the Crash on the first beat's first 16th (since C has O--- meaning first note is hit).

Alternatively, to avoid clashing with Crash, which is on the first 16th of each beat, the Ride could hit on the second and fourth. That way, they don't overlap. 

So R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X 

So each beat is "-X-X". That would give a steady 8th note pattern on the Ride. Let me check the total characters. Each line should have 16 characters (4 beats *4 notes). Let's count:

Each beat is 4 characters, so 4 beats would be 16. So "-X-X" repeated four times would be 16. 

Yes, that works. 

Now, adding that to the R line. The original R line was all dashes, so replacing it with this pattern would add the Ride hits. 

So the edited groove would have:

R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X 

Wait, but the user might prefer a different pattern. Alternatively, maybe using X and x for variation. Let me think. 

Alternatively, using X on the second and fourth 16ths of each beat. 

Another approach: since the Crash is on every beat's first 16th, the Ride could play on the third and fourth? Not sure. The initial idea of "-X-X" seems okay. 

Alternatively, maybe a "X---" pattern, but that would only hit once per beat. 

Alternatively, a syncopated pattern like X-X- which would be first and third, but then the first would clash with Crash. 

Hmm, the best bet is "-X-X" to avoid clashing and add a steady rhythm. 

So the final R line would be "-X-X" for each beat, making the full line:

R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X 

Therefore, the edited drum groove would include this Ride pattern along with the existing Crash and Hihat.
