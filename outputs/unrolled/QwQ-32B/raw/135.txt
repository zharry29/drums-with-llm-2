Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to include not only tom but also hihat. Let me first look at the given groove to see what's already there.

The original groove is:

@@@
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

Hmm, okay. The Kick (K) has some activity, Snare (S) on beats 2 and 4, Crash (C) is playing on every beat, but the Hihat (H) and Toms (T) are all dashes. The user says "not only tom but also hihat". Wait, actually, the current groove doesn't have any toms or hihat. So the user probably wants both added. The phrasing might be a bit confusing, but I think they want to add hihat in addition to toms. Or maybe they meant that currently there are only toms (but there aren't any here), so they want hihat as well? Let me read the request again.

"The groove should have not only tom but also hihat."

Ah, maybe it's saying that the groove shouldn't just have toms but also include hihat. Since currently there are no toms or hihat, adding both makes sense. But perhaps the user is pointing out that there are no hihats, and maybe some toms are present? Wait, in the given groove, Toms (T) are all dashes. So perhaps the user noticed that there are no hihats and wants them added. The "not only tom" part might be a mistake, or maybe they meant "not only the existing instruments (like kick, snare, crash) but also hihat and tom". 

Assuming that, I need to add both hihat and toms. Let me proceed with that.

First, let's look at the structure. The bar has four beats, each with four 16th notes. Let's see where to place the hihat and toms without clashing with existing parts.

The Kick is active on the first three 16th notes of the first beat (OOO-), then a rest and an O on the second beat (--O-), etc. The snare is on the second and fourth beats (O---). The crash is on every beat.

For hihat, a common pattern is a steady 8th or 16th note pattern. Since the hihat is currently empty, maybe add a closed hihat on every 8th note. The H line uses X and x for closed hits. Let's go with X on each quarter note and x on the & (the '+' in 16th notes?), but need to check the notation. Wait, each character is a 16th note. So each beat has four 16ths. Let's make a standard closed hihat on all 8th notes (every two 16ths). So for each beat, maybe X-x- or X-x- repeating. Let's try X-x- for each beat. That would give a steady 8th note pattern.

Now for toms (T). The user wants tom added, so let's pick a simple tom pattern. Maybe on the offbeats or syncopated. Since the crash is on every beat, perhaps the toms can play on the "and" of the beats. Let's see. For example, on the third 16th of each beat, or every other beat. Let me look at the existing kick and snare to avoid clashing. The snare is on beat 2 and 4. Let's see:

Looking at the first beat (K: OOO-), so first three 16ths are kick hits. Maybe the tom can play on the fourth 16th of the first beat? But that might clash with the next beat. Alternatively, maybe on the & of beat 1 (third 16th), but that's already a kick hit. Hmm, perhaps on the second beat. Let me think of a simple tom pattern that complements the kick and snare.

Alternatively, since the kick has a lot of activity, maybe the toms can be on the offbeats. Let's try placing a tom hit on the third 16th of each beat. For example, in each beat's four characters, maybe the third position. Let's see:

For each beat in T line: --O- or something. Let's try:

First beat (OOO- for K): Maybe T has a hit on the third 16th: --O- ?

Wait, the first beat's T line is currently ----, so changing to --O- would mean third 16th is a tom hit. Let's see:

T line for first beat: --O-  
Second beat: Let's see, the second beat's K is --O- (third 16th is O). Maybe T can have a hit on the first 16th? Or maybe a different pattern. Alternatively, make the tom play on every other beat. Alternatively, a syncopated rhythm.

Alternatively, perhaps a tom fill on the third beat where the kick has OOO-. Hmm, maybe it's better to keep it simple. Let's try a tom hit on the third 16th of each beat. So each T line would be --O- for each beat. But let's check the entire bar:

First beat: --O-  
Second beat: --O-  
Third beat: --O-  
Fourth beat: --O-  

But that might be too repetitive. Alternatively, vary it. Let me look at each beat's structure:

First beat (K: OOO-): The first three 16ths are kick. So tom on the fourth 16th (---- becomes --O-). 

Second beat (K: --O-): The third 16th is kick. So maybe the tom on the second or fourth?

Hmm, maybe it's better to have the tom on the second 16th of each beat. Let's try:

Each beat's T line: -O--. So first 16th is nothing, second is O, then rest.

But that might clash with kick? Let's see first beat's K is OOO-, so the second 16th is already a kick hit. So tom there would overlap. Not good.

Alternatively, on the fourth 16th of each beat. Let's try:

Each beat's T: ---O. So fourth 16th is tom.

First beat: fourth 16th is O (tom), but K's first beat ends with -, so that's okay.

Second beat: fourth 16th is O (tom), K's second beat is --O- (third is O, fourth is -). So okay.

Third beat: similar to first.

Fourth beat: fourth 16th O, K is -OOO (wait, the fourth beat's K is -OOO? Let me check:

Original K line: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
Breaking it down into four beats separated by |:

First beat: O O O -  
Second beat: - - O -  
Third beat: O O O -  
Fourth beat: - O O O  

Wait, the fourth beat is |-OOO, so the fourth beat's four 16ths are - O O O.

So for the fourth beat, the fourth 16th is O on kick, so placing tom on the fourth 16th would clash. So maybe on third 16th?

Fourth beat's third 16th is O (from K: -OOO), so third is O. Hmm, tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the tom plays on the first 16th of each beat. Let's try:

Each T line: O---. So first 16th of each beat is tom hit.

First beat: O---, so first 16th is tom, but K has O there. Clashing? Yes, since K's first 16th is O. So that's bad.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complex. Maybe a simpler approach. Let's choose a tom pattern that's sparse and doesn't interfere. Since the crash is on every beat, maybe the tom plays on the same as crash but as a different instrument. Alternatively, on the offbeats where kick isn't active.

Alternatively, let's look at the second beat. The second beat's K is --O-, so third 16th is O. Maybe the tom can hit on the first 16th of that beat, which is -, so T: O--- for the second beat.

Third beat's K is OOO-, so maybe tom on the fourth 16th.

Fourth beat's K has O's starting at the second 16th, so first 16th is -, so tom there.

This is getting too involved. Maybe a better approach is to make the tom play on every fourth 16th note except where kick is active. Alternatively, pick a simple pattern like every other beat.

Alternatively, let's use the tom on the third beat. Since the third beat's kick is OOO-, maybe the tom hits on the fourth 16th (---O). Let's try:

First beat: --O- (third 16th tom)  
Second beat: -O-- (second 16th tom)  
Third beat: ---O (fourth 16th tom)  
Fourth beat: O--- (first 16th tom, but that's where K's fourth beat has a - in first 16th? Wait, fourth beat is -OOO, so first 16th is -, so tom can hit there.

So putting that together:

T line would be:

First beat: --O-  
Second beat: -O--  
Third beat: ---O  
Fourth beat: O---  

But that might be too varied. Alternatively, a steady pattern like every third 16th note.

Alternatively, let's just pick a simple tom pattern on every fourth beat's third 16th. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the user just wants some tom hits added, so I can place a tom hit on the third beat's third 16th, and maybe others.

Alternatively, since the user might not care about the exact placement as long as toms are present, I can add a tom hit in each beat, maybe on the third 16th. Let's set each T line to --O- for all beats. Even if it overlaps with kick in some cases, but maybe that's acceptable. Let's see:

First beat's T: --O- would hit on third 16th, which is already a kick hit (third is O). That's a clash. Not good. So maybe second 16th:

Each T line: -O--. So second 16th of each beat. 

First beat's second 16th is already a kick hit (O), so that's bad.

Hmm. Maybe the third beat's third 16th is O for kick, so can't do that. 

Alternatively, the fourth beat's first 16th is -, so tom there. Let's try:

T line for each beat:

First beat: ---O (fourth 16th tom, which is okay because K's first beat ends with -  
Second beat: ---O (fourth 16th, since K's second beat is --O-, so fourth is -  
Third beat: ---O  
Fourth beat: O--- (first 16th) but K's fourth beat starts with -, so that's okay.

Wait, but fourth beat's fourth 16th is O on kick, so placing tom there would clash. So fourth beat's tom could be on first 16th (O---) or third?

Alternatively, maybe a tom on the second beat's first 16th.

This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should just pick a simple pattern that doesn't clash. Let me try placing a tom hit on the fourth 16th of each beat except where it would clash with kick.

First beat's fourth 16th is -, so T can hit there: --O- (third 16th tom?) Wait, no, fourth 16th would be the fourth character. So for first beat, T: ---O.

Second beat's fourth 16th is -, so T: ---O.

Third beat's fourth 16th is -, so T: ---O.

Fourth beat's fourth 16th is O (from K's fourth beat: -OOO), so can't hit there. So for fourth beat, maybe third 16th? The third 16th is O on kick, so no. Second 16th? The second is O. First 16th is -.

So fourth beat's T: O---.

Putting it all together:

T lines would be:

---O | ---O | ---O | O---

But the fourth beat's tom is on first 16th, which is okay.

Now for the hihat. Let's add a standard closed hihat on every 8th note. Each beat has four 16ths. So on the first and third 16th of each beat (the downbeats and the 'and' of the previous). Wait, 8th notes would be every two 16ths. So for each beat:

First 16th (1): X  
Second (1&): -  
Third (2): X  
Fourth (2&): -  

Wait, that would be X-X- for each beat, but that's 8th notes. Alternatively, to get a steady 8th, it would be X-x- for each beat, where the first and third 16ths are hits, but using closed hits (X and x). Let's use X on the downbeat and x on the 'and' of the previous. Wait, maybe X on the first and third 16ths of each beat. So:

Each H line: X-x- (X on first, x on third). That would give a steady 8th note pattern. Let's try that.

So for each beat in H:

X-x- | X-x- | X-x- | X-x-

That should work. Let me check:

First beat: X-x-  
Second beat: X-x-  
Third beat: X-x-  
Fourth beat: X-x-  

Yes, that's a standard closed hihat pattern on 8th notes.

Now, putting it all together:

Original lines with edits:

K remains the same: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S remains: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-  
T: ---O|---O|---O|O---  
C remains: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: still all dashes, but user didn't mention ride, only tom and hihat. Wait, the edit request was "not only tom but also hihat". The original didn't have tom or hihat. So adding both is okay. The user didn't mention ride, so leaving R as dashes is fine unless the request implied needing ride as well, but the wording was about adding hihat and tom. 

Wait, the user's request was "The groove should have not only tom but also hihat." Which could mean that currently it has tom (but it doesn't), so they want to add hihat. But since there are no toms, perhaps it's a mistake and they meant "not only the existing instruments (like kick, snare, crash) but also hihat and tom". 

Assuming that, adding both is correct. So the final edited groove would have H and T lines filled as above.

Let me verify the T line again. For the fourth beat's T line, since the first 16th is -, we can put O there. So the T line for fourth beat is O---, meaning first 16th is a tom hit. That's okay since K's fourth beat starts with -, so no clash. The rest of the T lines are ---O, which on beats 1,2,3's fourth 16ths which are -, so no clash with kick.

So the final edited groove would be:

@@@
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-  
T: ---O|---O|---O|O---  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----  
@@@

Wait, but the user's edit request was "not only tom but also hihat", implying that the existing groove already had tom, but in the given groove, T was all dashes. So maybe the user made a typo and meant "not only the existing instruments but also hihat and tom". Either way, adding both is the right move here. I think this should work.
