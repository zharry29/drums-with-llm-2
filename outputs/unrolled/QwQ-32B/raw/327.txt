Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a groove and wants to remove any ride or snare. Let me first look at the original groove they gave:

S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So, breaking this down:

- **Kick (K):** Plays on the first and third beats (hard hits), which is standard for a 4/4 beat.
- **Snare (S):** Hits on the second and fourth beats, which is typical for backbeats.
- **Hihat (H):** Closed hits on all 16th notes, creating a steady rhythm.
- **Toms (T), Crash (C), Ride (R):** All silent.

The user's request is to remove any ride or snare. Since the ride (R) is already inactive, we just need to eliminate the snare (S). 

Looking at the snare line (S), it has hits on the second and fourth beats. To comply with the request, those need to be replaced with '-' to indicate no hit. 

However, removing the snare might leave the groove feeling empty, so maybe adding some kick or toms could help maintain the groove's energy. But the user didn't mention adding anything else, just removing ride and snare. So strictly following the request, I should only remove the snare.

Wait, the user said "I don't want any ride or snare." Since ride is already not present (all '-' in R line), only the snare needs to be taken out. 

So, modifying the S line to all '-' and ensuring R remains all '-'. Let's check the other lines to make sure there's no unintended changes. The kick remains as is, hihat stays closed, and toms/crash are still silent. 

Final check: 

- K: Unchanged.
- S: All '-'.
- H: Unchanged.
- T, C, R: Already silent.

That should meet the user's requirement. Let me write that out in the notation.
