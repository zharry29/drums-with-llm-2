Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a drum groove and wants me to edit it so that there's no tom on beat 4. Let me start by understanding the current groove.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

The T line (Toms) is ----|----|---O|----. That means the toms are hitting on the third 16th note of the third beat (since each | separates beats, so the third beat's characters are ---O). Wait, the user said "no tom on beat 4". Let me check each beat:

Breaking down the Toms line:

Beat 1: ---- (no hits)
Beat 2: ---- (no hits)
Beat 3: ---O (hit on the 4th 16th note of beat 3)
Beat 4: ---- (no hits here already)

Wait, hold on. The user's request is to remove the tom on beat 4, but in the current Toms line, beat 4 is already empty. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me recheck:

The Toms line is written as four parts separated by |: 

First beat: ---- (no hits)
Second beat: ---- (no hits)
Third beat: ---O (hit on the last 16th note of beat 3)
Fourth beat: ---- (no hits here)

So actually, there's no tom on beat 4 to begin with. The only tom hit is on beat 3's last 16th note. But the user is asking to remove the tom on beat 4. Maybe there was a mistake in the input? Or perhaps I misinterpreted the beats?

Wait, maybe the user is referring to the fourth beat's first note? Let me check the original notation again. Each | separates beats, so each segment is four characters (each being a 16th note). So beat 4 is the fourth segment. The T line's fourth segment is "----", so no hits there. Therefore, the user might have a typo, but since the instruction is clear, maybe the intended was to remove the tom on beat 3's fourth note? Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to ensure that no toms are played in beat 4, but since it's already not there, the groove is already correct. But maybe the user's request was based on a different part? Alternatively, maybe the T line was supposed to have a hit on beat 4, but in the given groove it's not there. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in parsing the T line. Let me check again. The T line is written as:

T: ----|----|---O|----

Yes, so the third beat has a tom hit on the fourth 16th note (the "O" at the end of the third segment). The fourth beat's segment is "----", so no hit there. Therefore, the user's request doesn't affect this groove because there's no tom on beat 4. But since the user says "everything else is fine", maybe I should just confirm that the Toms line remains the same except for beat 4, which is already clear. Therefore, the edited version would be the same as the original. But maybe the user made a mistake and actually wanted to remove the tom on beat 3? Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the beat numbering. Let me count again:

The bar is divided into four beats, each with four 16th notes. The Toms line's fourth beat is the last segment, which is "----". So there's no tom on beat 4. Therefore, the groove as given already satisfies the user's request. Hence, the edited version is the same as the original. But maybe the user intended to have a tom on beat 4 and wants it removed, but in the given groove it's not there. In that case, the answer remains unchanged. I'll proceed to output the same groove, ensuring that the Toms line's fourth beat is still "----".
