Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to have not only cymbal (which is already present via the Crash cymbal line C) but also the Ride cymbal. 

Looking at the given groove:

- **Kick (K):** Has some activity, especially in the first and third beats.
- **Snare (S):** Snare hits on the second and fourth beats, typical for a 4/4 rhythm.
- **Hihat (H):** Some closed and open hits, but not too dense.
- **Crash (C):** A hard hit on the first 16th note of the first beat, then silent elsewhere.
- **Ride (R):** Completely inactive right now.

The edit request is to add Ride cymbal. Since the Crash is already there, the user probably wants to layer the Ride in without removing the Crash. The Ride can add a steady or syncopated pattern.

First, I'll check what the Ride can do. The notation allows for O (hard bell hit), o (soft bell), and X/x (closed bow hits). To complement the existing Crash on the first note, maybe start the Ride on the first beat but softer, like an 'o' to not clash. Then, a common ride pattern is quarter notes on the bow (X or x), or 8th notes. Since Hihat is already on some 16th notes, maybe syncopate the Ride.

Looking at the Hihat's pattern: the first beat has "--o-" and the rest have variations. To not conflict, perhaps a steady 8th note pattern on the Ride. Let's try placing X (hard closed hit) on every other 16th note, but maybe alternating with the Crash. Since the Crash is only on the first note of the first beat, the Ride can take over the other beats.

Let me draft:

For each beat:
- First beat: C has an O on the first 16th, so Ride could do something like O--- to match, but maybe start with a bell hit. Alternatively, let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the Ride plays on the "&" of each beat (the offbeats) to add swing. Let's try:

R: -X-X | -X-X | -X-X | -X-X (but adjusted per the existing elements). Wait, let's look at each beat:

First beat:
K: O---
S: ----
H: --o-
C: O---
So first 16th note has Kick and Crash. Ride could have a soft bell (o) there to not clash, then maybe X on the second 16th. So: o-X- ?

Second beat:
K: ---o
S: O---
H: O-o-
C: ----
R needs to add. Maybe X on the first 16th (since S has a hit on the first 16th?), but maybe better to alternate.

Third beat:
K: O-O-
S: ----
H: O-o-
C: ----
Fourth beat:
K: ----
S: O---
H: O-o-
C: ----

Hmm, maybe a consistent pattern like X on every 8th note (positions 1 and 3 of each beat), but using closed hits (X/x). Let's try:

For each beat's four 16ths:
Beat 1: O--- (Kick and Crash first note), so R could do o (soft bell on 1st), then X on 2nd, -, X on 4th? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe a steady X every beat's first and third 16th.

Alternatively, since the user said "not only cymbal but also ride," maybe just add a simple ride pattern. Let's try:

R: X-x- | X-x- | X-x- | X-x- (assuming X on 1st and 3rd 16th notes of each beat, with x on the offbeats? Wait, notation is per 16th note. Let me structure it properly.

Each beat is four 16th notes. Let's do a quarter note on the ride (two 16ths per beat), but perhaps:

For each beat's four 16ths:

R: X--- | X--- | X--- | X--- (hit on first of each beat). But that's sparse. Alternatively, eighth notes:

R: X-x- | X-x- | X-x- | X-x- (so every 8th note, which is two 16ths). That would make the ride play on beats 1 and 3 of each beat (e.g., first 16th and third 16th). Let's see:

First beat:
R: X-x- would be X on first 16th (along with Kick and Crash), then x on third. But the Crash is O on first, so maybe that's okay. The X is a closed hit, so not as loud as Crash's O.

Second beat:
R: X-x- so X on first 16th (with S's O on same time?), which might be okay for a rock feel.

Alternatively, to avoid clashing with the snare, maybe start the Ride hits on the "&" (second 16th of the beat). Let's try:

R: -X-- | -X-- | -X-- | -X-- (on the second 16th of each beat). But that's sparse. Maybe a combination.

Alternatively, a 16th note pattern with alternating X and x. Let's try:

R: X-x- | X-x- | X-x- | X-x- for each beat. So each beat has X on 1st, x on 3rd. That would give a steady eighth-note pattern on the ride, which is common.

This way, the Ride adds a consistent rhythm without clashing too much with existing elements. The Crash is only on the first note of the first beat, so the Ride can take over the other parts.

So the edited Ride line would be:

R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

But let me check each beat again:

First beat:
C has O on first 16th. Ride's X there is a closed hit, so maybe that's okay. Alternatively, use 'o' (soft bell) on first to blend, but maybe the user wants Ride active. Let's proceed with the above.

Thus, the final groove would have Ride added in that pattern, keeping the Crash as is.
