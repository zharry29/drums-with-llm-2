Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any kick or cymbal parts. Let me look at the original groove first.

Starting with the Kick (K line): It has O---|---o|O-O-|----. Since the user doesn't want any kick, I'll replace all those characters with dashes.

Next, the Snare (S line) is ----|O---|----|O---. That's okay to keep unless there's a cymbal involved, but snare is allowed. Wait, the request was no kick or cymbal. So Snare is still okay.

Hihat (H line) has --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-. That's fine since it's not a cymbal. The Toms (T) are all dashes, so no change there. 

Crash (C) is O---|----|----|----. Need to remove that entirely, so set all to dashes.

Ride (R) is all dashes, so that's okay. 

Wait, let me double-check each line:

- K: Replace all with ----|----|----|----
- S: Leave as is because snare is allowed.
- H: Keep as is.
- T: Already clear.
- C: Set to ----|----|----|----
- R: Already clear.

Yes, that should do it. Let me make sure I didn't miss any cymbals. The Crash line was the only one with hits. The final groove should have no kick or cymbal, so the edited version should look like that.
