Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the cymbal on beat 4, but keep everything else the same. Let me first parse the given groove to understand where the cymbals are.

Looking at the provided groove:

The C (Crash cymbal) line is all dashes, so no crash. The R (Ride cymbal) line is:

R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Breaking this down into beats (each | separates beats):

Beat 1: x---
Beat 2: X-x-
Beat 3: x---
Beat 4: X-x-

The user wants no cymbal on beat 4. The ride cymbal (R) has hits on the first and third 16th notes of beat 4 (X and x). To remove the cymbal on beat 4, I need to set those to '-'.

So, changing the fourth beat of R from X-x- to ----. Let me verify:

Original R line: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
After edit: x---|X-x-|x---|----

Check other instruments: K, S, H, T, C are all okay as per the request. The user said "everything else is fine," so no changes there. Just the ride cymbal's fourth beat needs to be silent.

Double-checking the notation rules for R: X and x are closed hits on the bow. Since we're removing them, replacing with '-' is correct.

Final adjusted groove should have the last beat of R as dashes. Let me format that correctly.
