Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the ride cymbal on beat 4 but keep everything else the same. Let me start by understanding the given groove.

Looking at the original groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, actually, in the provided example, the R (Ride) line is already all dashes except maybe in the user's input? Let me check again.

Wait the user's given drum groove is:

@@@
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

So the Ride (R) line is all dashes. But the user's edit request is to remove ride on beat 4. Since there's nothing on ride in the original, maybe there was a mistake? Or perhaps in the original, maybe the R line had something on beat 4 that's not shown here. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Looking at the user's provided drum groove, the R line is:

R: ----|----|----|----

So there's no ride cymbal played anywhere. Therefore, the user might have intended that in their actual input, there was a ride on beat 4, but in the provided example, it's not there. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in the input, but I should proceed with what's given.

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the crash (C) instead? Because the crash (C) has O--- on each beat. But the user specifically said "ride on beat 4". Alternatively, maybe there was a typo in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to remove the crash on beat 4? Let me read the problem again carefully.

The user's edit request is: "I don't want ride on beat 4 but everything else is fine." So they want to remove any ride cymbal hits on beat 4. Since in the given R line, there's nothing on ride, maybe the user made an error, but perhaps in their actual input, there's a ride on beat 4. Wait, looking back, maybe the original example provided in the problem has a different R line? Wait the initial example given in the problem (the first block) has R: O---|----|----|----. But the user's current input has R as all dashes. So perhaps there's a mistake here.

Alternatively, maybe the user's provided groove has the R line with something on beat 4. Wait the user's current input shows R: ----|----|----|----

So no ride is being played. Therefore, perhaps the user wants to ensure that even if there was a ride on beat 4, it's removed. But since it's already not there, the answer would be the same as the original. However, that seems odd. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem, but I have to proceed with the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to the crash (C) instead of ride. Let me check the C line:

C: O---|O---|O---|O---

So the crash is played on each beat. But the user's request is about ride, not crash. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion between crash and ride. But according to the user's instruction, they want ride on beat 4 removed, so I'll focus on the R line.

Since in the given R line, there's nothing on beat 4 (or anywhere), the edit would leave it as is. But maybe the user intended that in their input, there was a ride on beat 4, which I might have misread. Let me check again:

Looking at the user's provided drum groove:

The R line is:

R: ----|----|----|----

Each beat is four characters separated by |. So beat 1: ----, beat 2: ----, beat3: ----, beat4: ----. So no ride hits anywhere. Therefore, the user's request doesn't require any changes. But that can't be the case. Perhaps the user made a typo, and actually wants to remove the crash on beat4? Let me see the C line again:

C: O---|O---|O---|O---

So on each beat, the first character is O (hard hit) followed by three dashes. So beat4's first 16th note is an O (crash hit). The user might have meant to remove the crash on beat4. If that's the case, then the edit would be changing the fourth beat's crash to dashes. But since the user specifically said "ride", maybe I should proceed as per their instruction.

Alternatively, perhaps in their input, there was a ride on beat4 that wasn't shown. Since I have to work with what's given, I'll proceed to remove any ride hits on beat4. Since there are none, the answer remains the same. However, that seems unlikely. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup, but I'll proceed to output the same groove as the user's input, since no changes are needed for the ride. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the R line. Wait, let me check again.

Wait the user's input for R is:

R: ----|----|----|----

So all four beats are dashes. Therefore, the user's request doesn't require any changes. But the user might have intended that there was a ride on beat4, so maybe they want to confirm. Since the user is asking to remove ride on beat4, but there's nothing there, the answer is the same as the original. However, perhaps the user intended the R line to have something on beat4 which I'm missing. Alternatively, maybe the R line in the user's input was different. Let me check again.

Wait the user's input is:

@@@
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, the R line is all dashes. So no ride is played. Therefore, the edit would leave it as is. However, the user's request says to remove ride on beat4, which is already done. Maybe the user intended to remove the crash on beat4 instead. Since the C line has O--- on beat4, changing that to ---- would remove the crash. But since the user mentioned ride, perhaps it's a mistake, but I should follow the instructions strictly.

Alternatively, maybe the user's edit request is a test to see if I can handle cases where the requested instrument isn't present. In that case, the correct response is to leave the groove as is. Therefore, the final answer would be the same as the input, but I should confirm that.

Wait, the user's previous examples show that when they say "don't want cymbal on beat4", they removed the crash (C) line's beat4. For instance, in an earlier example, when the user said "don't want cymbal on beat4", they changed the C line's fourth beat to dashes. So maybe in this case, the user meant to remove the crash (C) instead of ride (R). Since the user's current request is about ride, but the C line has the crash, perhaps it's a mistake, but I should follow the instruction as given.

Alternatively, perhaps the user mixed up crash and ride. But since I must follow the instruction, I'll proceed to edit the R line's beat4, but since it's already dashes, the output remains the same. However, that might be confusing for the user, so maybe I should point it out in the thought process but still provide the unchanged output as per their instruction.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended the R line to have something on beat4. Let me check if there's any ride in the provided example. The R line is all dashes. So the answer would be the same as the input. I'll proceed with that.
