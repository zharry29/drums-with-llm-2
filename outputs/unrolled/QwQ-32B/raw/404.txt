Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any snare or tom parts from the given groove. 

First, I need to look at the original groove provided. Let's break it down line by line:

**Original Groove:**
```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

The user's request is to eliminate the snare (S) and tom (T) parts. Let me check each line:

- **Kick (K):** This line is fine as it is. The user didn't mention removing kick, so we leave it untouched.
- **Snare (S):** The entire S line needs to be cleared. All characters except '-' should be replaced with '-'.
- **Hihat (H):** The user didn't mention removing hihat, so it stays. The H line has X and x characters, which are allowed since they're hihat hits.
- **Toms (T):** Already all '-' in the original, so no change needed here.
- **Crash (C) and Ride (R):** These are also not mentioned, so they stay as they are. In this case, both are empty except for some '-'.

Wait, let me double-check the S line. The original S has some hits like Oo-o and O--o. Removing those means replacing all non-'-' characters with '-'. So the S line becomes all '-'.

Similarly, the T line is already clear, so nothing to do there. The Hihat is okay unless the user also wanted that removed, but the request was only snare and toms. 

So the edited version should look like this:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Wait, but the user might have wanted to ensure that there's no snare at all. Let me confirm each part again. Yes, the S line is now all '-', and T remains empty. The kick and hihat are preserved. Crash and ride are still as original. Looks correct.
