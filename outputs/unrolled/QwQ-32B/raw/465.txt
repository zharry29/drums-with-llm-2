Okay, let's see. The user wants me to remove the hihat and snare from the given drum groove. Let me start by looking at the original groove provided.

First, I'll check each line to identify which instruments are present. The kick (K) has some hits, the snare (S) has hits on certain beats, the hihat (H) is doing X--- repeated, and the rest are empty except for the crash (C) and ride (R) which are inactive here.

The user's request is to eliminate both hihat and snare. So I need to set all the characters in the S and H lines to '-' since those are the lines for snare and hihat. Let me go through each line step by step.

Starting with the Kick (K): It's "O---|----|O---|----". Since the user didn't mention removing the kick, this stays as is.

Snare (S): Originally "----|O---|----|O---". Changing all non '-' characters to '-' so it becomes "----|----|----|----".

Hihat (H): Currently "X---|X---|X---|X---". Removing all hits, so it becomes "----|----|----|----".

Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R) are already empty except for maybe some parts, but looking at the original, they are all dashes. So no changes there.

Wait, let me double-check the original input to make sure I didn't miss any other instruments. The Toms line is all dashes, Crash and Ride are also inactive. So the only changes are to S and H lines.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have K remaining, and S and H cleared out. Let me format it properly with the @@@ delimiters as specified. Each line should maintain the 16 characters across four beats. Let me confirm the counts to ensure there's no mistake in the number of characters per line.

Yes, each line has four beats with four characters each, separated by |. So after editing, the S and H lines are all dashes. The final result should look like the example provided in previous similar edits. Alright, that should be it.
