Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any tom or snare parts from the given groove. Let me first look at the original groove provided.

Starting with the Kick (K line): "O---|O---|----|O---". That looks fine since it's just kick hits. The Snare (S) line has "----|----|O---|----", so I need to replace those O's with dashes. The Toms (T) line is "O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-", which I need to clear out by replacing all non-dash characters with dashes. The other lines (H, C, R) don't have any active hits except maybe the Hihat, but the user didn't mention removing those. Let me double-check the instructions again: "I don't want any tom or snare." So only S and T lines need to be modified. 

Wait, the Hihat (H) is okay unless specified, so leave that as is. Crash (C) and Ride (R) are also okay unless mentioned. Let me go through each line:

Original K: O---|O---|----|O--- → stays since it's kick, and user didn't mention kick removal.
Original S: ----|----|O---|---- → change the O--- in the third beat to ----.
Original T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o- → all dashes now.
H, C, R remain as they are unless they have toms or snares, but they don't. 

Wait, the user might have other elements, but according to the request, only tom and snare are to be removed. Let me confirm each line:

- K: Keep as is.
- S: Remove all snare hits (the O in the third beat).
- T: Remove all toms.
- H, C, R: Leave unless they have parts, but in the given groove, H is all dashes except maybe not? Wait, looking back at the original:

Wait, the user's given groove's H line is "----|----|----|----", so no hits there. So after editing, the S and T lines will be all dashes except where they were already. Let me write that out:

Final K: O---|O---|----|O---
Final S: ----|----|----|----
Final T: ----|----|----|----
H, C, R remain as they are (all dashes except maybe others, but in this case, they are all dashes). Wait, looking back, the original T line was "O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-", so changing that to all dashes. The rest are okay. 

I think that's all. Let me check again to ensure no snare or tom hits remain. Yep, S and T lines are cleared. The kick remains, and other instruments are untouched as per the request.
