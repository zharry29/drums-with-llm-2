Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to add a ride hit and hihat in the very beginning of the drum groove provided. Let me first look at the original groove to understand where to make changes.

The given drum groove is:

@@@
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The user's request is to have a ride hit and hihat in the very beginning. The "very beginning" probably refers to the first 16th note of the first beat, right? Let me check the notation again. Each line is divided into four beats separated by |, and each beat has four characters (16th notes). So the first beat is the first set before the first |.

Looking at the Ride (R) line: currently, it starts with "x---". The first character is an x, which according to the notation, for the ride cymbal, X and x are hard and soft closed hits on the bow. Since they want a ride hit in the beginning, maybe replacing the first x with an O or o to hit the bell. The user might prefer a hard hit, so using O would make sense here. So changing the first character of R's first beat from x to O would add a ride bell hit at the start.

Next, the hihat (H) line currently starts with "----", meaning no hit on the first 16th note. To add a hihat there, we need to put an articulation. The hihat can have O (hard open), o (soft open), X (hard closed), or x (soft closed). Since the first beat's hihat is usually closed in many grooves, maybe using X or x. But looking at the existing H line, the second beat has "x---", so maybe the user wants consistency. Alternatively, starting with a closed hit (X or x) would make sense. Let's go with X for a hard closed hit on the first note.

So, modifying the H line's first character from - to X, making it "X--x" for the first beat. Wait, original H is "----|x---|----|x---", so first beat is all dashes. Changing the first note to X would make the first beat "X---", then the second beat is "x---" as before. Wait, the user might want the hihat to start with a hit on the first note. Let me confirm the existing H line:

Original H: H: ----|x---|----|x---  
So first beat has no hits, second beat has x on the first 16th note. The user wants hihat in the very beginning, so first note of the first beat should have a hit. Let's put an X there. So first beat becomes "X---".

For the ride, the first note of the first beat in R is x (a closed bow hit), but the user wants a ride hit, which could be the bell. So replacing that x with O (hard bell hit) would add the requested ride hit.

So the modified lines would be:

R: O---|X-x-|x---|X-x-  
H: X---|x---|----|x---

Wait, but let me check the original R line again. The original R line is "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-". The first beat is "x---", so changing the first character to O makes it "O---".

Therefore, the final edited groove would have these changes. Let me make sure I didn't affect other parts. The user didn't mention changing anything else, so the rest should stay the same. Let me double-check the other lines to ensure no mistakes. The kick (K) and snare (S) remain as they are, and the toms (T) and crash (C) are still empty. 

So putting it all together, the edited drum groove should look like this:

@@@
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
S: ----|X---|--X-|----  
H: X---|x---|----|x---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: O---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

I think that's it. The first note of the first beat now has a ride bell hit (O) and a closed hihat (X), fulfilling the user's request.
