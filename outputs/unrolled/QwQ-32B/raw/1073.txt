Alright, so the user wants to make this drum groove sound more disco. Let me think about what defines a disco beat. Disco usually has a strong, syncopated rhythm with a prominent hi-hat pattern and a four-on-the-floor kick. The snare is typically on the backbeat, like beats 2 and 4.

Looking at the original groove:

K: O---|----|O---|---- (Kick on 1 and 3)
S: ----|O---|----|O--- (Snare on 2 and 4)
H: X---|X---|X---|X--- (Closed hi-hat on every beat)
T, C, R: All silent.

Hmm, the kick is only on beats 1 and 3, which is a bit sparse for disco. Disco often uses the "four-on-the-floor" kick where the kick is on every beat. Also, the hi-hat is closed on every beat, but in disco, open hi-hats on the off-beats can add that swing. Maybe adding some open hi-hats on the '+' of each beat would help.

Also, the snare is straightforward on 2 and 4. Maybe adding some ghost notes or a more syncopated pattern on the snare could add flair. Oh, and the ride or crash could be used to add some shimmer. Let's see:

First, the kick: Change it to hit every beat. So instead of O---|----|O---|----, make it O---|O---|O---|O---. But wait, the user might want to keep some space. Alternatively, maybe O---|----|O---|---- but with more subdivisions. Wait, the original has kick on 1 and 3. To make it four-on-the-floor, kick on every downbeat. Let me adjust that.

Next, the hi-hat: Instead of closed on every beat, maybe closed on the beats and open on the 'ands'. So like X-x- repeated. That would give that classic disco hi-hat feel.

Snare: Maybe add some ghost notes (soft hits) on the off-beats. So between the snare hits on 2 and 4, add some 'o's. For example, between the snare on beat 2, maybe a ghost note on the 'and' of 1.

Also, adding a crash on the first beat to start it off would give that disco flair. So C: O---|----|----|----

Let me structure this step by step.

Original Kick: O on 1 and 3. Change to four-on-the-floor: O on every beat. So K: O--- repeated four times.

Hi-hat: X--- on each beat. Change to X-x- for each beat, so X-x-|X-x-| etc.

Snare: Original has O on 2 and 4. Add ghost notes (o) on the 'and' of 1 and 3. So maybe in the first beat, between the kick on 1 and the snare on 2, add an 'o' on the '+' of 1. So something like -o-O- for the first beat? Wait, each beat is four 16th notes. Let me think in 16th notes. Each bar has four beats, each beat has four 16th notes. So for the first measure:

Beat 1: 1, 2, 3, 4 (16th notes). The kick is on the first 16th (O---). The snare is on the second beat (beat 2). To add a ghost note before the snare hit, maybe on the '+' of beat 1 (the third 16th note of the first beat?), but need to fit into the notation.

Alternatively, in the first beat of the first measure (O---), maybe the snare ghost note would be on the third 16th note. Let me see:

Original S line is ----|O---|----|O---. So in the second beat (where the snare is on 2), the snare is on the first 16th of that beat. To add a ghost note before, maybe on the fourth 16th of the previous beat? Or the third?

Wait, each beat is four 16th notes. So the first beat (beat 1) has four 16ths. The second beat (beat 2) starts at the fifth 16th. The snare is on the first 16th of beat 2. To add a ghost note on the '+' of beat 1 (the 'and' of beat 1), that would be the third 16th of beat 1. So in the first beat's S line, the third character would be 'o'.

So for the first measure's S line:

First beat (beat 1): -o-- (so the third 16th is a ghost note). Then the second beat has the snare on the first 16th, so O---. So combining, the first two beats would be -o--|O---. But the original has ----|O---. So changing the first beat's third 16th to 'o'.

Similarly, before the snare on beat 4, add a ghost note on the '+' of beat 3.

So the S line would become something like:

-o--|O---|-o--|O--- but need to check each beat.

Wait, let's structure it properly. Let me write each beat as four characters.

Original S line: "----|O---|----|O---"

Breaking it down per beat:

Beat 1: ---- (no snare)
Beat 2: O--- (snare on first 16th)
Beat 3: ----
Beat 4: O---

To add ghost notes before the snare hits on beats 2 and 4:

Before beat 2 (which is the second beat), the ghost note would be on the third 16th of beat 1 (the '+ of 1'). So beat 1's third 16th becomes 'o', making beat 1: -o--

Similarly, before beat 4 (the fourth beat), the ghost note is on the third 16th of beat 3. So beat 3 would be -o--

Thus, the S line becomes:

-o--|O---|-o--|O---

But maybe also adding another ghost note between the snare hits. Alternatively, maybe a more syncopated pattern.

Alternatively, adding a ghost note on the 'and of 3' before the snare on 4, so beat 3 would have -o--.

So the S line would be:

-o--|O---|-o--|O---

Additionally, maybe adding a ghost note on the '+' of 2 and 4? Hmm, but that might complicate. Let's stick with the above for simplicity.

Now, the hi-hat. Original is X--- on each beat. Changing to X-x- for each beat, which is closed on the beat, then open on the '+'.

So H line would be X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

Also, adding a crash on the first beat to start with a crash. So C: O---|----|----|----

Putting it all together:

K: O---|O---|O---|O--- (four-on-the-floor kick)
S: -o--|O---|-o--|O--- (ghost notes before snare hits)
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x- (disco hi-hat)
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ---- (no ride, unless we add some)

Wait, maybe the ride could have some closed hits on the off-beats? Alternatively, leaving it as is. The crash on the first beat adds the disco flair.

Let me check if that's enough. The kick is steady on every beat, the hi-hat has that swing, and the snare has ghost notes. That should sound more disco.

Wait, but the original H line was X--- on each beat. The X is a closed hit. Changing to X-x- means closed on the beat, open on the '+'.

Yes, that's a classic disco hi-hat pattern. So that should work.

So the final groove would look like:

K: O---|O---|O---|O---
S: -o--|O---|-o--|O---
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

But let me check the original user's edit request again: "I'd like it to sound more disco."

Another thing in disco is the use of the ride or crash. Maybe adding a crash on the first beat and then every other bar? Or just the first.

Also, maybe the snare could have more activity. Alternatively, adding a snare ghost note on the '+' of 2 and 4 as well? But that might be overkill. Let's see:

Alternatively, making the snare line have more ghost notes, like -o-O- on beats 2 and 4. Wait, but the snare is only on beats 2 and 4. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the snare could have a "para-did" pattern, but that might be too much. Let's stick with the ghost notes before the main snare hits.

Alternatively, maybe adding a ghost note on the '+' of 3 as well, but the user might prefer simplicity.

I think the above changes should suffice. Let me format it properly with the | separators.

Each line is four beats, each beat four characters.

K: O---|O---|O---|O---
S: -o--|O---|-o--|O---
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, that should work. The four-on-the-floor kick, the swung hi-hat, and the ghost notes on the snare add that disco feel. The crash on the first beat gives it an energetic start.
