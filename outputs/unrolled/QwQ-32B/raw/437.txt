Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the kick and ride from the given groove. 

First, I'll look at the original groove provided:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user's request is to eliminate any kick (K) and ride (R) parts. 

Starting with the Kick (K line): The current K line has hits in the first, second, and fourth beats. To remove the kick, I'll replace all the O's and o's in the K line with dashes (-), making it all dashes.

Next, the Ride (R line): The R line is already all dashes, so no changes are needed there. But I should double-check to ensure there's no accidental ride hits. Since it's all dashes, it's already compliant.

Now, check the other instruments to make sure they stay as they are. The Snare (S) has hits on the third and fourth beats of the third and fourth measures. The Toms (T) have a repeating pattern across all measures. The Hihat (H) and Crash (C) are inactive here, so they stay empty.

Wait, the user only mentioned removing kick and ride. The toms (T) are okay to stay unless specified otherwise. Since the user didn't mention toms, we leave them. Let me confirm the original T line is O-o- repeating. That's fine.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have K and R lines empty, others unchanged. Let me write that out:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I think that's it. Let me double-check each line. Kick is all dashes. Ride is empty. Snare and Toms remain as they were. No typos in the characters. Looks good!
