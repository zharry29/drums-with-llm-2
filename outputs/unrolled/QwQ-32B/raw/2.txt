Okay, so I need to add some tom hits to this drum groove. Let me first look at the existing groove to understand where I can fit the toms in without clashing too much.

The given groove is:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Hmm, the Toms line already has O-o- repeating in each beat. That's four beats with each beat having a hard hit on the first 16th note and a soft hit on the third. Wait, actually, each beat is four characters, so "O-o-" would mean first note hard, then two rests, then soft? Wait, no. Wait each beat is four characters, so "O-o-" would be the first character is O, second -, third o, fourth -, but that can't be. Wait, the T line is written as "O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-", so each beat is "O - o -", right? Because each beat is four characters separated by |. So each beat is first 16th note is O (hard), second -, third o (soft), fourth -. So that's a pattern every beat: hit on the first and third 16th notes, but with hard and soft.

The user wants to add more tom to the groove. So maybe I can add more hits, or vary the articulation? Or maybe add some in the other beats where there's space?

Looking at the other instruments:

Kick drum (K) is hitting on the first 16th of each beat in the first and second beats, then the fourth beat's first 16th. The third beat's kick is rest. The snare (S) is only on the third beat's first 16th (O) and the fourth beat is rest. The hihat (H) is all rests. Ride and crash are also rests.

So the existing tom part is a steady pattern, but maybe adding some variation would make it more interesting. The user says "add some tom", so maybe adding more hits, or changing some of the existing ones to be harder or softer, or adding in different positions?

Alternatively, maybe layer some tom hits in addition to the existing ones. Let me see.

First, let's look at each beat:

First beat (positions 1-4): K hits on 1, tom has O on 1 and o on 3. Maybe add a tom hit on 2 or 4? But need to see if that fits with the kick and snare. Since kick is on 1, adding a tom on 2 might be okay. Alternatively, maybe on 4? But the next beat starts at 5.

Second beat (positions 5-8): K hits on 5, tom O on 5, o on 7. Similarly, maybe add a tom on 6 or 8.

Third beat (positions 9-12): K is rest, tom has O on 9 and o on 11. Since there's a snare on 9 (third beat's first 16th?), wait the snare is on the third beat's first 16th. Wait the snare line is S: ----|----|O---|----, so third beat's first note is O (snare hit). So third beat's first 16th is snare and tom O. Maybe that's okay. Adding another tom hit here?

Fourth beat (positions 13-16): K hits on 13, tom has O on 13 and o on 15. The snare is on the fourth beat's... looking at S's fourth beat: "----", so snare is rest. So maybe add a tom hit on 14 or 16.

Alternatively, maybe in the hihat or ride, but the user specified adding tom. Let's focus on T.

The existing tom pattern is O - o - | repeated. So each beat has two hits, first and third. To add more, perhaps add another hit in each beat, or in some beats.

Alternatively, maybe in the first and third beats, add a hit on the second 16th note. Let's try.

For example, in the first beat, instead of O - o -, maybe O O o -, but that might be too busy. Alternatively, O - o O? Hmm, maybe. But the existing pattern is O-o-, so maybe changing some of the rests to hits.

Alternatively, perhaps adding a harder hit on some of the existing o's to make them O, but that's changing articulation. The user said "add some tom", so adding more notes.

Alternatively, maybe in the third beat, since there's a snare on the first 16th, perhaps adding a tom on the second or fourth?

Wait, let's think of the structure. The kick is on beats 1, 2 (first two beats), then 4. The snare is on beat 3. So maybe the third beat is the snare hit, so the tom could play along with that.

Alternatively, maybe in the fourth beat, which has kick on 13, adding a tom on 14 or 16.

Another idea: the existing tom has a pattern that's every other 16th note, but starting on 1. Maybe shift some hits to offbeats.

Alternatively, maybe in the first beat, add a tom on the second 16th (position 2), so O O o -, but need to check if that's too much.

Alternatively, in the first beat, keep O - o -, but in the second beat, maybe O - O -, making the third note a hard hit instead of soft. Hmm, but that's changing articulation.

Alternatively, let's try adding some hits in the third and fourth beats. For example, in the third beat (positions 9-12), which has O on 9 and o on 11. Maybe add a tom on 10 or 12. Let's say adding a soft hit on 10 (position 10): so the third beat's tom would be O o o -, but wait the original was O - o -. So changing to O o o - would add a hit on the second 16th. Alternatively, O - o O on the fourth 16th. Not sure.

Alternatively, in the fourth beat, add a tom on the fourth 16th (position 16). So changing the fourth beat's tom from O - o - to O - o O.

Alternatively, maybe in the first and third beats, add a tom on the fourth 16th. Let me see:

First beat: O - o -, adding a hit on the fourth 16th (position 4): O - o O. But the kick is on 1, so that might be okay.

Third beat: O - o -, adding a hit on position 12 (fourth note of third beat): O - o O.

Similarly, second beat: O - o -, adding a hit on position 8 (fourth note of second beat): O - o O.

Fourth beat: O - o -, adding a hit on position 16: O - o O.

This way, each beat's tom pattern becomes O - o O, adding a hit on the fourth 16th. That might give a more driving feel.

Alternatively, maybe make it O O o -, adding a hit on the second 16th.

Alternatively, let's see what the user did in the previous examples. In the first user example, when adding toms, they placed Os and Os in different positions. Like in the first example, they added T: --O-|-O--|--O-|--O- which spread out the hits.

Alternatively, maybe in the current problem, since the existing toms are every first and third 16th, adding some on the second and fourth would create a different rhythm.

Alternatively, perhaps changing some of the existing o's to O's for harder hits, but the user wants to add more, so maybe more notes.

Let me try modifying the tom line to add hits on the second and fourth 16ths in some beats. For instance, in the first beat, O O o O. But that might be too busy. Let's see:

Original T line: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

If I add a hit on the second 16th of each beat (changing the second - to O or o), maybe:

First beat: O O o -, but that's O-O-o-? Wait, each beat is four characters. So first beat would be O (1), then O (2), o (3), - (4). That might work. Alternatively, using O for harder hits.

Alternatively, maybe in the first and third beats, add a hit on the second 16th, and in the second and fourth beats, add on the fourth.

Alternatively, let's try:

T: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O- but that would mean every second 16th is hit. But original has O on first and o on third. So combining, that would be O (1), O (2), o (3), O (4). Hmm, maybe that's too much.

Alternatively, maybe in the first beat: O - o O (adding a hit on fourth), second beat: O - o O, etc. So each beat ends with a tom hit. That would be T: O-o-O|O-o-O|O-o-O|O-o-O. But each beat is four characters, so O-o-O would need to be four characters. Wait, O-o- is four characters (O, -, o, -). To add an O on the fourth, it would be O-o-O, but that's four characters? Wait, O-o-O would be O, -, o, O? Wait, no. Let's clarify:

Each beat is four characters. The original is "O-o-" which is O (1st), - (2nd), o (3rd), - (4th). To add a hit on the 4th, it would be O - o O. So the beat becomes "O-oO" but need to check the notation. The characters can be O, o, or -, so "O-oO" is allowed.

So modifying each beat to have O - o O would make the tom part more active. Let's try that:

T: O-oO|O-oO|O-oO|O-oO

But is that too much? Alternatively, maybe only in some beats.

Alternatively, maybe alternate between adding on the second and fourth.

Alternatively, maybe in the first and third beats, add a hit on the second, and in the second and fourth, add on the fourth.

So first beat: O O o -, second beat: O - o O, third beat: O O o -, fourth beat: O - o O.

Resulting in:

T: O-O-|O-oO|O-O-|O-oO

But that's uneven. Maybe better to make it consistent.

Alternatively, maybe add a tom hit on the fourth 16th of each beat, so each beat is O - o O.

So T: O-oO|O-oO|O-oO|O-oO.

That would be four hits per beat (1,3,4?), but the original had two. This adds two more hits per beat, making it busier. Maybe that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe only add in some beats. For example, in the third and fourth beats, add the fourth hit.

Alternatively, let's check the other instruments. The kick is hitting on 1,5,13. The snare is on 9. So adding tom on the fourth 16th (beat 4's fourth is 16th note 16, which is the end of the bar). Maybe that's a good place.

Alternatively, let's try another approach. Since the existing tom is O-o- repeated, maybe add some variation in the third and fourth beats. For instance, in the third beat, which has a snare hit on 9, maybe have the tom play O - O - (so hard on 9 and hard on 11?), but replacing the o with O. Or maybe add an extra hit.

Alternatively, in the third beat's tom line, instead of O - o -, do O - O -, making it O-O--? Wait that would be first hit hard, second -, third hard, fourth -. That could work.

Similarly, in the fourth beat, maybe O - O -.

So modifying the third and fourth beats:

Original T line was O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

Modified to:

O-o-|O-o-|O-O-|O-O-

So third beat: O - O -, fourth beat: O - O -

This adds a harder hit on the third 16th of third and fourth beats instead of the soft. That might add some variation.

Alternatively, perhaps adding a tom hit on the second 16th of the first and third beats. Like first beat: O O o -, third beat: O O o -.

So T: O-O-|O-o-|O-O-|O-o-

But then the second and fourth beats stay as original.

Alternatively, combining these ideas, but I need to make sure it's clear.

Alternatively, maybe in the first beat, add a tom on the second 16th (so O O o -), second beat same as before, third beat add on the second (O O o -), fourth beat add on fourth (O - o O). Not sure.

Alternatively, let's look at the previous user examples. In the first user example, when adding toms, they spread them across the bar, like in the first example the tom line became --O-|-O--|--O-|--O- which is spaced out.

In the second example, the user added T: O---|--O-|O---|--O- which is also spaced.

So maybe the user prefers spacing out the tom hits rather than making them too dense.

In the current problem, the existing tom is every first and third 16th. To add more without making it too busy, perhaps adding some on the second and fourth in some beats.

Alternatively, maybe in the first beat, add a tom on the fourth 16th (position 4), so O - o O. Then in the second beat, add on the fourth (position 8), so O - o O. Third beat add on the second (position 10?), no, third beat's second is position 10. Wait third beat is positions 9-12, so second is 10. Maybe add there. Fourth beat add on the fourth (position 16). So:

First beat: O-oO

Second beat: O-oO

Third beat: O-O- (adding a hit on second 16th, position 10)

Fourth beat: O-oO

So T: O-oO|O-oO|O-O-|O-oO

This way, the tom has added hits on the fourth of first and second beats, second of third, and fourth of fourth. That might spread it out.

Alternatively, maybe in the third beat, adding a hit on the fourth (position 12), so third beat would be O - o O, same as others.

Alternatively, let me try writing this out step by step.

Original T line:

Beat 1: O - o -

Beat 2: O - o -

Beat 3: O - o -

Beat 4: O - o -

Adding a hit on the fourth 16th in beats 1 and 2:

Beat1: O - o O

Beat2: O - o O

Beat3: O - o O

Beat4: O - o O

So T: O-oO|O-oO|O-oO|O-oO

This would add a tom on every fourth 16th note, making it four hits per beat (1,3,4). But maybe that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe alternate between adding on second and fourth.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to keep the existing pattern and add some extra hits in different places.

Alternatively, maybe in the third beat, since there's a snare hit on the first 16th, the tom could have a harder hit there as well, but the existing tom already has O on the first. So maybe that's okay.

Alternatively, adding some soft hits (o) in between. For example, in the first beat, between the existing O and o, add an o on the second 16th: O o o -.

Wait, but that would be O-o- becomes O o o -, which is three hits in the beat. Maybe that's acceptable.

Alternatively, let's try this:

T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o- (original) plus adding some O's in other positions.

Alternatively, I think the best approach is to add some tom hits on the offbeats (second and fourth 16ths) in some beats to add variation. Since the existing pattern is on the downbeats and the "and" of the beat (third 16th?), maybe adding on the "e" or "a" (second and fourth).

Let me try the first option of adding the fourth 16th in each beat, making it O-oO for each beat. That would give a consistent addition.

So the new T line would be:

T: O-oO|O-oO|O-oO|O-oO

Let me check that each beat is four characters. "O-oO" is four characters: O, -, o, O. Yes. So each beat would be:

Beat1: O - o O

Beat2: O - o O

Beat3: O - o O

Beat4: O - o O

This adds a tom hit on the fourth 16th of each beat, which is the end of each beat. That might give a nice driving feel, especially with the kick on the first of beats 1,2,4 and the snare on beat3.

Alternatively, maybe the fourth beat's last hit (position16) could be a crash or ride, but the user specified adding toms. So that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe in the fourth beat, instead of O on the fourth, a soft hit o?

But the user said "add some tom", so more notes. The existing pattern has two notes per beat, this would add one more, making three per beat. That's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants more variation. Let me think of another approach.

Another idea: the existing tom is O-o- in each beat. Maybe in the third beat (where snare is), add a tom hit on the second 16th (position10) to play with the snare. So third beat becomes O O o -.

Fourth beat could add a hit on the second and fourth: O O o O.

So T: O-o-|O-o-|O-O-|O-OO ?

Wait, let's see:

Beat3: O (9), then O (10), o (11), - (12). That's O-O-o-.

Beat4: O (13), then O (14), o (15), O (16). O-O-oO.

Hmm, but maybe that's too much. Alternatively, O - O O for beat4?

Alternatively, let's see the kick and snare to avoid clashing too much. The kick is on 1,5,13. The snare on 9.

In beat3 (positions9-12), the kick is not hitting, so adding a tom on 10 (position10) is okay with the snare on9.

So third beat's tom: O (9), -, O (11?), wait no. Wait in the existing third beat's tom is O on9 and o on11. If I add a hit on 10, it would be O (9), then hit on 10 (O or o?), then o on11, then rest.

Alternatively, O-Oo- for beat3: O on9, O on10, o on11, - on12. That might be okay.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest is adding the fourth 16th hit in each beat as I first thought.

Alternatively, maybe the user's previous examples added toms in a way that they're spaced every few beats. Let me check the first user example again.

In the first problem, the original tom had T: ----|----|-O--|---o. The user added T: --O-|-O--|--O-|--O-.

So they spread the tom hits every other beat, adding O's in different positions.

In the second problem, the original had T: ----|----|----|----, and the user added T: O---|--O-|O---|--O-.

So starting with an O on the first 16th of first beat, then O on second beat's second 16th, etc.

In this current problem, the existing tom is active in all four beats with O-o- each. So maybe the user wants to add more variation, perhaps adding some O's in different positions.

Alternatively, maybe adding a tom hit on the second 16th of each beat, so changing the second '-' to 'O' or 'o'.

So modifying each beat's second character to O, making it O O o -.

So T: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O-.

This would give a hit on 1,2,3 in each beat, which is three hits per beat. That might be a bit busy, but could work.

Alternatively, alternating between adding on second and fourth.

Alternatively, let's try this:

T: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O-.

But let's see how it sounds with the kick and snare.

First beat: tom hits 1,2,3. Kick is on1, so okay.

Second beat: same, kick on5 (first 16th of second beat is 5?), so tom on5 and 6 and7.

Third beat: tom on9,10,11. Snare on9, so tom and snare on9 is okay.

Fourth beat: tom on13,14,15. Kick on13, so okay.

This might be okay, but maybe a bit busy.

Alternatively, perhaps adding some soft hits. For example, in the second character use 'o' instead of 'O' to make it softer.

T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o- (original) plus adding on second 16th as 'o' would make O-o o -, but that's three hits.

Alternatively, maybe in some beats, add a hit on the fourth.

Hmm, this is taking a while. Let me decide on a plan.

Since the user's previous answers added toms in a pattern that moves around the bar, maybe I should add some toms in different positions in each beat. For example:

First beat: add a tom on the fourth 16th (O-oO)

Second beat: add a tom on the second 16th (O-O-)

Third beat: add a tom on the fourth 16th (O-oO)

Fourth beat: add a tom on the second and fourth (O-O O)

Wait, but need to keep it simple.

Alternatively:

First beat: O - o O

Second beat: O O o -

Third beat: O - o O

Fourth beat: O O - O

This way, each beat has different additions.

Alternatively, let's try the following:

T: O-oO | O-O- | O-oO | O-O-

This way:

Beat1: O - o O

Beat2: O O - - (Wait no, O-O- is O, O, -, -? Wait O-O- is first O, second O, third -, fourth -? That might not be better.

Alternatively, O-O- would be O on1, O on2, then rest.

Hmm, maybe the best approach is to add a tom hit on the fourth 16th of each beat, resulting in:

T: O-oO|O-oO|O-oO|O-oO

This is consistent and adds a hit at the end of each beat's fourth 16th, which might complement the kick and snare.

Alternatively, let's check the other instruments. The ride and crash are all rests, so the toms can be more prominent.

Another consideration: the existing tom's soft hit on the third 16th. Adding a hard hit on the fourth might add a nice punch.

Alternatively, maybe in the fourth beat, instead of a hard hit on the fourth, a soft 'o' would be better, but the user said "add", so any hit is okay.

Alright, I'll go with adding the fourth 16th hit in each beat as a hard O. So the new T line is:

T: O-oO|O-oO|O-oO|O-oO

Let me write that out in the full notation.

Original K and S lines remain the same, H is still all rests, C and R too.

So the final edited groove would be:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-oO|O-oO|O-oO|O-oO
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, but each beat in the T line must be four characters separated by |. So each beat is "O-oO", which is four characters (O, -, o, O). Yes.

So the final answer should be between the @@@:

@@@
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-oO|O-oO|O-oO|O-oO
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

But wait, let me double-check the notation rules. Each character is a 16th note, and each beat is four characters. The T line as written would have in each beat:

Beat1: O (1), - (2), o (3), O (4)

Beat2: same

Beat3: same

Beat4: same

That seems okay. Alternatively, maybe the user expects some variation, but this is a valid approach.
