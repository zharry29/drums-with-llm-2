Okay, let's see. The user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing any cymbals and snare. The original groove is given, and I need to make sure that the S (snare) and C (crash), R (ride) lines are all dashes. Let me look at the given drum notation first.

The original groove has:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

First, the user says "no cymbal or snare". Cymbals include Crash (C) and Ride (R). Snare is S. So I need to set all S, C, R lines to all '-'.

Looking at the S line: the third beat has 'S---', so I need to replace that with '----'.

The C line has all 'O---' in each beat, so that should become '----|----|----|----'.

The R line is already all dashes, so no change there.

The kick (K) and toms (T) and hihat (H) can stay as they are unless specified otherwise. The user didn't mention those, so leave them.

Wait, the user's request is only about removing cymbals (C and R) and snare (S). So confirm:

- S line should be all dashes.
- C line should be all dashes.
- R is already okay.

Let me reconstruct each line:

K remains: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S becomes: ----|----|----|----
H stays: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T stays: ----|----|---O|----
C becomes: ----|----|----|----
R stays: ----|----|----|----

Wait, checking the original R line, it was all dashes already. So the main changes are in S and C lines. That should satisfy the request. Let me make sure there are no other cymbals or snare hits. The S line had an 'S' in the third beat's first hit, so replacing that with '-' is correct. The crash line (C) had all 'O's, so those become dashes. The final groove should look like this with those changes.
