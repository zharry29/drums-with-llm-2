Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any hihat (H) and snare (S) parts from the given groove. Let me start by carefully looking at the original notation they provided.

First, I need to parse each line of the drum groove. The given groove is:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user's request is to eliminate both the snare (S) and hihat (H) components. So my task is to go through each line and set S and H lines to all '-' characters, effectively silencing those instruments. The other instruments (Kick, Toms, Crash, Ride) should remain as they are unless they're also mentioned in the request, which they aren't here.

Starting with the Kick (K) line: It has some O and - characters. Since the user didn't mention Kick, I leave it untouched.

Next, the Snare (S) line has various hits like Oo-o and -o--. I need to replace all these with '-' so that the snare is completely silent.

Then the Hihat (H) line has X-x- repeated. Since the user wants no hihat, I'll replace all those X and x with '-'.

The Toms (T) line is already all '-', so no change needed there. Similarly, Crash (C) and Ride (R) are also silent, so they stay as is.

Wait a second, let me double-check each line to ensure I didn't miss anything. The S line definitely has some soft hits (o) and maybe a mix, but the user wants none of that. The H line's X and x are closed and open hits, but since the instruction is to remove hihat entirely, all those should be replaced.

So after editing, the S line becomes all '-', and the H line also becomes all '-'. The rest remain the same. Let me reconstruct the lines accordingly.

Let me also confirm that there are no other instruments involved. The user's request was specifically about hihat and snare, so the other lines should stay. Let me make sure there are 16 characters in each line (including the | separators) to maintain the bar structure.

Original S line: "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o" becomes "----|----|----|----".

Original H line: "X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-" becomes "----|----|----|----".

Yes, that looks right. The final groove should have the K, T, C, R lines unchanged, and S and H lines all '-'.

I think that's all. Let me write out the final answer in the required format.
