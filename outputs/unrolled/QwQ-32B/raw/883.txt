Okay, so I need to figure out how to "feather the kick drum" in the given drum groove. Let me start by recalling what feathering means in a drumming context. From what I know, feathering a drum hit typically means playing it very softly, often with the tip of the stick instead of a full hit. But since the kick drum is a pedal-driven drum, maybe it refers to playing it more subtly or with a lighter touch? Alternatively, feathering could mean spacing out the hits more, making them lighter in volume. 

Looking at the notation rules provided, the kick drum (K line) uses O for a hard hit and o for a soft hit. The original groove has the kick on the first and third beats of each bar, which in the given notation are represented as "O---" and "O---". Each beat is four 16th notes, so the first character in each beat is the downbeat.

The user wants to feather the kick, so perhaps replacing the hard hits (O) with soft hits (o) would make sense. That would directly translate to a softer sound. Alternatively, maybe distributing the hits more evenly or adding more notes? But since the instruction is to "feather", softening the existing hits seems more likely.

Let me check the example provided in the problem. The original K line is:

K: O---|----|O---|----

So in beats 1 and 3, there's a hard kick on the downbeat. To feather, changing those O's to o's would make them softer. That would give:

K: o---|----|o---|----

But maybe the user wants more than just softening? The term "feathering" sometimes implies a more intricate pattern, but given the kick drum's role here, maybe it's just about the velocity. Since the user didn't mention adding more notes, I'll go with softening the existing hits.

Wait, but let me think again. Another interpretation of feathering the kick might involve subdividing the beats into 16th notes with lighter hits. For example, instead of hitting only on the downbeat, maybe adding hits on the "and" or other subdivisions but softly. However, the original kick is only on beats 1 and 3, so if I spread them out, that could be feathering. But the user might just want the existing hits to be softer.

Looking at previous interactions, when users asked to avoid snare on downbeats, the assistant shifted the snare hits to the offbeats. Here, since the instruction is to feather the kick, and given the notation's options, replacing O with o is the most straightforward approach. Let me confirm the notation's rules again for the kick: O is hard, o is soft. So changing O to o would indeed feather the kick.

Therefore, the edited K line should be:

K: o---|----|o---|----

But let me check if there's another way. Maybe adding more o's in between? For example, making it a run of 16th notes with soft hits? But the original has only two hits. The user might just want those existing hits to be softer. Since there's no mention of changing the rhythm, I'll stick with softening the existing hits.

So the final answer would replace the O's in the kick line with o's.
