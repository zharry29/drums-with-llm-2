Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the snare and tom parts from the given groove. First, I need to recall which lines correspond to which instruments. 

Looking at the given groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user specified "no snare or tom," so I need to set the S (snare) and T (toms) lines to all dashes. Let me check each line:

- **Kick (K)** stays as is since it's allowed.
- **Snare (S)** has hits in the third and fourth beats. I'll replace all characters in S's line with '-'.
- **Hihat (H)** is already empty, so no change.
- **Toms (T)** have O-o- repeating. I'll replace all those with '-'.
- **Crash (C)** and **Ride (R)** are already empty, so they stay.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other instruments. The user didn't mention crash or ride, so those can stay as they are. The main task is to zero out the S and T lines. Let me rewrite each line accordingly.

After editing, the S line becomes all dashes, and T becomes all dashes. The rest remain the same. Let me double-check the structure to ensure each line has 16 characters separated by | into four beats. Looks like it should fit.
