Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to include not only ride but also tom. Looking at the given groove:

The Kick (K) and Snare (S) lines are all dashes, meaning they're not playing. The Hihat (H) has some x's on the 1st and 3rd beats. The Toms (T) and Crash (C) are silent. The Ride (R) has a pattern with x and X on beats 1 and 3. 

The problem is that currently, there are no toms (T line is empty) and the ride is present. The edit request says "not only ride but also tom", so we need to add toms without removing the ride. 

First, I'll need to add some tom hits. Since the existing groove has a sparse structure (only hihat and ride), adding toms on certain beats can add depth. Let's look at the existing ride pattern to sync with it. The ride is playing on every 16th note but with varying articulations. 

Maybe add toms on the beats where the hihat is hitting. For example, the hihat hits on the first 16th of beat 2 and beat 4. So maybe put a tom hit there. Alternatively, since the user might want a more rhythmic tom part, maybe add a tom on every other beat. Let's try placing tom hits on beats 1 and 3. Since the kick is silent, maybe the toms can take over some of the bassline. 

Alternatively, since the ride is active, maybe the toms can complement it. Let's see:

Original R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-  
So the ride is playing on the first 16th of each beat, then on the 3rd 16th of beats 2 and 4. 

Maybe add toms on the offbeats. Let's try:

In the Toms line, perhaps add O (hard hit) on the second 16th of each beat. Like -O--| -O-- etc. That would create a syncopated tom pattern. Alternatively, align with the hihat. Since hihat is on the first 16th of beat 2 and 4, maybe put a tom there. 

Wait, the hihat is at positions 2-1 and 4-1 (beat 2 first 16th, beat 4 first 16th). So T could have O on those spots. Also, maybe on beat 3's first 16th? 

Alternatively, to make it more interesting, maybe a tom on every beat but with soft hits. Let's try:

T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O- (so every third 16th note). But need to check the total length. Each line has 16 characters divided into 4 beats (4 per beat). Let me structure it properly.

Wait, each line is divided into four beats with four characters each. So for Toms:

Starting with beat 1: four characters. Let me think step by step.

The user's current T line is all dashes. Need to add some O or o. Since the user might prefer a steady tom part, maybe a tom on the 3rd 16th of each beat? Like -O-- repeated. So:

T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--

Alternatively, to match the ride's pattern, maybe on the 2nd and 4th 16ths. For example:

T: --O-|---O|--O-|---O but that might be too scattered. Alternatively, start with beat 1: first 16th hit, but that would conflict with the ride's x on first 16th. 

Alternatively, place toms on the offbeats where there's space. Since the ride is on the first 16th of each beat, maybe the toms can hit on the third 16th (like the second part of the beat). Let's try:

For each beat, the third 16th: so positions 3,7,11,15 (since each beat is 4 characters). So in each beat's four characters, the third character is O. So each beat's T line would be -O-- (since first three 16ths: first is -, second -, third O, fourth -). Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Each beat is four characters. For example, the first beat's T line would be four characters. If we want the third 16th note of the beat to have a tom hit, that would be the third character in the four. So for each beat:

Beat 1: - - O - â†’ "-O--"

So the T line would be:

T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--

This would create a tom hit on the third 16th of each beat. That might work. 

Alternatively, maybe a tom on every other beat. Let's see. 

Another approach: since the hihat is on the first 16th of beats 2 and 4, maybe the toms can hit on the third 16th of those beats. 

But to ensure the toms are present throughout, maybe the first approach of consistent -O-- per beat is better. 

Also, need to check if the user's previous examples used O or o. Since the instruction says "not only ride but also tom," adding at least some tom hits. 

So, modifying the T line to -O-- for each beat. That would give:

T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--

Additionally, the ride is already present, so that's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe a softer hit (o) for a more subtle sound. Let's see the original groove's ride uses x and X, so maybe O for toms to contrast. 

Putting it all together, the edited groove would have the Toms line filled with -O-- in each beat segment, and keep the Ride as is. 

Wait, let me check the original given groove again:

Original given:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

So the Hihat hits on the first 16th of beat 2 and 4. 

If I add toms on the third 16th of each beat, that would be:

T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--

So in beat 1: third 16th has a tom hit. Beat 2's third 16th as well. 

This should add tom hits without conflicting with existing elements. 

Alternatively, maybe add a tom on the same beats as the hihat but an octave lower? Like on beat 2's first 16th, but that would be on the same timing as the hihat. Maybe that's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe a tom on the second beat's third 16th, but the first approach is more consistent. 

I think the first approach is better. Let me structure the final answer accordingly.
