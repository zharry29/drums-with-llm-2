Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the ride and hihat parts. First, I need to look at the original groove they provided. 

Starting with the K (Kick drum line): "O---|---o|O-O-|----". That looks fine, but I need to check if there's any mention of ride or hihat here. No, kick is separate. 

Next, the S (Snare): "----|O---|----|O---". Snare is okay, no ride or hihat involved here.

Now, H (Hihat) is "--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-". Since the user wants no hihat, I need to replace all those characters with '-' to silence them.

Then, T (Toms) is empty, so that's fine. C (Crash) has "O---|----|----|----", which is allowed unless the user also wanted crashes removed, but the request was specifically ride and hihat. So crashes stay.

R (Ride cymbal) is empty in the original, but maybe the user is cautious. Wait, looking again, the original R line is "----|----|----|----", so no ride being played. But maybe there was a mistake? The user might have thought there was ride. Anyway, to comply, ensure R line remains all '-'.

So the main changes are on H line, replacing all hits with '-', and confirm R is clear. Let me reconstruct each line:

K remains: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S remains: ----|O---|----|O---
H becomes: ----|----|----|----
T stays empty
C stays: O---|----|----|----
R stays empty

Double-check the user's request: no ride (R) or hihat (H). All set. That should be the edited version.
