Okay, I need to change all the snare hits to sidesticks. Let me look at the given drum groove first.

The Snare line (S:) currently has O's on the downbeats of beats 2 and 4. According to the notation rules, S: uses O for hard hits, o for soft open hits, and X/x for sidestick (hard and soft). The user wants all snare hits to be sidesticks, so I should replace those O's with X's. 

Looking at the S line: "----|O---|----|O---". The O's are on the first 16th note of beat 2 and beat 4. So replacing each O with X would make it "----|X---|----|X---". 

Wait, but I should check if there are any other snare hits. The other parts of the S line are dashes, so only those two O's need changing. The other instruments like Hihat (H:) has X's, but that's okay since they're hihat closed hits. The Kick (K:) is O's, which are unaffected. 

So the edited S line should be all dashes except for X on the second and fourth beats' first 16th notes. Let me make sure I don't miss any other S hits. The original S line only has O's in those positions. 

Therefore, the new S line becomes "----|X---|----|X---". The rest of the instruments stay the same.
