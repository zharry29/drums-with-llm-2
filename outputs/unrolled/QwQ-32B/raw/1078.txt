Okay, so I need to adjust the hihat pattern to make it more varied. Let me look at the original groove first. The current hihat (H line) is just "X---|X---|X---|X---", which means every first 16th note of each beat is a hard closed hit, and the rest are silent. That's pretty straightforward and maybe a bit monotonous.

To make it more varied, I should introduce some variation in the hits. Maybe alternate between closed and open hits, or add some softer hits. Let me recall the hihat articulations: O is a hard open, o is soft open, X and x are hard and soft closed. Since the original uses X on every first note, maybe I can mix in some x (soft closed) or even open hits here and there.

Let me think of a pattern. Maybe on the first beat, start with X, then a x on the second note, then maybe an O on the third, and leave the fourth silent. But need to spread it out over the bar. Alternatively, a common approach in jazz or funk is to have a steady closed hi-hat on the beats but add some opens or softer hits on the offbeats. 

Alternatively, maybe a pattern like X-x- for each beat, which would be hard closed on the first 16th, then soft closed on the third. That adds some dynamic variation without being too busy. Let me check if that's varied enough.

Alternatively, maybe alternate between X and x on each beat, like Xx-- for the first beat, then --Xx for the next, but need to make sure it's spread across the bar. Wait, each beat is four 16th notes. Let me structure each beat's four notes with different combinations.

First beat: X-x- (hard closed on 1, soft closed on 3)
Second beat: O--x (open on 1, soft closed on 4)
Third beat: X--- (back to original but maybe add a x on the third)
Fourth beat: X-x- again. Hmm, maybe that's too much? Let me see.

Alternatively, for variation, maybe:

Beat 1: X-x-
Beat 2: O--x
Beat 3: X-x-
Beat 4: O-x-

This way, some beats have open hits and some have softer closed hits. That should add variety. Let me check if that fits the 16th notes properly.

Wait, each beat is four characters. Let me write it out:

H: X-x- | O--x | X-x- | O-x- 

Wait, let's see each beat's four notes:

First beat: X (1), -, x (3), -
Second beat: O (1), -, -, x (4)
Third beat: same as first
Fourth beat: O (1), x (2), -, ?

Wait, in the fourth beat, "O-x-" would be O on 1, x on 2, then nothing on 3 and 4. That might create some syncopation. Alternatively, maybe O--x for the fourth beat. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe a pattern like X-x- | O-x- | X--x | O---, but need to ensure it's varied without clashing with other instruments. Since the snare is on beats 2 and 4, maybe the hihat can play around that.

Alternatively, to make it more interesting, maybe:

First beat: X-x- (closed on 1 and 3)
Second beat: O--x (open on 1, closed on 4)
Third beat: X--- (back to original, but maybe that's too simple)
Fourth beat: O-x- (open on 1, closed on 2)

Hmm, maybe that's better. Let me try writing it out as:

H: X-x-|O--x|X-x-|O-x-

Wait, but each beat must have four characters. Let me confirm each beat's four notes:

First: X - x -
Second: O - - x
Third: X - x -
Fourth: O - x -

Wait, fourth beat would be O on 1, then nothing on 2, but x on 3? Wait, "O-x-" would be O on 1, x on 2, then -, -, so that's O-x-.

Alternatively, maybe:

H: X-x- | O-x- | X--x | O-x-

This way, each beat has some variation. Let me see if that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe using some open hits and soft closed.

Alternatively, another approach: use closed on all downbeats but add some open or soft on the offbeats. For example:

Beat 1: X - o - (hard closed on 1, open on 3)
Beat 2: X - x - (hard closed on 1, soft closed on 3)
Beat 3: same as beat1
Beat 4: X - O - (hard closed on1, hard open on3)

But need to ensure that the pattern isn't too repetitive. Alternatively, mixing in different articulations across the four beats.

Alternatively, maybe:

H: X-x- | O-x- | X--x | O-x-

Wait, perhaps the key is to have different combinations in each beat so that the pattern isn't just the same every time. Let me try to come up with a pattern that cycles through different hits.

Another idea: first beat X-x-, second beat O--x, third beat X--x, fourth beat O-x-. This way, each beat has a different combination. Let me write that:

H: X-x-|O--x|X--x|O-x-

Now check each beat's four notes:

Beat1: X (1), -, x (3), -
Beat2: O (1), -, -, x (4)
Beat3: X (1), -, -, x (4)
Beat4: O (1), x (2), -, -

This gives a varied pattern with open and closed hits in different positions. The user wanted more variation, so this should work. Alternatively, maybe adding a soft open or closed somewhere else.

Alternatively, in the third beat instead of X--x, maybe X-x- again but that might repeat. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe adding an o (soft open) in some places. Let me see:

Maybe:

H: X-xo | O-x- | X--x | O-x-

But that might be overcomplicating. Let me stick to the previous idea. I think the main thing is to avoid having all X--- on every beat, so introducing different articulations and positions should suffice. Let me confirm that in the final answer.
