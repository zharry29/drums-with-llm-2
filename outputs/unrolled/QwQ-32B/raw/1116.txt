Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a cymbal hit on the 'a' of the second beat. First, I need to recall how the notation works. Each bar has 16th notes, with four per beat separated by |. The '1 e & a' refers to the subdivisions of a beat: 1 is the first 16th, 'e' is the second, '&' the third, and 'a' the fourth. So the second beat's 'a' would be the fourth 16th note of that beat.

Looking at the given groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

The user wants a cymbal hit on the 'a' of the second beat. The cymbals here are Crash (C) and Ride (R). Since the current C is hitting on the downbeats (first 16th of each beat), maybe we can use the Ride (R) for the 'a' since it's more common for ride to play off-beats. 

The second beat is "OO--" for Kick. The 'a' of the second beat is the fourth 16th note, which is the last character in the second segment before the |. So in the second beat's part for R, which is currently "----", I need to place an X or x on the fourth 16th note. Since the user might prefer a closed hit (X is hard closed on the bow for Ride), I'll put an X there. 

So the Ride line should change from "----|----|----|----" to "----|---X|----|----". That adds the hit on the 'a' of the second beat. Also, check if Crash (C) is already doing something there. The Crash is hitting the first 16th of each beat (O--- for each segment), so no conflict. 

Wait, the current C line is O--- for each beat, so the second beat's first 16th is O, but the 'a' is the fourth. So adding R's X on the second beat's fourth 16th should work. Let me confirm the positions:

Second beat's Ride line was "----", so changing to "----" but the fourth character (the 'a') becomes X, making it "---X".

Yes, that should do it without overlapping. The other lines can stay the same. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other cymbal usage. The Snare has an S in the third beat, but that's separate. The Toms have a hit in the third beat's fourth 16th. So the edit should be straightforward.
