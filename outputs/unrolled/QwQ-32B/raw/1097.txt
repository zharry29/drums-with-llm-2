Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a drum groove and wants to make it have more low frequency sounds. First, I need to understand what instruments contribute to low frequencies. Typically, the kick drum (K), toms (T), and maybe the snare (S) can add lower tones, especially with harder hits. The current groove has no kick or snare, only hihats (H) and ride cymbal (R). 

Looking at the original groove:

K: all dashes, so no kick hits. 
S: also all dashes, no snare. 
H: has some x's (closed hihat) on the 3rd and 7th 16th notes of the second and fourth beats. 
Toms (T) and crash (C) are inactive. 
Ride (R) has a pattern with x and X, which are closed hits on the bow, contributing to higher frequencies.

To add more low end, I should introduce kick and maybe toms. Since the user wants more low frequencies, starting with the kick makes sense. The kick is a primary low-frequency element. Let's add some kick hits where there's space. The existing hihats are on the 3rd and 7th 16th notes, so maybe align the kick with those or on the downbeats.

The original ride pattern is x---|X-x- repeated. The hihats are sparse. Let's place kicks on the downbeats (first 16th note of each beat) for a solid foundation. Since the user might want a consistent low end, maybe a steady kick on every beat. Let's try K: O--- repeated four times (O---|O---|O---|O---). The 'O' is a hard hit, which is good for low frequencies.

Next, check if adding toms (T) would help. Toms can add depth. Maybe on the second and fourth beats to complement the snare's absence. But since there's no snare, perhaps adding toms on the offbeats. For example, on the "&" of each beat (the 8th note), but need to see the timing. Alternatively, on the 3rd 16th note where the hihat is already hit. Let's try T: ----|---O|----|---O (so on the 3rd 16th of the second and fourth beats). Using 'O' for a hard hit there.

Wait, the original hihats have hits on the 3rd and 7th 16th notes. Maybe align the toms with those. So on beat 2, the third 16th is hihat X, so adding a tom O there. Similarly on beat 4. That would create a syncopated low end.

Also, since the user wants more low frequencies, maybe make the kick hits harder (O) and add some tom hits. Let me structure this:

K: O--- on each beat, so every first 16th note of each beat. That gives a steady kick.

Toms: On beats 2 and 4, third 16th note (aligned with hihat's X), so T: ----|---O|----|---O. That's two tom hits.

Alternatively, maybe add more tom hits. Let me see:

Original hihats: H: ----|x---|----|x---. Wait, actually in the given groove:

H is: "----|x---|----|x---" meaning on the second beat's first 16th? Wait no, let me parse the original H line again.

The user's input for H is:

H: ----|x---|----|x---

Each | separates beats. So beat 1: ----, beat2: x--- (so first 16th note of beat2 has an x), beat3: ----, beat4: x--- (first 16th of beat4). Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. The user's H line in the problem is:

H: ----|x---|----|x---

So the closed hihats are on the first 16th of beats 2 and 4. The original R is:

R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

So on beat 1: x--- (first 16th is x), beat2: X-x- (first is X, third is x), etc.

Hmm, so to add low end, placing kicks on the downbeats (first 16th of each beat) would be standard. Let's do that with O--- for K.

Then, perhaps add some toms on the & of each beat (the 8th note, which is the second 16th note) for more depth. Or on the snare's typical positions, but since there's no snare, maybe on the 3rd 16th of beats 2 and 4 where the hihats have their x.

Alternatively, maybe a tom fill on the offbeats. Let me try:

K: O---|O---|O---|O--- (constant kick on every beat)

T: ----|O---|----|O--- (tom on beat2 first 16th and beat4 first 16th? But that's where the hihat is. Alternatively, on the third 16th of each beat?)

Wait, maybe better to place toms on the third 16th of beats 1-4 to add more layers. Let's try:

T: ---O|---O|---O|---O so on the third 16th of each beat. That would be O on the third 16th, creating a syncopated tom hit. Since the kick is on the first 16th, that would create a "kick-tom" pattern every beat.

Alternatively, maybe only on beats 2 and 4 for variation. Let's see:

Putting it all together:

K: O--- repeated four times.

T: Maybe on the third 16th of each beat, so each beat has ---O. That would give T: ---O|---O|---O|---O.

This adds a tom hit on the third 16th of every beat, which is an offbeat, adding more low-end activity.

Alternatively, maybe a harder hit on the kick and toms. Since O is hard, that's good.

So the edited groove would have K with steady downbeats, and T with syncopated hits. Let's check if that's within the 16 characters.

Testing:

K: O---|O---|O---|O---
T: ---O|---O|---O|---O

Yes, each has 16 characters.

Also, maybe the snare can be added but the original has none, so perhaps keeping it as per user's instruction unless adding a snare would add low end. But since the user didn't mention adding snare, maybe stick to kick and toms.

Alternatively, maybe a crash (C) on the first beat to add some low cymbal, but crash is higher, maybe not. Or a ride bell (R's O) instead of the bow hits. But the user wants low frequencies, so probably better to focus on K and T.

So the final edit would be:

K: O--- on all four beats.

T: ---O on each beat (third 16th note).

H remains the same unless we can make it closed (X instead of x for harder hits?), but X is already used in the original H line. Wait the original H has x---, so maybe changing those to X for harder closed hits, which might add some more mid-low, but not as much as kick/toms.

Alternatively, keeping H as is, but focusing on K and T.

So the final notation would be:

K: O---|O---|O---|O---
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ---O|---O|---O|---O
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Wait but the user's original had R as active, so leaving R as is unless we need to mute it, but the request is to add low, not remove highs. So this should work.

Alternatively, maybe the toms can be on different positions. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, if the user wants more low, maybe a double kick? Like K: O-O-|O-O- etc. But that might be too much. Let's see:

Alternatively, on the first beat, K: O---, second beat O---, etc. Steady kick. The toms on the third 16th of each beat adds a syncopated low tom hit, which should help. That should fulfill the requirement.
