Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. Let me first understand what they want. The user said, "I don't want any cymbal or ride." Looking at the given drum groove, I need to remove any parts that involve the crash cymbal (C) and the ride cymbal (R). Let me check each line of the provided drum notation.

Starting with the given groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Wait, actually, looking at the C line, it's all dashes, so there's no crash cymbal being played here. But the R line (Ride cymbal) has some hits: "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-". So the user wants to eliminate the ride cymbal. Also, the user mentioned "cymbal" generally, but since crash cymbal (C) is already inactive, maybe they just want to remove the ride. 

So, the task is to set the R line to all dashes. Let me confirm the other instruments. The snare (S) has some X and -X, which are sidestick hits, which are allowed since the user only wants to remove cymbals/ride. The hihat (H) has x and -x, which are closed hits (since per the notation, X and x are closed hits for hihat). The user didn't mention hihat, so that stays. Kick (K) and Toms (T) are also unaffected. 

So the edited version should have the R line cleared. Let me rewrite each line accordingly:

K remains the same: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S remains: ----|X---|--X-|----
H remains: ----|x---|----|x---
T stays empty: ----|----|----|----
C is already empty, so stays: ----|----|----|----
R becomes all dashes: ----|----|----|----

Wait, but the original R line had some x and X. So replacing those with '-' will remove the ride. Let me double-check the user's instruction. They said "no cymbal or ride." Since the crash (C) is already not playing, only the ride (R) needs to be turned off. 

Yes, so the final edited groove should have the R line as all dashes. The other lines stay as they are unless they involve cymbals. Since S uses X and x which are sidestick (part of the snare, not cymbals), that's okay. Hihat is percussion, not a cymbal? Wait, hihat is a cymbal, but the user might have meant crash/ride specifically. Wait, the user said "no cymbal or ride." Hmm, but the hihat is technically a hi-hat cymbal. But in the notation, the H line is separate from C and R, which are the crash and ride. The user might be referring to just the crash and ride, but maybe they consider all cymbals. Let me recheck the original problem statement.

The user's request: "I don't want any cymbal or ride." Since in the given drum set, the cymbals are Crash (C) and Ride (R), and Hihat (H) is a different category. The Hihat is part of the drum set but is a closed hi-hat, which might be considered a cymbal. Wait, according to the instrument list:

H: Hihat
C: Crash cymbal
R: Ride cymbal

So the user might be referring to not wanting crash or ride, but the hihat is separate. The user's wording is a bit ambiguous. But in the problem examples before, when they said "no hihat or tom," they removed H and T. Here, the user says "no cymbal or ride," which likely refers to C and R. Since the crash (C) is already inactive, only R needs to be removed. The Hihat is a different instrument and should stay unless specified. The user didn't mention hihat, so it stays.

Therefore, the corrected groove should have R line all dashes, and the rest as original except where they involve cymbals. The snare's X and x are sidestick, not cymbals, so they stay. The Hihat's x are closed hits, which are part of the hihat, not crash/ride, so they stay.

Final check: 

Original R line: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
After editing: all '-'.

So the final answer should be the same as the input but with R line as dashes.
