Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to make the given drum groove have more low-frequency sounds. The original groove has kick drum (K) and toms (T) active, but maybe not enough in the lower range. Let me look at the provided notation first.

The current K line is: O---|O---|----|O--- which means the kick hits on the first 16th note of the first, second, and fourth beats. The toms (T) are O-o- repeated four times, so they're playing on every beat's first 16th note with a hard hit followed by a soft hit on the second 16th. 

Low frequencies typically come from the kick drum and toms. To add more low end, maybe we can increase the kick's presence. The current kick is sparse, only on beats 1, 2, and 4. Maybe adding more kick hits or making them harder. Also, the toms are already there but perhaps they can be reinforced or played harder. 

Looking at the user's request, they might want more kick and toms. Since the toms are already O-o-, which is a hard hit followed by a soft, maybe we can make those harder or add more tom hits. Alternatively, layering the kick and toms on the same hits. 

Wait, the user said "more low frequency sounds," so maybe emphasize the kick more. Let's see: the kick is only on three beats. Adding a kick on the third beat as well would make it more consistent. Also, perhaps doubling the kick hits on some notes where the toms are playing. 

Alternatively, since the toms are on every beat's first 16th, maybe the kick can also hit those, creating a combined low sound. Let's check the original T line: each beat starts with O (hard tom) then o (soft on the second 16th). If we have the kick also hit on those first 16th notes, that would reinforce the low end. 

So modifying the kick line to have O on every first 16th of each beat. The original K is O--- on beats 1,2, and 4, but not on 3. So changing the third beat's first 16th to O. Also, maybe making some of the kick hits harder (but they are already O, which is the hardest). Alternatively, adding more kick hits in between. 

Alternatively, maybe adding more kick hits on the offbeats. For example, adding an O on the third 16th of some beats. Let's see. 

Alternatively, the toms could be made harder. Since T is O-o-, changing the O to maybe a harder hit? But the notation doesn't have a harder than O. So maybe just keeping O. 

Alternatively, adding more tom hits. The current T is every first and second 16th of each beat. Maybe adding a third hit? But that might complicate. 

Alternatively, combining kick and tom on some hits. For instance, on the first 16th of each beat, both kick and tom hit. Since they are both low, this would add more low end. 

So modifying the kick line to have O on every first 16th note of each beat. The original K line's third beat was ----, so changing that to O---. So K would be O---|O---|O---|O---. But then the fourth beat's kick is already there. 

Wait, original K is:

K: O---|O---|----|O---

So changing the third beat's first 16th to O. So K becomes O---|O---|O---|O---. That would make the kick hit every beat's first 16th. 

Additionally, the toms are already playing on those same first 16ths, so combining them would make a stronger low sound. 

Alternatively, maybe adding more kick hits in between. For example, adding an O on the third 16th of some beats. Let's see the original K has O--- on first beat, so first 16th, then nothing. Maybe adding an O on the third 16th of the first beat? That would make it O-O- for the first beat. 

But the user wants more low, so perhaps making the kick more active. Let's try both approaches. 

Option 1: Make kick hit every beat's first 16th. 

K: O---|O---|O---|O---

T remains as O-o- etc. 

Alternatively, also adding more tom hits. Since T is O-o- each beat, maybe making them O-O- instead? But that would be harder on the second 16th. 

Alternatively, keeping T as is, but adding kick on every beat. 

Alternatively, adding some double kick hits. For example, in the first beat, instead of O---, do O-O- (so first and third 16th). 

But need to check the original T's pattern. Let me look again. 

Original T line: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o- 

So each beat has first 16th O (tom), second o (soft tom), then two rests. 

If the kick is also hitting on the first 16th of each beat, then together they create a strong low hit. 

So modifying the K line to have O on every first 16th. 

So the new K would be O---|O---|O---|O--- 

That's four beats, each starting with a kick. 

Alternatively, maybe adding some more hits. 

Alternatively, the user might also want the toms to be harder. But they're already using O. 

Another idea: add a crash cymbal? But crashes are higher. The user wants low, so maybe not. 

Alternatively, using the floor tom (but in the notation, T is toms, which could include floor toms, but the notation doesn't differentiate. So perhaps just making the T hits harder, but they are already O. 

Alternatively, adding more tom hits on the second 16th as well, but they are already present. 

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to make the kick hit every beat's first 16th, and also add some more kick hits on the offbeats. 

Alternatively, let's see the original K line: 

Original K has O--- on first beat (so first 16th), O--- on second, ---- on third, and O--- on fourth. 

So third beat has no kick. Adding a kick there. 

Also, maybe adding a kick on the third 16th of some beats. For example, in the first beat, making it O-O- (first and third 16th). 

So first beat: O-O- instead of O---. 

Second beat: O-O- 

Third: O-O- 

Fourth: O-O- 

That way, kick is on 1 and 3 of each beat, adding more activity. 

Combined with the toms' first 16th hits, that could add more low end. 

Alternatively, maybe that's too much. 

Alternatively, the user might want the kick to be doubled where the toms are. 

Alternatively, let's try the following:

K: O---|O---|O---|O--- (so every beat's first 16th)

T remains as before. 

That way, each beat has a combined kick and tom on the first 16th, which is a strong low hit. 

Additionally, maybe adding a kick on the third 16th of each beat. 

So K: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O- 

That way, kick hits on first and third 16th of each beat. 

Combined with T's first 16th, that would give even more low. 

Alternatively, let's see if that's within the user's request. 

The original T is already providing some low, but adding more kick would definitely increase low frequencies. 

So maybe the best approach is to make the kick more active. 

Alternatively, adding some ghost notes on the kick? But the notation doesn't have that. 

Alternatively, changing some O to O again, but that's the same. 

Alternatively, adding more kick hits where the toms are. 

Alternatively, let's try making the kick hit on every first and third 16th of each beat. 

So for each beat's K line: O-O- 

Thus, K: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O- 

That would double the kick hits, adding more low end. 

Additionally, the toms are still playing their O-o- pattern. 

This should give a much heavier low sound. 

Alternatively, maybe also adding a tom hit on the third 16th? But that might be more complex. 

Alternatively, the user's original T is already every first and second 16th. 

Hmm. Let me check the original groove again:

Original K: 

Beat 1: O--- 

Beat 2: O--- 

Beat3: ---- 

Beat4: O--- 

So third beat has no kick. Adding kick to beat3's first 16th. 

So new K would be O--- for all four beats. 

So the edited K line would be:

K: O---|O---|O---|O---

This way, kick is on every beat's first 16th, combining with the tom's first hit. 

That's a solid approach. 

Alternatively, to add even more, maybe the kick hits on all four 16ths of some beats? 

But that might be too much. 

Alternatively, making the kick hits harder? But they are already O. 

Alternatively, adding some o (soft kick) on other 16ths. 

Alternatively, combining with the tom's second hit. 

Wait, the toms have O on first, o on second. 

If the kick also hits on the second 16th, that would add more low. 

So for each beat, K: OO-- 

But that might be too busy. 

Alternatively, the user might prefer a more consistent kick pattern. 

Alternatively, keeping the kick on every first 16th and adding some on the third. 

So K: O-O- for each beat. 

That way, more kick activity. 

This would look like:

K: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O- 

Which is four beats each with kick on 1st and 3rd 16ths. 

Combined with the tom's O on first and o on second. 

This should provide a stronger low end. 

I think that's a good approach. Let me confirm:

Original Toms are O-o- on each beat, so first hit is tom, second is softer tom. 

Adding kick on 1st and 3rd 16ths would mean on the first 16th, both kick and tom hit, and on third 16th, kick alone. 

This should give a heavier feel. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants even more, like doubling the toms. 

Alternatively, the original toms are already on every first and second 16th. Maybe making those harder. But they are already O and o. 

Alternatively, adding more tom hits on the third or fourth 16ths. 

But the user's main focus is low frequencies, so kick is the main instrument. 

So I'll proceed with the kick changes. 

So the final edited groove would have K: O-O- repeated four times, and T remains as before. 

Wait, let me check the original T line. 

Original T is O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o- 

So each beat's T is first O, second o, then two rests. 

So with the K as O-O-|O-O- etc., the combined effect would be:

Beat 1: 

Kick hits 1 and 3, 

Tom hits 1 (O) and 2 (o). 

This should give a good low frequency presence. 

Yes, this should work. 

Alternatively, maybe also adding a kick on the second 16th? 

But that might be too much. 

Alternatively, keeping it as O-O- is sufficient. 

So the final answer would be adjusting the K line to O-O- each beat, and leaving T as is. 

Wait, but the user's original request was to "hear more low frequency sounds," so perhaps adding more kick hits is the way to go. 

Therefore, the edited drum groove would have the kick playing on every first and third 16th of each beat, providing a more consistent low end. 

So the final answer would be:

K: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O- 

And the rest as before except maybe the toms stay the same. 

Alternatively, the original T line might have some adjustments, but since the user didn't mention changing toms, just adding more low, kick is the focus. 

Thus, the edited groove would be:

K: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O- 

S remains ---- 

H remains ---- 

T remains O-o- etc. 

C and R same. 

So putting it all together:

K: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O-  
S: ----|----|O---|----  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, but the original S line was S: ----|----|O---|----. So third beat's first 16th has O (snare). 

Wait the user's original input was:

@@@
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

So when I edit, I need to make sure to only change the K line (adding more kick) and possibly T? 

Alternatively, maybe also adding some tom hits on the third 16th, but that's optional. 

Alternatively, keeping T as is. 

Therefore, the final answer would have K as O-O- on each beat, and T remains the same. 

So the @@@ block would be:

@@@
K: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O-  
S: ----|----|O---|----  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, but in the original K line, the fourth beat was O---. In the edited K line, the fourth beat is O-O-, so that's an extra kick on the third 16th. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the kick to stay on the downbeats but more consistent. 

Alternatively, making the kick hit every beat's first 16th, so K: O--- repeated four times. 

Then the K line would be O---|O---|O---|O--- 

Which adds a kick on the third beat's first 16th, which was originally silent. 

This would also increase low frequencies. 

So which approach is better? 

The user might prefer either. 

The first approach (adding more kick activity) is more intense. 

Alternatively, making sure kick is on every beat's first 16th. 

I think the second approach (K: O--- four times) is simpler and still adds the needed low by filling in the third beat. 

So maybe that's better. 

Thus, edited K line:

K: O---|O---|O---|O---

So the third beat now has a kick on the first 16th. 

Combined with the toms, that's a solid low. 

That might be sufficient. 

Therefore, the final answer would be:

K: O---|O---|O---|O--- 

The rest as original except for that. 

So putting it all together:

@@@
K: O---|O---|O---|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, this adds a kick on beat 3's first 16th, which wasn't there before, thus increasing low frequencies. 

Alternatively, combining both approaches: making kick hit every first and third 16th. 

But the user might prefer a balance. 

Since the original had a snare on the third beat's first 16th, but the kick was missing there. Adding kick there would combine with the snare, which might be okay. 

Alternatively, the snare is on third beat first 16th, so having kick there as well would make a powerful hit. 

Hmm. 

In any case, I think adding the kick on every beat's first 16th is a safe and effective way to add more low end. 

So the final answer would be the K line filled in for all four beats.
