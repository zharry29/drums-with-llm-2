Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user provided a drum groove and an edit request: "The groove should have not only tom but also ride." So, the current groove has some elements, but they want to add both tom and ride components. Let me parse the existing groove first.

Looking at the given drum notation:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So, the Kick (K) has some hits, Snare (S) has some variations, Hihat (H) is active with X and x, but Toms (T) and Ride (R) are completely empty. The user wants to add tom and ride. Wait, the request says "not only tom but also ride," which might mean that currently, there's only tom or only ride, but looking at the current groove, both T and R are inactive. So the user wants to add both? Or maybe they meant that it should have both tom and ride instead of just one of them? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous, but the instruction says "not only... but also," implying that currently, only one is present. But in this case, neither is present. So probably, the user wants both added. Let me proceed with that assumption.

First, I need to add tom hits to the T line and ride hits to the R line. Let me check the existing instruments. The Kick is already doing some pattern, so I don't want to conflict. The snare has some syncopation. The hihat is closed (since H uses X and x, which are closed hits). 

For the toms, since T is currently empty, I can add some hits. Maybe start with a simple pattern. Let's see the kick's pattern. The kick is O--O in the first beat, then quiet, then --O-, etc. Maybe the toms can complement that. Maybe adding a tom hit on the off-beats where the kick isn't hitting. Let's see the first beat: K's first 16th notes are O, -, -, O. So maybe on the 2nd and 3rd 16th notes, add a tom hit. Let's try putting an O there. So T's first beat could be -O-O or something. Wait, but need to fit 4 characters per beat. Let me think step by step.

Alternatively, maybe the tom can have a steady pattern. Since Toms (T) can have O (hard) or o (soft). Let's start with a simple pattern. For example, adding a tom hit on every beat's first 16th note. So each beat starts with an O. But need to check if that conflicts with kick. Let me see:

First beat (K: O--O): The first note is O (kick), so tom could hit on the second 16th note. Alternatively, maybe on the "&" of the beat. Let me try:

T: --O- for the first beat. So in the first beat, the third 16th note has a tom. That might work. Let me see the entire bar. Let's try to distribute the tom hits where the kick isn't hitting. Alternatively, maybe a syncopated tom pattern.

Alternatively, since the user's previous examples sometimes added toms on every beat, maybe adding a tom hit on each beat's first 16th note. Let me try:

T: O---|O---|O---|O--- but check if that conflicts with kick. The first beat's first note is already O on kick. So that would clash. Maybe offset it. Let's try O on the second 16th note of each beat. So T: -O--| -O--| -O--| -O--. That way, they don't clash with the kick's first note.

Alternatively, maybe alternate between O and o for variation. Let me try:

For the first beat (K: O--O), T could be -O-- so the second 16th note has a tom hit. Then the second beat (K: ----), so T could be O--- here? Wait, but the second beat's kick is all dashes, so maybe a tom hit on the first note here. Hmm, but need to decide. Alternatively, a consistent pattern across all beats.

Alternatively, look for where the snare is hitting. The snare in the second beat (after the |) has Oo-o. So maybe align tom hits with snare? Not sure. Let me think of a simple pattern. Maybe on the "&" of each beat (the second 16th note). So each beat's T line is -O--. So for each beat, T: -O--| -O--| -O--| -O--. That would make T: -O-- repeated four times, separated by |.

Wait, but let's write that out:

T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--

But let me check each beat:

First beat: K: O--O, so the second 16th note is a tom hit (O). Then third and fourth are -, so that's okay.

Second beat: K is ----, so tom hit on second 16th note (O), then rest.

Third beat: K is --O-, so the third 16th note is O (kick). The tom would hit on second 16th note (O). That's okay, no conflict.

Fourth beat: K is ----, so tom on second 16th note again.

Alternatively, maybe vary it. Maybe the tom hits on the first 16th note of each beat where kick isn't. For example, in first beat, first note is kick, so tom on second. Second beat, kick is silent, so tom on first. Third beat's first two notes are -, so tom on first. Fourth beat similarly. But that might be better. Let me try:

First beat: T: -O-- (since first is kick)
Second beat: T: O---
Third beat: T: O---
Fourth beat: T: O---

So T would be: -O--|O---|O---|O---

But that might create a more driving feel. Alternatively, to keep it consistent, maybe alternate between O and o for dynamics.

Alternatively, maybe a tom fill on the last beat? Not sure. Let me pick a simple pattern first.

Now, for the ride (R). The user wants ride added. The current R line is all dashes. The ride can have X and x (closed hits on bow) and O and o (open on bell). Since the existing hihat is using X and x (closed), maybe the ride can add some movement. Let's see the hihat is X-x- repeating each beat. So each beat starts with X, then x, then -, then -. The ride could complement that. Maybe a steady ride pattern, like X on each 16th note, but maybe alternating X and x for variation.

Alternatively, similar to previous examples, maybe X-x- as a pattern for each beat. Let me try R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-. That way, it matches the hihat's pattern but on ride. But the hihat is already doing that. Maybe the ride can do something different. Alternatively, start with X on the first 16th, then x on the second, etc. Let's see:

R: X-x- repeated each beat. So:

R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

This would add a consistent ride pattern that complements the hihat. The hihat is closed hits, and the ride would also have closed hits but maybe on the bell? Wait, no. Wait, the ride's X and x are closed hits on the bow, so that's different from the hihat's closed hits. So it's okay to have both. 

Putting it all together:

Toms (T) added as -O-- in each beat? Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the user's previous examples had toms on every beat's third note? Let me see previous interactions. For instance, in an earlier example, when adding tom, they used ---O in each beat for T. Like in one of the previous answers, the T line became ---O|---O|---O|O---. Hmm, maybe that's a pattern they like. Let me check another example.

Wait, in the user's first example where they edited to add tom, they changed T to ---O for each beat except the last, which had O---. Maybe that's a pattern to follow. Let me see:

In the first example given by the user, the original had T: ----|----|-O--|---o, and the edit added T: ---O|---O|---O|---O. So each beat's last 16th note has a tom hit. So maybe that's the standard approach here. Let me try that here.

So for the current problem, adding Toms (T) with ---O on each beat except maybe the last? Wait, the user's edit in a previous case had all four beats with ---O. So let me try that here:

T: ---O|---O|---O|---O

But let me check if that conflicts with other instruments. The kick's last 16th note in the first beat is O (since K: O--O). So the first beat's T would have a tom on the 4th 16th note, which is the same as kick's 4th note. That would mean both kick and tom hit on the same 16th note. Is that okay? It can be, but maybe better to avoid. Alternatively, shift it.

Alternatively, maybe the tom hits on the third 16th note. Like --O- for each beat. Let me see:

First beat: K is O--O, so third note is -, so tom on third would be okay. Fourth note is O (kick). So T: --O- would hit on third 16th, which is okay. Then fourth beat's kick is ----, so tom on third. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's previous edits used the last 16th of each beat for tom. Let me proceed with that, even if there's a clash, maybe it's intended for a stronger beat.

Alternatively, maybe the tom is on the 2nd and 4th 16th notes. Like -O-O. But that might be too busy with the kick.

Alternatively, let's pick the third 16th note for tom to avoid clashing with the first note's kick. So T: --O- for each beat. That would give:

T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-

But let's check each beat:

First beat (K: O--O): tom on third, kick on fourth. Okay.

Second beat (K: ----): tom on third.

Third beat (K: --O-): third note is -, so tom okay there, kick on fourth.

Fourth beat (K: ----): tom on third.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants a more consistent tom pattern. Let me go with that for T.

Now for the ride (R). Let's use X-x- on each beat. So R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-.

Putting it all together:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

Wait, but let me check the T line again. The third beat's K is --O-, so the third note is -, and tom on third is okay. The fourth beat's K is ----, so tom on third is fine.

Alternatively, maybe the tom should be on the last 16th note of each beat to match previous examples. Let me try that:

T: ---O|---O|---O|---O

But in first beat, that's fourth 16th note which is already a kick hit (O). So both T and K hit there. Maybe that's okay, but perhaps the user might prefer avoiding that. Alternatively, in the fourth beat, the K is ----, so the tom can hit on fourth. Maybe proceed with that, as it's a standard pattern.

So T: ---O for each beat. Let me write that:

T: ---O|---O|---O|---O

Then R: X-x- each beat.

Now check the crash (C) is still empty, which is okay unless the user wanted it, but the edit only mentions tom and ride. So that's acceptable.

So final notation would be:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ---O|---O|---O|---O
C: ----|----|----|----
R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

Wait, but in the fourth beat of T, the user's original K is ----, so T's ---O would hit on the fourth 16th, which is okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the last beat's T should be O--- to vary? Like in some previous examples where the last beat had a different tom placement. Not sure. But following the pattern, keeping ---O for each is consistent.

Another thing to check: The R line's pattern. The user's previous examples sometimes used X and x in a pattern. For example, in one of the earlier answers, the ride was -X-X repeated, but here using X-x- might be better to complement the hihat's X-x-.

Wait, the hihat is already doing X-x- each beat. If the ride also does X-x-, they might clash. Maybe the ride should do something different. Like X on the first and third 16th notes. Let me think: Maybe X-X- or something else.

Alternatively, alternate between X and o on the bell. But the edit just says to add ride, so maybe just a simple pattern. Let's see:

Alternatively, to avoid clashing with the hihat's X-x-, maybe the ride can be X on the first 16th and x on the third? Like X--x. But that might not fit as well.

Alternatively, maybe the ride plays on every beat's first 16th note with X. So R: X--- repeated four times. But that might be too sparse.

Alternatively, since the hihat is doing X on the first 16th, maybe the ride does X on the second 16th. So -X--. So R: -X-- repeated. That way, they're offset.

Let me think of the hihat as X-x- (first, second, then rest), and ride as -X-- (second). So combined, they'd have hits on first and second 16th notes of each beat. That could work.

Alternatively, to make the ride more active, maybe X-x- as before but that does clash with hihat's X on first and x on second. Since they're different instruments, it might be okay, but maybe the user prefers a different approach. 

Given that in previous edits, when adding ride, they used patterns like -X-X or X-X-, perhaps the best is to choose a pattern that's consistent but not overlapping too much. Let's go with X-x- as it's simple and follows the hihat's pattern but on ride. 

Thus, finalizing the T and R lines as above. Let me write that out properly in the notation.
