Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any snare or ride elements from the provided groove. Let me start by carefully looking at the original groove.

First, the given drum notation:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

So, breaking it down by each instrument:

- **Kick (K):** All dashes, so no kick hits.
- **Snare (S):** Also all dashes, so no snare here either. Wait, the user is asking to remove snare, but it's already not present. Hmm, maybe the request is redundant, but I should still check.
- **Hihat (H):** Has x on the second and fourth beats (like x---|x---). The x here, according to the notation, is a hard closed hit since H uses X/x for closed. So closed hi-hat on those 16th notes.
- **Toms (T):** All dashes, no toms.
- **Crash (C):** Dashes, no crash.
- **Ride (R):** Has x, X, and x again. The R line uses x for closed hits on the bow. So the ride is active here with some variation (x, X, x, X).

The user's request is to remove snare and ride. Since the snare (S) is already empty, I just need to clear the ride (R) line. The hihat remains as it is because it's allowed. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. 

Wait, the user might also want to check if there's any other cymbals like crash, but in this case, crash (C) is already silent. So the main change is setting the R line to all dashes. Let me confirm each part again.

Original R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-  
After removing ride: all dashes. 

So the edited groove should look like:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, that should do it. No snare (already gone), no ride. The hihat remains with its closed hits. I think that's all. Let me double-check the user's instruction once more. Yep, "no snare or ride," which is satisfied here. The kick is also silent, but the user didn't ask to remove it, so that's fine.
