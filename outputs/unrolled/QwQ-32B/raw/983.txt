Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to "fill up the whole bar with double kick." Hmm, double kick usually means rapid hits on the bass drum, typically eighth notes or sixteenth notes. Since the original groove has a kick pattern of "O--O|----|--O-|----", I need to convert that into continuous hits.

First, I should check the existing kick pattern. The original K line is: K: O--O|----|--O-|----. That's four beats, each with four 16th notes. The first beat has an O on the first 16th and another on the fourth. The third beat has an O on the third 16th. The rest are silent. To fill the whole bar with double kick, I need to make the kick hit on every 16th note, maybe using alternating hard and soft hits (O and o) for the double kick effect.

But wait, "double kick" in drumming often refers to using both bass drum pedals to play rapid alternating hits. In notation, that's usually represented by alternating O and o or similar. However, in this notation system, each character is a single hit. Since each beat is four 16th notes, a full bar would have 16 hits. To make it a constant double kick, perhaps using alternating O and o for each 16th note. Let me see:

Each beat has four 16th notes. So for a full bar of double kick, every 16th note would have a kick hit. Let's make them alternate between O and o to mimic the double bass technique. So each beat would be OoOo|OoOo|OoOo|OoOo. That way, it's continuous and alternating. Let me check if that fits the user's request. 

Looking back at the original groove, the other instruments like Snare, Hihat, etc., are still needed. The user didn't mention changing them, so they should stay as is. Let me reconstruct the K line with this pattern and leave others untouched. 

Wait, the original Hihat has X-x- patterns, so keeping those. The Snare has some Oo-o and -o-- which might need to stay unless specified. The user's instruction is only about the kick, so I'll focus on that. 

Putting it all together, the new K line would be OoOo|OoOo|OoOo|OoOo. Let me confirm the count: each beat has four 16ths, so four characters per beat. Four beats make 16 characters. That fills the whole bar with double kick. 

I should also ensure that the other lines remain unchanged unless conflicting. The user didn't mention other changes, so proceed. Let me write the final notation accordingly.
