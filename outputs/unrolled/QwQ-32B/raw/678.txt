Alright, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a cymbal hit and a tom in the very beginning. First, I need to recall the drum notation rules to make sure I get the symbols right.

Looking at the given groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

The first beat is "O--O" for the kick, and the snare starts in the second beat. The toms and crash cymbal (C) are currently silent. The ride (R) has some hits but no crash.

The user wants a cymbal hit (probably crash) and a tom hit at the very beginning. The "very beginning" would be the first 16th note of the bar, which is the first character in the first beat (before the first |).

For the crash cymbal (line C), the first character should be 'O' for a hard hit. Since it's the first note, I'll set C's first character to 'O' and the rest as '-' unless needed. 

For the tom (line T), the first note should have a hit. The tom uses 'O' for hard, so 'O---' for the first beat. 

I need to check if adding these affects other parts. The original T and C lines are empty, so adding just the first hit should be okay. Let me make sure the rest of the characters remain as per the original except the first note.

So, modifying the C and T lines:

Original C: ----|....
New C: O---|....

Original T: ----|....
New T: O---|....

Wait, but the user specified both a cymbal (crash) and tom. So first note of the bar (first 16th note) should have both. Let me confirm:

Yes, the first 16th note (position 1) gets an 'O' on crash (C) and 'O' on tom (T). The rest of the first beat for C and T can stay as '-' unless the user wants more, but the request is only for the very beginning. 

So the edited lines would be:

C: O---|----|----|----
T: O---|----|----|----

I need to ensure that the other lines remain the same. Let me double-check the kick and snare to not interfere. The kick's first beat is "O--O", which is okay. The snare starts later. 

Final check: The first note now has a crash (C: O) and tom (T: O), meeting the request. That should be it.
