Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any ride or kick elements from the given groove. Let me first look at the provided drum notation to understand what's there.

Starting with the Kick (K line): "O---|---o|O-O-|----". So there are hits on the first 16th note of the first beat, the fourth 16th note of the second beat, and a pattern on the third beat. Since the request is to remove kick, I need to replace all K's non '-' characters with '-'.

Next, the Ride (R line): It's all dashes, so no ride is already present. But just to be safe, check if any other cymbals like Crash (C) are there. The Crash line has "O---|----|----|----", so there's a crash on the first beat. But the user only mentioned ride and kick, so maybe leave crash unless specified. Wait, the user said "I don't want any ride or kick." So only remove ride and kick. The crash is separate, so it stays unless instructed otherwise. But let me confirm the edit request again: "I don't want any ride or kick." So only remove those two.

Looking at the Snares (S), Hihats (H), and Toms (T) are okay as they are. The user didn't mention them. So the edits are straightforward:

For K line: replace all non '-' with '-', so K becomes "----|----|----|----".

R line is already all dashes, so no change needed.

Check the Crash (C) line: since the user didn't mention crashes, leave as is. But let me check the original problem statement again to ensure. The user's instruction is to remove ride and kick. So Crash remains. 

Wait, in some previous examples, when users said "no cymbal", that included crash and ride. Here, since it's "no ride or kick", only those two are removed. So the final edited groove should have K and R lines cleared, others remain.

Putting it all together:

Original lines:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

After editing:

K becomes all dashes.

R remains all dashes.

So the final should be:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I need to ensure that each line is correctly formatted with 16 characters (4 beats of 4 notes each). Let me check each line's length:

K: 16 dashes: yes.

S: Each segment is 4 chars, 4 segments: 16.

H: Same structure.

T: Same.

C: First beat has 'O---' then three '----', so total 16.

R: All dashes.

Looks correct. So that's the edited groove.
