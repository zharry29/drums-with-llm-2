Okay, so the user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing any snare or cymbal parts. Let me look at the given drum groove first.

The original groove has Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R) lines. The user's request is to eliminate snare and cymbals. That means I need to set the S (Snare) and both C (Crash) and R (Ride) lines to all '-' characters, since those are the cymbals. 

Looking at the provided drum notation:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

First, I'll check the S line. It has some hits in the second, third, and fourth beats. To remove the snare, I need to replace all non '-' characters in the S line with '-'. The C and R lines are already all '-', so maybe they're okay, but I should double-check. The user mentioned "cymbal," which includes Crash (C) and Ride (R). Since both are already empty, no changes there.

Wait, the Hihat (H) is a closed/closed hits because of the X and x. The user didn't mention removing hihat, so that stays. The Toms (T) are silent here, so they remain as is.

So the edited version should have S, C, R lines all set to "----|----|----|----". Let me reconstruct each line:

K remains the same: O--O|----|--O-|----
S becomes all '-'
H stays as X-x- etc.
T stays the same
C and R stay as all '-'

Wait, but the user's instruction says "I don't want any snare or cymbal." Since cymbals include Crash and Ride, but in the original, those are already inactive. So only the snare line needs to be cleared. Let me confirm:

Original S line: has Oo-o, -o--, O--o. So setting all to '-'.

So the final edited groove should look like:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, that should do it. I just need to make sure that in the S line, every character except '|' is replaced with '-', and confirm C and R are empty. Looks good.
