Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the kick and ride cymbal parts. 

First, I'll look at the original groove provided. The Kick (K) line is "o---|--o-|o---|--o-". Since the user doesn't want any kick, I'll replace all the characters in the K line with dashes to silence it. That part is straightforward.

Next, the Ride (R) line is "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-". The request is to remove ride, so I'll set all those to dashes as well. 

Now, checking the other instruments to make sure they're okay. The Snare (S) has some X and x hits, but since the user didn't mention snare, those stay. The Hihat (H) has x's, which are allowed unless specified. Toms and Crash are already silent, so no changes there.

Wait, let me double-check the user's exact request: "I don't want any kick or ride." Yep, so just those two lines need to be cleared. 

So the edited version should have K and R lines all dashes, while others remain as they are. Let me put that together.
