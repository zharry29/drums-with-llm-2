Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any hihat or ride parts from the given drum groove. First, I need to recall the structure of the drum notation provided. Each line corresponds to a different drum component: K for kick, S for snare, H for hihat, T for toms, C for crash cymbal, and R for ride cymbal. Each character in the lines represents a 16th note, with '-' indicating no hit, and other characters like O, o, X, x denoting different hits or articulations.

Looking at the given groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

The user's request is to eliminate the hihat (H line) and ride (R line). So, first step is to set all characters in the H and R lines to '-'.

Let me check each line:

- The Kick (K) line has some hits, but since the user didn't mention removing kick, leave it as is.
- Snare (S) has a 'S---' in the third beat. Since they want no hihat or ride, but the snare is separate, so leave S line.
- Hihat (H) has 'x-x-' repeated. These need to be replaced with '----'.
- Toms (T) have a '---O' in the third beat. Since the user didn't mention toms, leave unless specified. The request is only about hihat and ride, so T remains.
- Crash (C) is all O's. The user didn't mention crashes, so they stay unless specified. The request doesn't target crashes, so leave C as is.
- Ride (R) is all '-', so it's already silent, but to comply strictly, set all to '-' just in case.

Wait, the user might not want any cymbals? Wait the edit request says "no hihat or ride". Crash is a different cymbal. Since the user didn't mention crashes, we don't touch them. So only H and R lines are cleared.

So the edited version should have H and R lines all '-'.

Let me reconstruct each line:

K remains:
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-

S remains:
S: ----|----|S---|----

H becomes:
H: ----|----|----|----

T remains:
T: ----|----|---O|----

C remains:
C: O---|O---|O---|O---

R becomes:
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, the original R line was already all '-', so that's okay. Just ensuring H is cleared.

Let me double-check the user's request again: "I don't want any hihat or ride." So yes, that's exactly what's done here. The crash cymbal (C) is allowed unless specified, so it stays. The tom (T) also stays unless the user wanted that removed, but the request didn't mention it.

Therefore, the final edited groove should look like this with H and R lines all dashes.
