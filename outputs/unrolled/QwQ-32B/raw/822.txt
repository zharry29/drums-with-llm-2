Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a ride hit and hihat in the very beginning. 

First, I'll look at the original groove provided:

**Original Groove:**
```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

The user's request is to add a ride hit and hihat at the start. The "very beginning" refers to the first 16th note of the bar. Let's break down each instrument's first beat.

**Kick (K):** Starts with "O--O" in the first beat. The first note is a hard kick (O).

**Snare (S):** First beat has "----", so nothing on the first 16th note.

**Hihat (H):** The first beat is "X-x-", meaning the first note is a hard closed hit (X). But the user wants a hihat in the beginning, so maybe they want an open hit or just confirming it's there? Wait, the request says "ride hit and hihat", so perhaps they want both. The hihat is already present with an X (closed hit) on the first note. Maybe they want an open hit instead? Or maybe they want to add a hihat if it wasn't there. Wait, the hihat is already there, so maybe the main thing is adding the ride.

**Ride (R):** Currently all dashes, so no ride hits. The user wants a ride hit at the beginning. The first note of the first beat should have an O (hard hit on the bell) for the ride.

So, to fulfill the request:

1. **Ride (R):** Add an 'O' at the very first 16th note (first character of the first beat). The rest can stay as dashes unless the user wants a pattern. Since it's just the beginning, only the first note needs the ride hit.

2. **Hihat (H):** The first note is already an X (closed hit). If the user wants an open hit, we can change it to O. But the original uses X, so maybe they want to keep it as is. The request says "hihat in the very beginning" which is already present. So perhaps just the ride is needed.

Therefore, the main change is adding 'O' to the ride's first note. Let me confirm:

Original Ride line: `R: ----|----|----|----`

Change first character to O: `R: O---|----|----|----`

The hihat remains as `H: X-x-|...` since it's already there. 

Wait, but maybe the user wants the hihat to start with an open hit? The original has X (closed). Let me check the notation again. The user might want an open hihat (O) instead of closed (X). Since the instruction says "hihat in the very beginning", maybe they just want to ensure it's present, which it is. But if they prefer open, changing X to O. However, without explicit instructions, safer to keep as X unless specified. 

So final edit would be adding the ride hit at the first note and keeping hihat as is. Let's put it together.
