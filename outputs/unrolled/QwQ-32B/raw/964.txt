Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the hihat on beat 4 while keeping everything else the same. First, I need to understand the structure of the given drum notation. 

Looking at the provided example, each line represents a different drum component. The H line is for the hihat. The groove given is:

@@@
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

The user's request is to eliminate the hihat on beat 4. The hihat's current pattern is "----|x---|----|x---". Breaking this down, each beat is separated by |, so the fourth beat is the last segment "|x---". The 'x' here indicates a closed hit on the hihat. To remove it, I need to replace the 'x' in the fourth beat with '-'.

So, the fourth beat's hihat part should change from "x---" to "----". Let me check each part again to ensure I'm not altering other beats. The first three beats of the hihat are already silent except for the second beat having an 'x' on the first 16th note. The fourth beat's 'x' is at the start of the fourth beat. Changing that to '-' will remove the hit there.

Now, I'll reconstruct the H line accordingly. The original H line is:

H: ----|x---|----|x---

After modification, it should be:

H: ----|x---|----|----

Wait, no. Wait, the fourth segment is "|x---", so the fourth beat's first note is 'x'. To remove that, change the first character of the fourth segment to '-'. So the fourth segment becomes "- ---" (but keeping the other three characters as '-', so "----"). 

Therefore, the corrected H line becomes:

H: ----|x---|----|----

Wait, let me verify. The original H line is split into four beats:

Beat 1: ----

Beat 2: x---

Beat 3: ----

Beat 4: x---

So the fourth beat's hihat has an 'x' on the first 16th note. To remove that, set the first character of the fourth beat to '-', making it "----".

So the new H line would be:

H: ----|x---|----|----

Yes. Now, check the other lines to ensure they remain unchanged. The K, S, T, C, and R lines should stay exactly as they are. The R line has a pattern that includes X-x- on the second and fourth beats, but since the user only mentioned the hihat, those should stay.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should look like this:

@@@
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Wait, but in the original R line, the fourth beat is "|X-x-", so the X is on the first 16th note. The user didn't mention ride, so that's okay. The only change is the hihat on beat 4. Let me double-check the H line again. The fourth beat's hihat was "x---", so changing the first 'x' to '-' makes it "- ---", but the rest are already '-', so it becomes "----". 

Yes, that's correct. So the final edited groove should have the H line's fourth beat as "----".
