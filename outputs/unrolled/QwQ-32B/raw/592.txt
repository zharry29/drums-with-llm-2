Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a specific drum notation and wants me to remove the snare and ride parts. Let me start by understanding the original groove.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user's request is to eliminate any snare (S) or ride (R). So first, I need to check where the snare is playing. The S line has hits in the second and fourth beats. The R line is already empty, so no action there. 

My steps:
1. Set all S line characters to '-' to remove snare.
2. Ensure R remains empty as it's already clear.
3. Keep other instruments (K, H, T, C) as they are unless they conflict, but the user didn't mention them.

Wait, the crash (C) is present. The user didn't mention crashes, so leave them. The hihat (H) has some patterns; since the request is only about snare and ride, those stay. The kick (K) and toms (T) are okay too.

Let me reconstruct each line:

- K remains unchanged: O---|---o|O-O-|----
- S becomes all '-': ----|----|----|----
- H stays: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- T remains empty: ----|----|----|----
- C stays: O---|----|----|----
- R is already empty.

I need to double-check that I didn't miss any S or R hits. The original S had O's in the second and fourth beats, so replacing those with '-' is correct. The R line was already clear, so nothing to do there. The rest are as per original. That should fulfill the user's request.
