Okay, let's tackle this edit request. The user wants to remove any cymbal or hihat parts from the given drum groove. First, I need to recall which lines correspond to those instruments. From the notation key:

- **C** is the Crash cymbal
- **R** is the Ride cymbal
- **H** is the Hihat

So, I need to set all the characters in the C, R, and H lines to '-' (no hit). Let me check the original drum groove provided:

Original Groove:
```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Looking at each line:

- **K** (Kick) is okay, no changes needed.
- **S** (Snare) is allowed since the user only removed cymbals and hihat.
- **H** (Hihat) has hits like X--- in each beat. These need to be replaced with '----'.
- **T** (Toms) are already silent, so no change.
- **C** (Crash) is already silent, so no change.
- **R** (Ride) is also silent, so no change.

Wait, but the user said "I don't want any cymbal or hihat." Since both C and R are cymbals, even if they're silent, maybe I should confirm they stay silent. The H line needs to be all '-'.

So modifying the H line to all '-', and ensuring C and R remain as they are (since they're already empty). Let me double-check:

After editing:
```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Yes, that should do it. The Kick and Snare remain, while Hihat, Crash, and Ride are all silent. The user didn't mention Kick or Snare, so those stay as they were.
