Alright, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants ghost notes added to the snare. First, I need to recall what ghost notes are. They're usually soft, muted hits on the snare, often played between the main beats to add texture and dynamics. 

Looking at the given groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The snare (S) currently has hits on the second beat of the second and fourth measures. To add ghost notes, I should place soft hits (using 'o' since that's the soft open hit for the snare) on the offbeats where there's space. 

Let me break it down measure by measure.

First measure (K: O---):
- Kick hits on the first three 16th notes.
- Snare is silent here. Maybe add ghost notes on the offbeats. The hihat has some activity (--o-), so maybe syncopate with that. Since the hihat is open on the third 16th note, perhaps a ghost note there? But the hihat is already playing. Alternatively, between the kick hits. The kick is O-O-O-, so maybe on the 'and' of the beats. Let's see: the first measure has four 16th notes. The kick is on 1, 2, 3. So the fourth 16th note is empty. Maybe a ghost note there? Or maybe split the measure into eighths. Hmm. Alternatively, add two ghost notes between the kicks. Let's see, first measure's snare line is "----", so all four 16ths are empty. To add ghost notes, perhaps on the "e" and "a" of the first and second beats? Like o-o- or something. But need to check the existing hihat to not clash. The hihat here is "--o-", so the third 16th note is an open hit. Maybe place a ghost on the fourth? So first measure snare becomes o-o- or o--o?

Wait, maybe better to look at each measure:

Measure 1:
K: O--- (hits on 1, 2, 3 of 16ths)
S: ----
H: --o- (open hit on third 16th)
So maybe add ghost notes on the first and fourth 16ths? Or second and fourth? Let's try o-o- (first and third 16th as ghosts). But need to see if that works with the hihat.

Measure 2:
K: ---o (hit on fourth 16th)
S: O--- (hit on first beat, which is the fourth 16th of the measure)
H: O-o- (open on first, then closed on second and third 16ths)
Hmm, so the snare is hitting on the downbeat (fourth 16th). To add ghost notes before that, maybe on the first and second 16ths? So like o-o- before the O. But the hihat here has an open hit on the first 16th. Maybe a ghost on the second and third? Like -o-o? Or o--o? Wait, the hihat's first 16th is open, so a ghost on the second could work. Let's see: S: o-o- would have ghosts on 1 and 3, but the hihat is open on 1. Alternatively, maybe -o-o-? That would leave the first 16th empty, ghost on second and third? Not sure. Maybe better to place the ghost on the third 16th since the hihat is closed there. Hmm.

Measure 3:
K: O-O- (hits on first and third 16ths)
S: ----
H: O-o- (open first, closed second and third)
So here, the snare is silent. Maybe add ghosts on the second and fourth 16ths? Like -o-o?

Measure 4:
K: ----
S: O---
H: O-o- (open first, closed second and third)
So snare hits on the fourth 16th (the downbeat of the next measure, but in the fourth measure's context). To add ghost notes before that, maybe on the first and third 16ths. So something like o-o- before the O? But the hihat is open on the first, so maybe -o-o-?

Alternatively, maybe use 'x' for sidestick? Wait, the user said ghost notes on the snare, so probably 'o' since that's the soft open hit. The X and x are sidestick, which might be different. So stick to 'o's.

Putting this together, perhaps:

Measure 1: o-o-
Measure 2: o-o- (before the O)
Measure 3: -o-o
Measure 4: -o-o before the O

But need to ensure that the original snare hits stay in place. Let me try writing it out step by step.

Original S line:
S: ----|O---|----|O---

After adding ghost notes:

First measure (---- becomes o-o-): so "o-o-|"

Second measure (O--- becomes maybe o-O- or o-oO? Wait, the original hit is on the fourth 16th. So the second measure's S line is O--- which is a hard hit on the fourth. To add ghosts before that, maybe on the first and third 16ths. So "o-O-"? But the first 16th is an 'o', the second '-', third 'O'? Wait, no, the O is the fourth. Wait, the second measure's S line is four 16ths. The original is O---, so the first 16th is O, but that's conflicting with the kick's placement? Wait no, the kick in the second measure is ---o (hit on fourth), so the snare's O on first 16th would be okay. Wait, but the user wants to add ghost notes, so maybe instead of O---, we can have o-O- or something? Hmm, maybe better to have the main hit on the fourth, so the original is O--- meaning the first 16th is hit. Wait, perhaps the original S line in the second measure is O---, meaning the first 16th is a hard hit. But the user wants to add ghost notes, so perhaps redistribute. Maybe the main hit stays, but add softer hits around.

Wait, perhaps the user's original S line in the second measure is O---, so the first 16th is a hard hit. To add ghost notes, maybe make it o-O- (soft on first, hard on first? No, conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the main hit is on the fourth 16th, so the original is O--- meaning first 16th. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Looking at the given groove:

S: ----|O---|----|O---

Each measure is four 16ths. The second measure's S is O---, so first 16th is a hard hit (O). The fourth measure's S is O---, so again first 16th. But the user wants ghost notes added. Maybe the main hits are on the downbeats, but they want some softer hits in between.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the original snare hits to stay, and add additional ghost notes. For example, in the second measure where the snare hits on the first 16th, maybe add a ghost on the third? So O-o- ?

But the user's instruction is to "add some ghost notes on the Snare", so perhaps the original hits remain, and new soft hits are added where possible.

Let me try again. Let's go measure by measure.

Measure 1: K: O--- (hits 1,2,3), S: ----. Add ghost notes on the offbeats. Maybe on 4th 16th? So o--- becomes no, but maybe o on 1, then 3? Wait, the kicks are on 1-3, so maybe between them. Let's see:

Measure 1: S: o-o- (ghost on 1 and 3, leaving 2 and 4 empty). But hihat is --o- (hit on 3). So the ghost on 3 would clash with hihat's open hit. Maybe better on 2 and 4? So -o-o. That might work.

Measure 2: K: ---o (hit on 4), S: O--- (hit on 1). To add ghost notes, maybe on 2 and 3. So O becomes O with o's on 2 and 3: O-oo? But that would be O on 1, then o on 2 and 3. So the line would be O-oo.

Measure 3: K: O-O- (hits on 1 and 3), S: ----. Add ghosts on 2 and 4: -o-o.

Measure 4: K: ----, S: O--- (hit on 1). Add ghosts on 2 and 4: O-oo.

Wait, but the user wants the original snare hits to stay. Let me check again:

Original S line is:

Measure1: ----

Measure2: O---

Measure3: ----

Measure4: O---

So the main hits are on the first 16th of measures 2 and 4. To add ghost notes, we can add 'o's in other positions without conflicting.

So for measure1: add o on 2 and 4? So "-o-o"

Measure2: keep the O on first, add o on 2 and 3 or 4? Let's say "-o-o" after the O: O--- becomes O-oo?

Measure3: add o on 2 and 4: "-o-o"

Measure4: similar to measure2: O--- becomes O-oo?

Alternatively, maybe vary it. Let's try:

Measure1: S: -o-o

Measure2: S: O-o- (ghost on second)

Measure3: S: -o-o

Measure4: S: O-o-

This way, the main hits stay, and there are ghost notes added. Let's see:

Putting it all together:

S: -o-o | O-o- | -o-o | O-o-

But let's check if that makes sense. The user might prefer more consistent ghost notes. Alternatively, maybe add two per measure where possible.

Alternatively, in measure2, after the O on first, add o on 3rd and 4th? So O--o.

But the user might prefer a consistent pattern. Alternatively, using every other 16th note.

Alternatively, the standard ghost note pattern is often on the "and" of each beat, so eighth note triplets? Hmm, but in 16ths, maybe on the 2nd and 6th 16ths in the bar? Not sure. Maybe better to go with simple offbeats.

Alternatively, in each measure where the snare is silent, add two ghost notes. For measures 1 and 3, which have no snare hits, add o's on two positions. For measures 2 and 4, add an o somewhere besides the main hit.

So finalizing:

Measure1: S: o-o- (ghosts on 1 and 3, but considering hihat's open on 3, maybe -o-o instead)

Measure2: S: O-o- (main hit on 1, ghost on 3)

Measure3: S: -o-o (ghosts on 2 and 4)

Measure4: S: O-o- (main hit on 1, ghost on 3)

This way, it's consistent and avoids clashing with hihats where possible. Let me write that out:

S: -o-o | O-o- | -o-o | O-o-

Wait, but the first measure's hihat has an open on third, so the ghost on third might clash. So maybe first measure: -o-o (ghost on second and fourth). Hihat's third is open, so that's okay. The hihat is --o- in measure1, so third is open. So the ghost on fourth is okay.

Alternatively, maybe:

Measure1: -o-o (ghost on 2 and 4)

Measure2: O-o- (ghost on 3)

Measure3: -o-o

Measure4: O-o-

This seems okay. Let me check the notation:

Original S line was:

S: ----|O---|----|O---

After edit:

S: -o-o|O-o-|-o-o|O-o-

So the final S line would be:

S: -o-o | O-o- | -o-o | O-o-

But let's check if the user wants more dynamic. Maybe use a mix of o and x? Wait, no, the user said ghost notes on the snare, so using 'o' (soft open) is correct. The X is for sidestick, which is a different technique.

Alternatively, maybe add more ghosts. Let me see another approach. In measure1, since there's no snare, maybe add three ghosts? But that might be too much. Let's stick to two per measure where possible.

Another possibility is to use a pattern like o-o- in measure1, but adjust for hihats. Alternatively, I'll proceed with the above and see.

So the final edited groove would have the S line as:

S: -o-o|O-o-|-o-o|O-o-

But let me check the alignment again. Each measure is four 16ths separated by |.

So the full S line would be:

S: -o-o | O-o- | -o-o | O-o-

Yes. That adds ghost notes while keeping the original hits in measures 2 and 4. This should fulfill the request.
