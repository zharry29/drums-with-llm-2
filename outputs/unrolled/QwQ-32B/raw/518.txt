Okay, let's see what the user is asking for here. They want me to edit a drum groove by removing any parts involving toms or cymbals. The original groove is provided in that drum notation they explained earlier. Let me first parse the given drum groove to understand which lines correspond to which instruments.

Looking at the given groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

So, the instruments here are:

- **Kick (K):** The first line has some hits.
- **Snare (S):** The third beat has an S, which I think is a soft open hit. Wait, according to the notation, S line uses O for hard, o for soft open, X/x for sidestick. The S line here has "S---" in the third beat. Wait, hold on. Wait, in the problem statement, the user mentioned that S uses O, o, X, x. So maybe "S" here is a typo? Wait, looking back at the user's problem statement:

In the S line's description: "S: O is a hard hit, while o is a soft open hit on the head; additionally, X and x are hard and soft sidestick hits". So the S line can have O, o, X, or x. But in the given groove, the S line has "S---" which might be a mistake. Wait, maybe it's a typo and should be 'o' or 'X'? Hmm, perhaps it's an 'o' but written as S? Or maybe the user made an error in input. Alternatively, maybe 'S' here is intended as a soft hit. Wait, perhaps I should check the original problem's example. Let me look at the example given in the problem's first part:

In their example drum notation, the S line was:

S: ----|X--o|----|O---

So that uses X and o, which aligns with the description. So in the given groove, the S line has "S---" in the third beat. That might be an error because 'S' isn't a valid character for the S line. The valid characters are O, o, X, x, or -. Therefore, "S" might be a typo. Since the user's edit request is to remove toms and cymbals, maybe I can assume that the 'S' in the S line is a mistake and perhaps should be 'o' (soft open hit). Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be an 'o', and the user just mistyped it as 'S'. Since the user's instruction is to remove toms and cymbals, but the S line is allowed as long as it's within its valid characters. But perhaps I should proceed as given, but note that.

Anyway, proceeding with the edit. The user wants no toms (T line) or cymbals (C and R lines). So I need to set the T, C, and R lines to all '-'.

Looking at the original:

- **Toms (T):** The line has "----|----|---O|----". The third beat has an O. That's a tom hit, so we need to remove that, making it all '-'.

- **Crash (C):** The line has "O---|O---|O---|O---", so all those Os are crash hits. Set those to '-'.

- **Ride (R):** The line is already all '-' except maybe the last part? Wait, in the given, R's line is "----|----|----|----", so already clear. So no changes there.

Additionally, check if any other lines have cymbal-related hits, but since the user is removing toms and cymbals, focus on T, C, R.

The Kick (K) and Snare (S) and Hihat (H) are okay as long as they don't involve cymbals or toms. The Hihat is allowed unless specified otherwise, but the user didn't mention removing hihat. Wait, the edit request says "I don't want any tom or cymbal." So hihat is separate, so it stays.

So, modifying the lines:

- T line: all '-'.

- C line: all '-'.

- R line remains '-'.

Now, check the S line again. The third beat has "S---", which might be an error, but since the user didn't mention it, perhaps it's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe it should be 'o'? But since the instruction is just to remove T, C, R, I'll leave S as is unless it's invalid. Since the problem allows S to have O, o, X, x, but "S" isn't valid, perhaps it's a typo. But since the user provided it that way, maybe it's a mistake but I should proceed as given, assuming it's a typo but not my place to correct. Alternatively, maybe they meant 'o'? Hmm, but since the user's instruction is to edit for removing instruments, perhaps I should leave the S line as is unless it's using invalid characters. But perhaps the 'S' is a mistake and should be ignored. Alternatively, maybe the user intended 'o' there. Since I can't be sure, maybe best to leave it as is, but the user's edit request doesn't mention fixing that. So proceed.

Thus, the edited groove would be:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, but in the T line, the original had a 'O' in the third beat. So setting that to '-'.

Yes, so the final lines are:

T: all '-'.

C: all '-'.

R: already '-'.

So that should be the result.
