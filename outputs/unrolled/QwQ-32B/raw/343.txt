Okay, let's tackle this edit request. The user wants to remove any snare or cymbal from the given drum groove. First, I need to recall the instruments and their corresponding lines. The provided groove has:

- **Kick (K):** O---|O---|----|O---
- **Snare (S):** ----|----|O---|----
- **Hihat (H):** ----|----|----|----
- **Toms (T):** O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- **Crash (C):** ----|----|----|----
- **Ride (R):** ----|----|----|----

The user specified removing snare (S) and cymbals. Looking at the instruments, cymbals include Crash (C) and Ride (R). So I need to set both S and C/R lines to all '-'.

Current S line has an O--- on the third beat, so that needs to be cleared. The C and R lines are already empty, but just to confirm, I'll set them to all '-' to be safe. The rest (K, H, T) can stay as they are since they're not snare or cymbals.

Wait, the Toms (T) are allowed since the request was about snare and cymbals. So the edited version should have S, C, R lines all dashes. Let me double-check each line:

- **K:** Remains the same.
- **S:** Change the third beat's O--- to ----.
- **H:** Already all dashes.
- **T:** Remains as toms are not cymbals.
- **C:** Already empty, set to all '-'.
- **R:** Also set to all '-'.

Putting it all together, the final groove should have S, C, R lines blank. Let me format that properly.
