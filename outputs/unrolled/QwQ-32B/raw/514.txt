Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any tom or cymbal parts. First, I need to look at each line of the given groove to identify which instruments are being used.

Starting with the Kick (K): "O--O|----|--O-|----". That's just kick hits, so no changes needed here.

Snare (S): "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o". The snare has some soft and open hits, but no tom or cymbal involvement, so this stays.

Hihat (H): "X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-". The hihat is using X and x, which according to the notation are closed hits. Since the user didn't mention removing hihat, and the request was about tom and cymbals, this should stay as is.

Toms (T): All dashes, so no tom hits here. Good, nothing to remove here.

Crash (C): All dashes, so no crash hits either. Also good.

Ride (R): All dashes, so no ride either. 

Wait, the user said "no tom or cymbal". Cymbals include crash and ride. Since both C and R lines are already empty, that's already covered. The Toms line is also empty, so nothing to remove there either. 

Wait, the original groove provided might have had some cymbals or toms that I missed? Let me check again.

Original groove lines:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Looking at all lines, T, C, R are all empty. So the user's request doesn't require any changes here. The existing groove already has no toms or cymbals. Therefore, the edited version remains the same. 

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me confirm the user's request again: "I don't want any tom or cymbal." Since the original already lacks those, the answer should just replicate the original. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to remove hihat as well, but the request specifically mentions tom and cymbal. So I'll proceed as per the given instructions.
