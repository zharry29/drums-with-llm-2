Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any ride cymbal and kick drum parts. First, I need to look at the given groove and identify which lines correspond to the Kick (K) and Ride (R) instruments. 

Looking at the provided drum notation:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The Kick (K) line has some hits, and the Ride (R) line is currently all dashes, so maybe there's nothing there. Wait, the user said "no ride or kick," so even if R is empty, I should ensure it stays empty. The main changes needed are to set K and R lines to all dashes.

So, replacing all characters in K's line with '-' to remove the kick. The Ride (R) line is already empty, so no change there. The other instruments (Snare S, Hihat H, Toms T, Crash C) can stay as they are unless they involve ride or kick, but according to the problem, only K and R need to be removed. Let me double-check each line:

- K: All hits become '-'
- S remains unchanged
- H remains unchanged
- T remains unchanged
- C remains unchanged
- R stays as all '-'

Wait, the original R line is already all dashes, so no action needed there. The main work is on K. Let me reconstruct the final groove accordingly.
