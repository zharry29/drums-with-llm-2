Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a snare hit and a tom in the very beginning. 

First, I need to look at the original groove provided. The kick (K) starts with "O--O", so the first 16th note is a hard kick. The snare (S) is silent in the first beat, starting with "----". The toms (T) are all dashes, meaning they're not played anywhere in the original.

The edit request is to add a snare hit and a tom hit at the very beginning. The "very beginning" would be the first 16th note of the first beat. 

For the snare, since the user didn't specify soft or hard, I'll go with a standard hard hit 'O'. But looking at the existing snare pattern, in the second beat they have "Oo-o", so maybe using 'O' is consistent. 

For the tom, the user wants a tom hit. The tom line is all dashes, so adding an 'O' (hard hit) on the first 16th note makes sense. 

Now, checking the original kick's first note is already an 'O', so adding the snare and tom there would layer them with the kick. That should give a strong start. 

I need to make sure that in the first beat's first 16th note, both S and T have their hits. So changing S's first character from '-' to 'O', and T's first character from '-' to 'O'. 

Let me verify the notation again. Each line's first four characters are the first beat. So the first beat of S becomes "O---" instead of "----", and T's first beat becomes "O---" instead of "----". 

That should do it. The rest of the groove remains the same. Let me double-check for any conflicts or mistakes. The hihats and other parts are unchanged. Looks good!
