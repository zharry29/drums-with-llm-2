Okay, let's see. The user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing any ride or kick elements. First, I need to recall the original drum notation provided and the specific instruments each line represents. The user's request is straightforward: eliminate the kick (K) and ride (R) parts.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

The kick (K) line has some hits like O and -, so I'll replace all characters in the K line with dashes to remove the kick. The ride (R) line has o-O- repeated, so I'll set all those to dashes as well. The other lines (S, H, T, C) don't involve ride or kick, so they stay unless they have other elements to remove, but the user only mentioned ride and kick. 

Wait, the user didn't mention anything about other cymbals like crash (C), toms (T), or hihat (H), so those can remain. Let me double-check each line:

- K line: All dashes now.
- S line: No ride or kick, so leave as is.
- H line: All dashes, so no change.
- T: Already empty.
- C: Also empty.
- R line: All dashes now.

So the final version should have K and R lines cleared out. Let me make sure I didn't miss any characters. The original K line had "O--O|----|--O-|----", so replacing each character with '-' gives "----|----|----|----". Similarly, R's "o-O-" sequences become "----" in each beat. 

I think that's all. Let me put it in the required format.
