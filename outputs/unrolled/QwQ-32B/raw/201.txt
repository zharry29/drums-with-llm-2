Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to include both snare and hihat. Looking at the original groove provided:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

First, I notice that the snare (S) is completely silent. The hihat (H) has some activity on the second and fourth beats, but maybe it's too sparse. The ride (R) is active, but the user wants to add snare and ensure hihat is present. 

Since the user mentioned "not only snare but also hihat," I need to make sure both are present. The existing hihat has x on the second and fourth beats of the second and fourth beats. To make it more consistent, maybe add some closed hihat hits (using X or x) on every beat. 

For the snare, I can place it on the typical backbeats, like the second and fourth beats. Let's use O for hard hits. So, on the second and fourth beats of each measure. Let's check the existing hihat: on the second beat of the second segment, there's an x. To avoid clashing, maybe the snare can be on those beats, and adjust the hihat to have closed hits (X) on those beats for a tighter feel.

Let me structure the snare line: S: ----|O---|----|O--- but need to check 16th notes. Each beat is four 16th notes. Let me spread it out. Maybe on the second and fourth beats, first 16th note. So S: ----|O---|----|O--- but written properly as four segments. Wait, each line is four beats separated by |. Each beat is four characters (16th notes). 

Original Hihat: H: ----|x---|----|x--- so on the second beat's first 16th note, and same on fourth. To add more hihat, maybe make it a steady closed hihat, like X on every 8th note. So H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X- but need to fit into 16th notes. Alternatively, X every 16th? Maybe X every 8th note (every two 16th notes). Let's see:

H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x- (closed on every 8th note, open on the third 16th? Not sure, but the original has x on the first 16th of beats 2 and 4. Maybe keep that but add more closed hits. Alternatively, set hihat to a steady closed pattern with some opens.

Alternatively, let's make the hihat more active. Let's do X on every 16th note except where there's an open. Wait, the user wants both snare and hihat, so maybe add a steady hihat closed (X) on all 16th notes except where the snare is. Or maybe alternate.

Alternatively, let's set hihat to X on every 8th note (every two 16th notes), so X-X-|X-X- etc. But need to fit into the notation. Let's try:

H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

That's four X's per beat, but each beat is four characters. Wait, each beat is four characters (16th notes). So X-X- would be X on first and third 16th notes of the beat, leaving second and fourth as -, but that might be too sparse. Alternatively, X every 16th note: XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX but that's too much. Maybe a standard hihat pattern like X on every 8th note (so two X per beat), so X-X-|X-X- etc.

For the snare, let's place O on the second and fourth beats, first 16th note. So in the S line:

S: ----|O---|----|O---

But need to check the length. Each line is four beats (so four segments separated by |). Each segment is four characters. So for the second beat (second segment), first character is O, rest -, so "O---". Similarly fourth segment "O---". That would give snare on the second and fourth beats. 

Wait, but the original hihat has an x on the second beat's first 16th note. If snare is also there, maybe that's okay, but maybe better to offset. Alternatively, put snare on the third 16th of the beat. Let me think. Let's try:

S: ----|O---|----|O--- 

So snare hits on the first 16th of beats 2 and 4. The hihat has an x on the same spot in beat 2 and 4. To avoid clashing, maybe change the hihat's x to X (closed) there. Let's adjust the H line:

Original H: ----|x---|----|x---

Changing that to X on the first 16th of beats 2 and 4, so H: ----|X---|----|X--- but then also adding more X elsewhere. Alternatively, make the hihat a steady closed pattern with some opens. Maybe:

H: X-X-|X-x-|X-X-|X-x-

Wait, that way on beat 2, third 16th is open (x), and same on beat 4. But need to ensure the hihat is active. Alternatively, perhaps a standard pattern like X on every 8th note, with an open on the 4th 16th of some beats. Not sure. Let's try:

H: X-X-|X-x-|X-X-|X-x-

This way, on beats 2 and 4, the third 16th is open, which might provide some variation. 

Putting it all together:

K: remains all ---- since original had no kick. The user didn't mention kick, so leave as is unless needed, but the edit request is about snare and hihat.

So final lines:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X-X-|X-x-|X-X-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Wait, but the ride is still there. The user didn't say to remove ride, just to add snare and ensure hihat. The original already had hihat, but maybe it's too minimal. The edited H line adds more hihat activity. The snare is now added on beats 2 and 4. 

Alternatively, maybe the snare could be more active. Let me check the original's ride pattern. The ride has x---|X-x- etc. Maybe the snare can have more hits. Alternatively, place snare on all four beats but softer? Or maybe O on 2 and 4, and some x or o on others. But the user's request is to have "not only snare but also hihat", so as long as snare is present, it's okay. 

Another consideration: the original hihat has x on beats 2 and 4 first 16th. If we put snare there, it's okay, but changing hihat to X there. So H: X---|X--- etc. Let me try that:

H: X---|X---|X---|X--- but that's too much. Maybe:

H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X- (closed on every 8th note) and then snare on 2 and 4. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants hihat to have more open hits. Let me think again. The original's hihat was only on the first 16th of beats 2 and 4. To add more hihat, maybe spread it out. 

Alternatively, set hihat to X on every 16th except where snare is. But maybe that's too busy. 

Alternatively, the simplest solution is to add snare on beats 2 and 4, and ensure hihat has more consistent hits. 

Finalizing:

Snare: O on beats 2 and 4 first 16th note.

Hihat: X on every 8th note (so X-X- for each beat), with the existing x on beats 2 and 4 third 16th? Hmm, perhaps:

H: X-X-|X-x-|X-X-|X-x- 

This way, on beats 2 and 4, the third 16th is open (x), and others closed. That adds some variation. 

So putting it all together:

@@@
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X-X-|X-x-|X-X-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

This should fulfill the request by adding snare on beats 2 and 4, and enhancing the hihat pattern to be more consistent with some open hits.
