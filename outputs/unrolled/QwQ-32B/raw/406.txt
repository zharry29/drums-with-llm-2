Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this drum groove edit. The user provided a drum notation example and explained each part. The task is to remove the hihat (H) and any cymbals (C and R). 

First, I need to look at the given groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user wants to eliminate hihat (H) and cymbals (C and R). So I should set all H, C, and R lines to all dashes. 

Looking at the original, the H line has X's, which are closed hits. Since the user doesn't want hihat, those need to be replaced with '-'. The C and R lines are already empty, but just to be safe, I'll confirm they are all dashes. 

The kick (K) and snare (S) lines are okay as they are, since the request is only about removing hihat and cymbals. So the edited version should keep K and S as they are, and set H, C, R to all '-'.

Wait, the user said "hihat or cymbal". Cymbals include both crash (C) and ride (R). So indeed, all those lines should be cleared. Let me double-check each line:

- K remains: O---|----|O---|----
- S remains: ----|O---|----|O---
- H becomes: ----|----|----|----
- T stays as is (no tom requested to remove, user didn't mention tom): ----|----|----|----
- C becomes: ----|----|----|----
- R becomes: ----|----|----|----

Wait, the user didn't mention toms, so T stays as it is. The original T line is all dashes, so that's fine. 

So putting it all together, the edited groove should have H, C, R lines all dashes. Let me write that out.
