Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. Let me first make sure I understand what they want. The user said, "I don't want any kick or hihat." 

Looking at the provided drum notation, the Kick (K) and Hihat (H) lines need to be cleared out. Let me check the original groove again:

Original Groove:
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So, the Kick has some hits, and the Hihat has a pattern with X and x characters. My task is to remove all the notes from the K and H lines. That means replacing every non '-' character in those lines with '-'.

Starting with the Kick (K) line:
Original K: O--O|----|--O-|----
After removing all hits, it should be all dashes:
K: ----|----|----|----

Now the Hihat (H) line:
Original H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
Removing all hits here as well:
H: ----|----|----|----

The other lines (S, T, C, R) should remain unchanged unless there's another instruction, but the user only mentioned Kick and Hihat. Let me double-check the Snare (S), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R) lines to ensure they stay the same. 

Snare has some Oo-o and -o--|O--o, which are okay. Toms, Crash, and Ride are all empty except maybe the Snare. Wait, the user didn't mention anything about the Snare or other instruments, so those stay. 

Wait, in the original problem statement, the user might have other instruments, but their request was specifically about Kick and Hihat. So, I just need to zero out K and H lines. 

Let me write the final edited groove with those changes. Making sure that each line except K and H remain as they are. 

Final Check:
- K line all dashes.
- H line all dashes.
- Others untouched.

Yes, that should do it.
