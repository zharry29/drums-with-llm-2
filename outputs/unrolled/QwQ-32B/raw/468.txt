Okay, let's see what the user is asking for here. They want me to edit a drum groove by removing the snare and kick parts. The original groove is provided in that drum notation format they showed earlier. 

First, I need to recall the structure of the drum notation. Each line represents a different drum component: K for kick, S for snare, H for hihat, T for toms, C for crash cymbal, and R for ride cymbal. Each line has 16 characters divided into four beats by the | symbols. The characters like O, o, X, x denote different hits or articulations, and - means no hit.

The user's edit request is to remove any snare (S) or kick (K) parts. So I need to go through each line of the given groove and set the K and S lines to all '-', effectively silencing those instruments. The other lines (H, T, C, R) should remain as they are unless they also need adjustment, but the request specifically mentions only snare and kick.

Looking at the provided groove:

Original K line: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
Original S line: ----|O---|----|O---  
Other lines (H, T, C, R) have their own patterns.

So, replacing K and S with all '-' should do it. Let me check each part:

For K: Replace every character in the K line with '-'. So instead of OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO, it becomes ----|----|----|----

For S: Similarly, replace all characters in the S line with '-'. The original has ----|O---|----|O---, so changing the O parts to - gives ----|----|----|----

The other lines (H, T, C, R) stay the same. Wait, the user didn't mention anything about hihat, toms, crashes, or ride, so those should remain. Let me double-check the original to ensure I'm not missing anything.

Original Toms (T) line is ----|----|----|----, so no change there. Crash (C) is O---|O---|O---|O---, so that stays. Hihat (H) is all ----, so no change. Ride (R) is also all ----. 

So the edited version should have K and S lines as all '-', keeping the rest as original. Let me write that out properly in the notation format between the @@@.

Wait, let me make sure the beats are correctly divided by |. Each line should have four beats (four groups of four characters). Let me confirm the K line after replacement is four groups of four '-', which it is: ----|----|----|----

Same for S line. That should be correct. Alright, I think that's all. The user just wants snare and kick removed, so this should fulfill the request.
