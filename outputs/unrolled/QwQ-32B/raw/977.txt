Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants "less notes," so I need to simplify the given groove by reducing the number of hits.

First, I'll look at each instrument line:

**Kick (K):** The original is "O---|O---|----|O---". That's hits on the first beat of each bar except the third. Maybe reduce some of these. Let's keep the main beats but maybe drop one or two. Maybe make it "O---|--O-|----|O---" to space them out more.

**Snare (S):** "----|----|O---|----". There's a snare on the third beat. Maybe keep that but remove others? Wait, there's only one snare hit here. Maybe leave it as is since it's already minimal.

**Hihat (H):** All dashes. No hits here, so nothing to reduce.

**Toms (T):** "O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-". Each beat has two hits (O and o). To reduce, maybe take out the softer hits (o) and leave just the hard hits. So each beat becomes "O---", resulting in "O---|O---|O---|O---".

**Crash (C) and Ride (R):** Both are dashes, so no action needed there.

Wait, but the user said "less notes," so maybe the Toms are the main area to cut. Changing Toms to just the hard hits would halve their notes. Let me check again. Original Toms have four hits per beat (O and o on each 16th note?), no, each beat is four 16th notes. So each "O-o-" is three hits? Wait, each beat is four characters. For example, "O-o-" is O, -, o, -? Wait, no, the format is four characters per beat. So "O-o-" would be O, -, o, -, but that's only three characters? Wait, maybe a typo. Wait the user's example shows "O---|----|O---|----" which is four characters per beat. So each beat is four characters. So "O-o-" would actually be "O - o -" over four 16th notes. So each beat in Toms has two hits (O and o). To reduce, maybe make each beat have just one hit. For example, "O---|O---|O---|O---".

Alternatively, maybe alternate or space them out. Let me adjust Toms first. 

Putting it all together:

K: Maybe reduce the kick to only the first and last beats: "O---|----|----|O---". But original had K on first, second, and fourth. Maybe keep two: first and fourth: "O---|----|----|O---".

Alternatively, the original K is O on beats 1, 2, and 4. To reduce, remove one. Let's go with "O---|--O-|----|O---" to spread them out.

Snare stays the same since it's only one hit.

Toms reduced to hard hits only: "O---|O---|O---|O---".

Final check: That should reduce the number of notes, especially in Toms. Let me write that out.
