Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants to "fill up the whole bar with double kick." The original groove has some kick hits, but to make it double kick throughout, I need to ensure every 16th note has a kick hit, probably alternating between hard (O) and soft (o) hits to create that double-time feel.

Looking at the original K line: "O--O|----|--O-|----". That's not continuous. To "fill up the whole bar with double kick," each 16th note should have either O or o. The standard for double kick is usually an alternating pattern like OoOo repeated. Since a bar has 16 notes, that would be four repetitions of OoOo, making "OoOo|OoOo|OoOo|OoOo".

Now, check other instruments. The edit request says "fill up with double kick," so other parts should stay unless conflicting. The snare (S) has some hits, the ride (R) has a pattern. Since the user didn't mention changing other parts, I should leave them as is except for the kick. 

Wait, in the original, the ride (R) has "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-". That's every beat. Maybe that's okay. The hihat (H) is all dashes, so no problem. The toms (T), crash (C) are also inactive. So replacing the K line with the double kick pattern while keeping others the same should work. Let me double-check the notation rules. Each four characters are a beat, so "OoOo" for each beat. That should cover all 16 notes. Yeah, that makes sense. So the final K line would be four times "OoOo" separated by |.
