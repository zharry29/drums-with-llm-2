Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a drum groove and wants to remove the kick and ride. Let me first parse the given drum notation.

Looking at the original groove:

K: ----|----|----|----  
S: ----|----|----|----  
H: ----|x---|----|x---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The user's request is to remove any kick (K) and ride (R). 

Starting with the Kick (K): All the K line entries are already dashes, so no changes needed there. Wait, but maybe I should double-check. The given K line is all dashes, so removing kick is already done. But since the instruction says to edit, perhaps I should confirm that K remains as all dashes.

Next, the Ride (R): The R line has "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-". To remove ride, I need to replace all those characters with dashes. So each character in the R line should become '-'.

So after editing, the R line becomes "----|----|----|----".

The other instruments (S, H, T, C) should remain as they are unless they were part of the request. Since the user only mentioned removing kick and ride, the snare (S), hihat (H), and crash (C) and toms (T) stay. 

Looking at the hihat (H): It has "----|x---|----|x---". Since the user didn't mention removing hihat, that stays. Similarly, the crash (C) is all dashes here, so no change there.

So the final edited groove should have K and R lines as all dashes, and the rest unchanged.

Wait, let me verify again. The user's request was "I don't want any kick or ride". So yes, K and R lines should be cleared. The H line is hihat, which is allowed. The S line is snare, also allowed. Toms and crash are already silent here.

So putting it all together, the edited groove should be:

K: all dashes  
S: unchanged  
H: unchanged  
T: unchanged  
C: unchanged  
R: all dashes

So the final answer should look like this in the @@@ block.
