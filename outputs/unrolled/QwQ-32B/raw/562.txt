Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand exactly what the user is asking for. They provided a drum groove in a specific notation and want me to edit it by removing any hihat (H) and ride (R) parts. 

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The user's request is to eliminate the hihat (H) and ride (R) elements. So I need to go through each line and set H and R to all '-' characters. Let's break it down:

1. **Kick (K):** This line remains as is since the user didn't mention removing kick.
2. **Snare (S):** Also stays because the request is about hihat and ride.
3. **Hihat (H):** Needs to be replaced with all '-'.
4. **Toms (T):** No changes needed unless specified, but the user didn't mention toms.
5. **Crash (C):** Similarly, no instruction to remove crashes, so leave as is.
6. **Ride (R):** Replace all entries with '-'.

Looking at the H line: It has "----|x---|----|x---". Changing that to all '-' gives "----|----|----|----".

For the R line: "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-" becomes "----|----|----|----".

I should double-check to ensure I didn't miss any other instruments. The user only mentioned hihat and ride, so the rest stay. Also, verifying the structure: each line has 16 characters (4 beats of 4 notes each). Let me confirm that after replacing, the lengths are correct.

Yes, replacing H and R with all '-' maintains the 16-character count. No other lines are altered. That should be it. The final drum groove should have the H and R lines cleared out.
