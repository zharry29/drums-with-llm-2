Okay, let's see. The user wants me to edit the given drum groove by adding a ride hit and a tom in the very beginning. Let me first look at the original groove to understand what's there.

The original K line (Kick drum) starts with "OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO". So the first beat has three O's and a dash. The S (Snare) starts with "----|O---|----|O---", so no snare in the first beat. The H (Hihat) is all dashes, meaning no hihat. Toms (T) are also all dashes, so no toms. Crash (C) has O's in each beat. Ride (R) is all dashes, so no ride initially.

The user wants a ride hit and a tom in the very beginning. The "very beginning" would be the first 16th note of the first beat. Since each beat is four 16th notes, the first character of each line corresponds to the first 16th note of that beat.

First, for the ride (R). The ride line is currently all dashes. To add a hit on the first 16th note, I need to replace the first '-' in the R line with an articulation. Since the user mentioned "ride hit", probably a hard open hit on the bell, which is 'O'. So the first character of R's first beat (before the first |) should be 'O'.

Next, the tom (T). The tom line is all dashes. Adding a tom hit on the first 16th note would mean replacing the first '-' in T's first beat with an articulation. A hard hit is 'O', so let's use that unless specified otherwise. So the first character of T's first beat becomes 'O'.

Wait, but the user said "ride hit and tom in the very beginning". So both should be on the first 16th note. Let me confirm:

Original R starts with "----|----|----|----", so changing first to "O---|----|----|----".

Original T starts with "----|----|----|----", changing to "O---|----|----|----".

But I need to check if that's allowed. Are there any conflicts? The kick has "OOO-" in the first beat, so the first three 16th notes have kicks. Adding a tom and ride on the first 16th note is okay, as multiple drums can be hit simultaneously.

So the edited lines would be:

R: O---|----|----|----

T: O---|----|----|----

Let me double-check the user's request: "ride hit and tom in the very beginning". Yes, that's covered. The rest of the groove remains the same. Let me make sure no other changes are needed. The kick and crash remain as they are. The snare and hihat are still as original. So the final edited groove should have those two changes.
