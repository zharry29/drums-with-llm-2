Okay, the user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing the kick and hihat parts. Let me start by looking at the given drum notation.

First, I need to recall the instruments each line corresponds to. K is kick, S is snare, H is hihat, T is toms, C is crash, and R is ride. The user said they don't want any kick or hihat, so I need to set all the characters in the K and H lines to '-'.

Looking at the original groove provided:

@@@
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

Wait, actually, in the given groove here, the K line is already all dashes. But the H line has some x's. So I need to clear out the H line. Let me check each line:

- K line is already empty, so no change there.
- H line has "----|x---|----|x---", so I need to replace all those x's with '-' to remove the hihat.
- The other lines (S, T, C, R) should stay as they are unless they have kick or hihat, but since the user only asked for those two, I leave the rest untouched.

Wait, the user's edit request is to remove kick and hihat. The K line is already empty, so just need to clear H. Let me make sure that's all. The R line has some activity, but that's ride cymbal, which is allowed. The T and C lines are empty here. So the edited version should have H set to all dashes.

So the final groove should look like:

K: all dashes (already done)
S: unchanged
H: all dashes
T: unchanged
C: unchanged
R: unchanged

So replacing the H line's x's with '-', resulting in:

H: ----|----|----|----

Let me double-check the original H line: "----|x---|----|x---". Changing those x's to '-' gives four beats of all dashes. Yep, that's correct. The rest stay the same. So the final notation should be as above.
