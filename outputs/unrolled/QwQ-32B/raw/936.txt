Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the snare on beat 4 but keep everything else the same. Let me start by understanding the original groove.

Looking at the given drum notation:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

First, I need to identify where the snare (S line) is hitting on beat 4. Each beat is separated by |, so the fourth beat is the last segment after the third |. The S line's fourth beat is "O--o". Wait, actually, each beat is four 16th notes, so the fourth beat here is "O--o"? Let me parse it again:

The S line is divided as:
Beat 1: ----
Beat 2: Oo-o
Beat 3: -o--
Beat 4: O--o

Wait, no. Wait, the notation is structured as four beats, each with four 16th notes. The S line is written as "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o". Breaking it down:

- Beat 1: "----" (no snare)
- Beat 2: "Oo-o" (first three 16th notes have O, o, o, and the fourth is '-')
Wait, no, each beat is four characters. Let me check again. The S line is "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o". So each beat is four characters:

Beat 1: "----" (all four 16th notes are rests)
Beat 2: "Oo-o" – Wait, that's only three characters? Wait no, maybe I miscounted. Let me count the characters in S's line:

Original S line: "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o"

Breaking it down between the |:

First part: "----" (4 characters)
Second: "Oo-o" – Hmm, that's 4? Let's see: O o - o? Wait, "Oo-o" has four characters? O, o, -, o? Wait maybe there's a typo here. Wait the user input might have a typo, but I should go with what's given.

Wait, let me count each segment. The S line is written as "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o". Each segment between | must be four characters. Let me check:

First segment: "----" (4)
Second: "Oo-o" – O o - o? That's four characters (O, o, -, o)
Third: "-o--" (four)
Fourth: "O--o" (O, -, -, o) – four.

So beat 4 of the snare is "O--o". The user wants to remove the snare on beat 4. So beat 4 of the S line should be all '-'.

So the original S line's fourth beat is "O--o", which has a hit on the first 16th note (O) and the last (o). To remove all snare on beat 4, those should become '-'.

So the new S line would be:

S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|----

Other lines remain as they are, since the user said everything else is fine. Let me check the other lines to confirm:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

So the R line's fourth beat is "o-O-", which is part of the ride cymbal. Since the user only mentioned snare on beat 4, those should stay.

Therefore, the edited groove should have the S line's fourth beat all '-'.

Putting it all together:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
