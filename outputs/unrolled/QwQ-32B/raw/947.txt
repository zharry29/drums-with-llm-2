Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the ride cymbal on beat 4 while keeping everything else the same. 

First, I need to understand the current setup. The given groove has the Ride (R) line as "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-". Each beat is separated by |, so beat 4 is the last segment before the end. The R line's fourth beat is "o-O-", which means there are hits on the first and third 16th notes of that beat.

The user's request is to eliminate the ride on beat 4. That means I need to replace the characters in the fourth beat of the R line with '-' to indicate no hits. The rest of the R line and all other instruments should stay unchanged.

Looking at the R line: the fourth beat is "o-O-". Changing each character to '-' where there were hits. The first character 'o' becomes '-', the second '-' stays, the third 'O' becomes '-', and the last '-' remains. So the fourth beat becomes "----".

Putting it all together, the new R line would be "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|----". Let me double-check the other lines to ensure nothing else was touched. K, S, H, T, and C lines remain exactly as they were. 

Wait, let me confirm the positions again. Each beat is four 16th notes. The fourth beat of R was "o-O-", so replacing the non '-' characters with '-' gives "----". Yep, that's correct. 

No other edits needed. The final groove should reflect this change only.
