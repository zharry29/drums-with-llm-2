Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to include not only the kick drum but also the ride cymbal. Looking at the original groove:

Right now, the kick (K) and snare (S) are active, with the hihat (H) closed hits on every 16th note. The ride (R) is completely silent. The task is to add ride hits without removing the kick. 

First, I need to decide where to place the ride. Since the kick is already on beats 1 and 3 of each measure (the "O---" and "O---" parts), I can complement that with ride hits on the offbeats or maybe a steady pattern. The hihat is doing eighth notes, so maybe the ride can add some variation.

A common approach is to have the ride play on the "&" of each beat (the eighth notes) but since hihat is already doing that, maybe a different pattern. Alternatively, quarter notes on the ride could work. Let's see:

The kick is on the first 16th of each beat (positions 1 and 5, 9, 13). To avoid clashing, maybe place ride hits on the 3rd 16th of each beat? Or alternate between kick and ride.

Alternatively, a steady ride pattern like "X-X-" for each beat (every other 16th note). Let me try that. Each beat is four 16ths. So for each | segment:

If I use "X-X-" for each beat, that would be X on the 1st and 3rd 16ths. But the kick is on the 1st, so maybe that's okay. Let's see:

R: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

But the kick is on the first 16th of the first and third beats. So on beat 1, kick and ride hit together. That might be fine, but perhaps the user wants ride to not clash. Alternatively, offset it.

Alternatively, ride on the 2nd and 4th 16ths: "-X-X". So R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X. That way, ride is on the offbeats, not clashing with kick.

Alternatively, a swung or syncopated pattern. Let me think of a simple eighth note pattern on ride. Since the hihat is doing X--- for each beat (maybe that's every quarter note?), Wait, looking back, the original hihat is X--- for each beat. Wait, the H line is X---|X---|X---|X---, so each beat is X followed by three dashes. So that's a quarter note on each beat. So the hihat is closed hits on the downbeats. The ride can do eighth notes to fill in the space.

So for the ride, maybe a steady eighth note pattern. Since each beat is four 16ths, eighth notes would be every two 16ths. So for each beat, the ride could be X-X- (since two 16ths make an eighth). So every other 16th. That would give a steady eighth note ride.

So R: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

But let me check if that works with the kick. The first beat's kick is on the first 16th, so the ride would hit 1 and 3. The kick is on 1, so they coincide there. Maybe that's okay, but if the user wants the ride to be separate, maybe alternate.

Alternatively, starting the ride on the second 16th: -X-X for each beat. Then the first hit is on the "&" of the beat. That might spread things out better.

So R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X

This way, the ride hits on 2 and 4 of each beat's 16ths, which would complement the kick on 1 and the hihat on 1. That might create a better groove without too much overlap.

Alternatively, using X on the first and third 16ths (X-X-) but that's the same as before. Hmm.

Another option: a quarter note pattern on the ride, so every four 16ths (i.e., every beat). But that might be too sparse. 

Alternatively, a mix of X and x (hard and soft) for variation. Since the user didn't specify, maybe just stick to X for simplicity.

Let me try the -X-X pattern. So each beat in R would be -X-X. Let's see:

Breaking down the first measure:

Beat 1 (first segment): K is O---, H is X---, R would be -X-X. So:

16ths 1: K O, H X, R -
2: H -, R X
3: R X
Wait, no, let's parse each beat's four 16ths. For the first beat (O---|...):

R's first beat is -X-X. So positions:

1: -
2: X
3: -
4: X

Wait, no: -X-X would be positions 1: -, 2: X, 3: X, 4: -? Wait, no. Wait the notation is four characters per beat. So "-X-X" would mean first 16th is -, second is X, third is -, fourth is X? Wait no, the characters are in order. So "-X-X" is:

1st 16th: -
2nd: X
3rd: -
4th: X

Wait no, the four characters are the four 16ths of the beat. So "-X-X" would be:

1: -, 2: X, 3: -, 4: X. That's an eighth note on the second and fourth 16ths, which is an eighth note triplet? Wait no, two hits per beat, spaced every two 16ths. That's eighth notes. So that's a steady eighth note pattern.

Alternatively, maybe a more syncopated pattern like X-X- or something else.

Alternatively, to add some variation, maybe alternate between X and x (hard and soft). For example, X-x- or something. But since the user's instruction is just to add ride, maybe keep it simple.

I think the safest bet is to add a steady eighth note pattern on the ride without clashing too much with kick. Let's go with R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X.

So the edited groove would be:

K remains the same, S same, H same, T still empty, C same, and R filled with -X-X on each beat.

Wait, let me write it out:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X

But I need to ensure that each line has exactly 16 characters (4 per beat, 4 beats). Let's check:

Each R line segment is four characters separated by |. The pattern "-X-X" for each beat gives four characters, so yes. So the entire R line would be "-X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X".

Alternatively, maybe the user wants more activity. Alternatively, a "X-X-" pattern so that the ride hits on the first and third 16ths, but that would have the first hit on the downbeat with kick. Maybe that's acceptable. Let me see both options.

Option 1: Ride on the "and" of each beat (positions 2 and 4):

R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X

Option 2: Ride on 1 and 3:

R: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

Which is better? Since the kick is on 1, maybe Option 1 keeps the kick as the main pulse and ride adds the offbeats, which is common. So I'll go with Option 1.

Thus, the final edited groove would have R filled with -X-X for each beat.
