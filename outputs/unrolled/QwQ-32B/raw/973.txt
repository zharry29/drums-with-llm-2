Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the tom hit on beat 4, but keep everything else the same. First, I need to look at the given drum groove and identify where the tom (T) is playing on beat 4.

Looking at the T line in the provided groove:
T: ----|----|----|----

Hmm, wait a second. The T line already has all dashes, meaning there are no tom hits in the original groove. The user's request says to remove the tom on beat 4, but if there's nothing there, maybe there's a mistake. Let me double-check the other lines to make sure.

The Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Crash (C), and Ride (R) lines all have their own patterns, but the Toms (T) line is completely silent. So, perhaps the user thought there was a tom on beat 4, but actually, there isn't. In that case, the groove is already as requested. However, maybe I misread the original. Let me check again.

Original T line:
T: ----|----|----|----

Yes, definitely no hits. So, the edit doesn't change anything. But the user might have intended another instrument, like the ride or snare? Wait, the edit specifically mentions "tom on beat 4". Since there's no tom hit, the correct response is to leave it as is. Therefore, the edited version remains the same as the original. But to comply with the user's request explicitly, I'll present the same groove between the @@@, confirming that no changes were needed.
