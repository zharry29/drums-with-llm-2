Okay, let's see what the user is asking for here. They provided a drum groove in the specified notation and want me to edit it by removing the kick drum on beat 4 while keeping everything else the same.

First, I need to recall the structure of the drum notation. Each line represents an instrument, and each beat is separated by |. Each beat has four 16th notes. The user's groove is:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The edit request is to drop the kick on beat 4. Let me look at the Kick (K) line. The fourth beat is |--o-, so the last character of the fourth beat is 'o'. To remove the kick on beat 4, I need to replace that 'o' with '-'.

Breaking down the K line:

Beat 1: o---
Beat 2: |--o-
Beat 3: |o---
Beat 4: |--o-

Wait, actually, each part after the | is a beat. So the K line is divided into four beats:

1. o---
2. --o- (Wait, no. Let me parse it correctly. The K line is written as "o---|--o-|o---|--o-". So each beat is four characters. Let me split it properly:

First beat: o---
Second beat: --o- (Wait, no. Wait the line is K: o---|--o-|o---|--o- so each segment after | is a beat. So:

Beat 1: o---
Beat 2: --o-
Beat 3: o---
Beat 4: --o-

Wait, the fourth beat is --o-? Because the last segment is |--o- so the fourth beat is --o-? Wait, no. Let me parse again:

The K line is written as "o---|--o-|o---|--o-". Split by |, that's four parts:

1. o---
2. --o-
3. o---
4. --o-

Wait, but that's not right because the user's input might have a typo. Wait, the original K line is:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-

Wait each beat is four characters. Let me check each segment:

First segment: o--- (four characters)
Second: --o- (four characters)
Third: o--- (four)
Fourth: --o- (four). Wait that would make the fourth beat's last character the 'o' on the fourth 16th note of beat 4. But the user wants to remove the kick on beat 4. So beat 4's entire kick part should be replaced with '----'? Because "I don't want kick on beat 4".

Wait, the user says "I don't want kick on beat 4 but everything else is fine." So the entire fourth beat for the kick should be silent. The original K line's fourth beat is --o- (so the third 16th note of beat 4 has a soft hit). So to remove all kick on beat 4, that beat should become ----.

So the original K line is:

o--- (beat 1)
|--o- (beat 2)
|o--- (beat3)
|--o- (beat4)

Wait, the fourth beat is --o- (the fourth segment is --o-). So beat4's kick is "--o-". To remove all kick on beat4, replace that with "----".

So the new K line would be:

K: o---|--o-|o---|----

Then, check the other instruments. The user says everything else is fine, so S, H, T, C, R remain the same.

Let me verify each line:

S remains: ----|X---|--X-|----
H remains: ----|x---|----|x---
T remains: ----|----|----|----
C remains: ----|----|----|----
R remains: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Wait, but in the original R line, the fourth beat is X-x-, which is okay because the user only wanted to remove kick. So the final K line after edit is:

K: o---|--o-|o---|----

Putting it all together, the corrected drum notation should have the fourth beat of K as ----.
