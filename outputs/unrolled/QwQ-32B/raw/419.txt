Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. The user said, "I don't want any hihat or kick." Let me look at the given drum groove first.

The original groove is:

@@@
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Breaking it down line by line:

- **K (Kick drum):** There are hits on the first, second, and fourth beats. The user wants no kick, so I need to replace all those O's with dashes (-).
  
- **S (Snare drum):** The snare is only hitting on the third and fourth beats of the third and fourth parts. Since the user didn't mention snare, I leave it as is unless there's a mistake. Wait, the request was only about hihat and kick, so snare stays.
  
- **H (Hihat):** Currently all dashes, so no problem here. But maybe the user wants to ensure there's nothing? It's already clear.
  
- **T (Toms):** The toms have a pattern. The user didn't mention toms, so leave them.
  
- **C (Crash cymbal) and R (Ride cymbal):** Both are silent, so no changes needed there.

Wait, the user said "no hihat or kick," so I just need to zero out the K line and make sure H is also clear. Wait, in the original, H is already all dashes. So the main change is the K line. Let me confirm each part.

Original K line: "O---|O---|----|O---". Changing all O's to dashes gives "----|----|----|----".

So the edited version should have K line all dashes, and H remains as it is (already empty). The rest stay the same. Let me put that together.
