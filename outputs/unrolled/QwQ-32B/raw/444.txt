Okay, let me tackle this edit request. The user wants to remove all cymbals and snare from the given drum groove. 

First, I need to recall which lines correspond to which instruments. The given drum groove has lines for Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R). The user mentioned removing cymbals, which include Crash (C) and Ride (R), and the snare (S). 

Looking at the provided groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

So, I need to set the S, C, and R lines to all '-' characters. The Kick (K) and Hihat (H) can stay unless specified, but the user didn't mention hihat. Wait, the request says "no cymbal or snare," so hihat is okay unless it's considered a cymbal. Wait, checking the instrument list: H is hihat, which is a closed hi-hat, but cymbals are Crash (C) and Ride (R). So hihat is separate. So leave H as is, unless the user counts hihat as cymbal? The user's request specifically says "cymbal" so probably just crash and ride. So H can stay.

So, set S, C, R to all '-'.

Let me check each line:

- K remains the same.
- S line becomes all '-'.
- H remains as it is (since it's hihat, not a cymbal per user's request).
- T remains as it is (toms are okay).
- C becomes all '-'.
- R becomes all '-'.

So the edited version should look like:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, but the original T line was all dashes, so that's fine. Let me double-check the user's request again. They said "no cymbal or snare". So crash (C), ride (R), and snare (S) are removed. Hihat (H) is allowed. 

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer should have S, C, R lines cleared.
