Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a drum notation example and a specific groove, then asked to remove the cymbal on beat 4 while keeping everything else the same. 

First, I need to understand the given groove structure. The groove has six lines for different drums: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R). Each line has 16th notes divided into four beats separated by |. 

Looking at the original groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
S: ----|X---|--X-|----  
H: ----|x---|----|x---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-  

The user wants to remove the cymbal on beat 4. The cymbals here are represented by the Crash (C) and Ride (R) lines. In the original, the Ride (R) has "X-x-" on beat 4. The Crash (C) line is all dashes, so no crash on any beat. So the cymbal sound on beat 4 is from the Ride. 

To comply with the request, I need to set the fourth beat of the Ride (R) to all dashes. The current R line is: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-. The fourth beat is "X-x-", so replacing that with "----" would remove it. 

I should check if there are any other cymbals (like Crash) on beat 4. The Crash line (C) is all dashes, so no issue there. 

Therefore, the edited Ride line should be: x---|X-x-|x---|----. 

The rest of the lines remain unchanged. Let me double-check each part to ensure only the specified part is altered. 

Yes, that should do it. The final groove should have the fourth beat of the Ride cleared, removing the cymbal there while keeping everything else as before.
