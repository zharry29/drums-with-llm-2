Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any cymbals and toms from the given groove. Let me start by understanding the original groove structure.

Looking at the provided notation:

- **Kick (K):** O---|---o|O-O-|----
- **Snare (S):** ----|O---|----|O---
- **Hihat (H):** --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- **Toms (T):** All dashes, so no toms here.
- **Crash (C):** O---|----|----|----
- **Ride (R):** All dashes, so no ride.

The user's request is to remove cymbals (Crash and Ride) and Toms. Since Toms are already silent, I just need to eliminate the Crash and Ride lines. 

Wait, the Crash has some hits in the first beat (O---). So I'll set all Crash characters to '-' and keep Ride as it is (already empty). Also, check if there are any other cymbals, but in this case, only Crash is active. 

The Hihat is allowed unless specified, but the user didn't mention hihat. The instruction says "no cymbal or tom," so hihat is a closed/open hit, which is part of the hihat, not a cymbal. Since cymbals here refer to crash and ride, hihat stays. 

So the edited groove should have K, S, H as before, and C and R set to all dashes. Let me double-check each line:

- K remains unchanged.
- S remains.
- H remains since it's hihat, not a cymbal.
- T is already empty.
- C becomes all '-'.
- R is already empty.

Yes, that should do it. Just zero out the Crash line.
