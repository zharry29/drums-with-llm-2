Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any snare or hihat parts. Let me start by looking at the original groove provided.

First, I'll go through each line of the given drum notation. The user mentioned the instruments: K is kick, S is snare, H is hihat, T is toms, C is crash, and R is ride. The edit request is to eliminate snare (S) and hihat (H), so I need to set those lines to all '-' characters. 

Looking at the original K line: "O---|----|O---|----". That's the kick drum, which should stay as is since it's not being removed. The S line is "----|O---|----|O---", so replacing all non '-' characters with '-' gives "----|----|----|----". 

The H line is "X---|X---|X---|X---". Since the user doesn't want hihat, this should also become all '-'. The T, C, and R lines are already empty except for C which has no hits, so they stay. 

Wait, checking the original again: the C and R lines are empty. So after removing S and H, the new groove should have K as original, S and H as all '-', and others unchanged. Let me double-check each line to ensure no snare or hihat notes remain. 

Yes, replacing the S and H lines with all '-' will fulfill the request. The kick and any other instruments (toms, crashes, ride) that were present stay, but since in the original there were no toms or crashes/ride hits except maybe C? Wait, in the given groove, C is all '----', so nothing there. 

So the final edited groove should have K as is, S and H lines all '-', and the rest as original. Let me write that out to make sure it's correct.
