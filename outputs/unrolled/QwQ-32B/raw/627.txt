Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a cymbal hit and kick in the very beginning. The original groove has:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Looking at the first beat (before the first |), the kick has "o---", which is a soft hit on the first 16th note. To add a kick, maybe make it a hard hit (O) instead. 

For the cymbal hit, the user didn't specify which cymbal, but since Crash (C) and Ride (R) are options. The original has Ride (R) active with "x---", which is a soft closed hit. Maybe add a Crash (C) hit on the first note. But since Crash is more impactful, maybe using O for a hard hit there. Alternatively, if they prefer Ride, but it's already playing. Let me check the user's request again: they want a cymbal hit and kick in the very beginning. Since C is empty initially, adding a Crash hit there makes sense.

So, first note of Kick: change the 'o' to 'O' for a harder kick. First note of Crash (C) should have an 'O' to add the cymbal hit. The original C line is all dashes, so change first character to O.

Let me verify:

Original K first beat: o---
After: O---

Original C first beat: ----
After: O---

That should do it. The rest can stay the same unless conflicting, but since C wasn't playing before, this should be okay. The user didn't mention removing anything else, so just those two changes.
