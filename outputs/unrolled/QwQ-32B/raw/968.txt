Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the tom hit on beat 4, but keep everything else the same. 

First, I need to look at the given drum notation. The original groove is:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user's request is specifically about the Toms (T line). The Toms line has "O-o-" for each beat. Since each set of four characters represents a beat, the fourth beat here is "O-o-". Wait, actually, each line is divided into four beats by the | symbol. Let me parse this correctly.

Breaking down the Toms line:
- First beat: O-o-
- Second beat: O-o-
- Third beat: O-o-
- Fourth beat: O-o-

So each beat is four 16th notes. The fourth beat of the Toms is "O-o-", meaning there's a hit on the first 16th note (O) and a softer hit on the third (o). The user wants no tom on beat 4. That means the fourth beat's Toms entry should be changed to all dashes.

So the corrected Toms line should be:
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|----

But wait, the original T line was "O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-". Replacing the last segment with "----" would remove all hits on the fourth beat. Let me check again to make sure I'm not miscounting the beats. 

Yes, each segment between | is a beat. The fourth beat is the last segment, so replacing that with "----" would eliminate any tom hits there. The rest of the T line remains the same. 

Now, I need to ensure that all other instruments (K, S, H, C, R) stay exactly as they are. Let me double-check each line:

Kick (K) remains unchanged:
K: O---|O---|----|O---

Snare (S) stays the same:
S: ----|----|O---|----

Hihat (H) is still:
H: ----|----|----|----

Crash (C) and Ride (R) also remain untouched.

So the final edited groove should look like this with the Toms adjusted. I need to present it within the @@@ markers as specified.
