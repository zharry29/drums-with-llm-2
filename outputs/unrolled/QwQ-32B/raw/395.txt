Okay, let's see. The user wants me to remove any snare or hihat from the given drum groove. Let me first look at the original groove provided.

Starting with the Kick (K line): "O--O|----|--O-|----". That's okay, since the user didn't ask to remove kick. The Snare (S line) has some hits: "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o". I need to eliminate all of those. So I'll replace the S line with all dashes.

Next, the Hihat (H line) is all dashes except maybe some closed hits? Wait, the original H line here is "----|----|----|----", so actually there's nothing there. But the user still wants to ensure no hihat, so even if there were, we remove them. Since it's already empty, that line stays as is.

Toms (T) and Crash (C) and Ride (R) are okay as they are unless instructed otherwise. The user only mentioned snare and hihat. The Ride (R) has "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-", which is allowed since the request doesn't mention ride. Wait, the user said "no snare or hihat", so Ride is still okay. So only S and H lines need to be cleared.

Wait, checking the original again: The H line was already empty. So the edited version should have S as all dashes and H remains dashes. Let me confirm each line:

Original S: "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o" â†’ becomes "----|----|----|----".

H is already "----|----|----|----".

So the final groove should have K, T, C, R as before, with S and H cleared. Let me structure that properly.
