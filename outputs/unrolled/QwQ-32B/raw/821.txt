Okay, let's see. The user wants a ride hit and hihat in the very beginning of the drum groove provided. Let me first look at the given drum groove to understand what needs to be modified.

The original drum groove is:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user's request is to add a ride hit and hihat at the very beginning. The "very beginning" would be the first 16th note of the first beat, which is the first character in each line before the first |.

Looking at the Hihat (H) line: the first beat is "--o-". The first three characters are '-', '-', 'o', '-'. So the first hit on the hihat is on the third 16th note (the 'o'), which is a soft open hit. To add a hihat in the very beginning, I need to place a hit on the first 16th note. Since the existing hihat pattern uses 'o' (soft open) and maybe some closed hits (X or x), but the user didn't specify the type, I'll go with the default closed hit (X or x). Since the rest of the hihat uses lowercase for soft, maybe starting with a soft closed hit (x) would be better for continuity.

For the ride (R), the current first beat is "----", meaning no hits. To add a ride hit at the beginning, the first character should be an 'O' (hard hit on the bell) or 'o' (soft). Since the user didn't specify soft or hard, maybe 'O' is a good choice for a strong start.

So modifying the first beat of H and R:

H's first beat changes from "--o-" to "x-o-" (assuming starting with a soft closed hit on the first 16th note). 

R's first beat changes from "----" to "O---" (hard hit on the bell at the first 16th note).

Wait, but I should check if there's any conflict. The Kick (K) starts with "O---", so on the first 16th note, there's a kick hit (O) and the hihat's x. That's okay, they can play together. The ride's O on the same note would add a cymbal sound with the kick and hihat, which is common in drum grooves. 

Let me also check the existing hihat pattern. The original H line starts with "--o-", so adding an 'x' at the first position makes it "x-o-", which introduces a closed hihat on the first note, then open on the third. That should work. 

The ride's first beat becomes "O---", so the first note is a ride bell hit. 

So the modified lines would be:

H: x-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-  
R: O---|----|----|----

I need to ensure that the total characters per line are 16 (four beats of four notes each). Let me count:

Original H line: "--o-" (4) followed by three more beats (each 4 chars) makes 16. Changing first to "x-o-" (still 4), so that's okay.

R line was "----|----|----|----" (16), changing first to "O---" keeps it at 16.

So the final edited groove should look like this:

@@@
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

Wait, but the user might want the hihat to start with a closed hit (X instead of x?) but since the rest of the hihat uses lowercase o, maybe x (soft closed) is better. Alternatively, maybe the user prefers a harder hit. Hmm. The original H line has 'O-o-' in the second beat, so perhaps the user is using O for open hits. Since the first hihat note is being added, maybe starting with a closed hit (X or x). Since the rest of the hihat's open hits are 'o', maybe a soft closed (x) is better to match softness. 

Alternatively, maybe the first note could be an open hit (O), but the original starts with '--o-', so the first open hit is on the third note. Adding an open on the first would change the pattern, but the user just wants a hit, so closed is safer. 

I think my initial change is correct. Let me confirm once again. 

Yes, so the edited version should have those changes.
