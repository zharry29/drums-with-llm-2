Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to include both snare and hihat, which it partially does, but the hihat is missing. Let me look at the given groove first.

Starting with the Kick (K): It has some hits like O--O and --O-, so that's the foundation. The Snare (S) has some Oo-o and -o-- which are okay, but the Hihat (H) is all dashes. The Toms (T) and Crash (C) are also inactive, and Ride (R) has some o-O- patterns.

The main issue here is the absence of hihat. The user's request is to add hihat in addition to the existing snare. So I need to figure out where to place the hihat hits. Typically, hihats are played on every 8th or 16th note, often closed (X/x) for a tighter sound or open (O/o) for a splashier one.

Looking at the existing snare and kick, maybe a steady hihat pattern would work. Let's see the structure of each beat. The groove has four beats separated by |. Let me break it down beat by beat:

First beat: K: O--, S: ----, H: ----, R: o-O-  
Second beat: K: ----, S: Oo-o, H: ----, R: o-O-  
Third beat: K: --O-, S: -o--, H: ----, R: o-O-  
Fourth beat: K: ----, S: O--o, H: ----, R: o-O-  

Since the ride is already doing a pattern (o-O-), maybe the hihat can complement it. Let's go with a closed hihat (x) on every 16th note. That would give a steady rhythm. Alternatively, maybe alternate between closed and open, but since the user just wants it added, simplicity might be better.

Let me try adding X on every 16th note for hihat. So each beat would have XXXX. But looking at the ride's pattern (o-O-), which is o on the first 16th, O on the third. Maybe syncopate the hihat. Alternatively, maybe closed hihat on every 8th note. Let's see:

Hihat could be x-x- for each beat (every other 16th note). That would create a typical backbeat feel. Let me try that across all four beats:

H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-  

That should add a steady hihat pattern without clashing with the ride. Let me check if that's allowed. The user's instruction was to add hihat, so this should work. The snare is already present, so the edit meets the requirement. Let me make sure there are no typos. Each beat for H should be x-x- separated by |.

So the final edited groove would have the H line filled with x-x- for each beat. The other lines remain the same except adding the H line. Let me write that out.
