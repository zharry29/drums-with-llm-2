Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any snare or cymbal parts. Let me look at the original groove first.

Starting with the Kick (K): "O--O|----|--O-|----". That's fine, no changes needed there since it's just kick. 

Snare (S) has "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o". Since the user doesn't want snare, I need to replace all those with dashes. 

Hihat (H) is already all dashes, so that's okay. 

Toms (T) are also silent, so no problem there. 

Crash (C) and Ride (R) are both empty except for the Ride which has "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-". Since Ride is a cymbal, I need to clear that line too.

So, the plan is: set Snare (S) and Ride (R) lines to all dashes. Check if there are any other cymbals, like Crash (C) which is already empty. 

Wait, the user said "no cymbal", so Crash (C) is also to be removed. The original C line is "----|----|----|----", which is already silent. So no changes there.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have S and R lines as all dashes. Let me double-check each line to ensure nothing's missed. Yep, looks good. The Kick and Toms remain as they were, and the rest are cleared.
