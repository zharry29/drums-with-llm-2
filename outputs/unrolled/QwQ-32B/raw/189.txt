Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to include not only tom but also snare. Looking at the given groove:

First, check the current instruments:
- Kick (K) has some soft hits.
- Snare (S) has X and x (sidestick) but no O or o (the main snare hits).
- Hihat (H) is active but not the issue here.
- Toms (T) are completely silent.
- Ride (R) has some activity.

The problem is that the snare is only using sidestick (X and x), so the main snare isn't present. Also, toms need to be added. The request says "not only tom but also snare," which I think means both should be added. Wait, maybe the user wants to replace the sidestick with regular snare and add toms? Or perhaps they want both sidestick and regular snare?

Looking back at the instruction: "The groove should have not only tom but also snare." The original groove already has snare (S line has X and x, which are sidestick hits). So maybe the user wants to add regular snare hits (O or o) in addition to the existing sidestick. Also, the toms are missing entirely, so they need to be added.

So the steps are:
1. Add snare hits (O or o) to the S line in places where it's currently empty or where sidestick is used.
2. Add tom hits (O or o) to the T line where appropriate, maybe complementing the kick or snare.

Looking at the S line:
Current S: ----|X---|--X-|----
So in the first beat, nothing; second beat has X on the first 16th; third beat has X on the third; fourth beat nothing.

To add regular snare, maybe place O hits on the typical snare positions. In a typical groove, snare might be on beats 2 and 4. Let's see the structure of the bar. Since each | separates beats, so each segment is a beat (4 16th notes). Let's see the existing kick and hihat to find the rhythm.

Kick line: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
So kick hits on the first 16th of first beat, then on the second 16th of second beat, etc. Hihat is ----|x---|----|x---, so closed hits on the second beat's first 16th and fourth beat's first 16th.

Maybe the snare should hit on beat 2 and 4. Let's map the beats:

Beat 1: K has o on first 16th. S is empty here. Maybe add a snare hit on beat 1's 3rd or 4th?

Beat 2: K has --o- (third 16th). S has X on first 16th. Maybe add a snare hit on the 2nd or 4th?

Alternatively, maybe place snare on the 2nd and 4th beats. Let's think of the fourth beat: the user's example might want a snare hit there.

Alternatively, let's look at the ride pattern (R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-). The ride has a pattern that might suggest the snare placement.

Alternatively, since the user wants "not only tom but also snare," maybe the snare was only sidestick and needs regular hits. So in S line, replace some X with O, or add O in other positions.

Let me try modifying the S line to include regular snare hits. For example, adding O on beat 2 and 4. Let's see:

Original S: 
Beat1: ----
Beat2: X---
Beat3: --X-
Beat4: ----

To add snare hits on beats 2 and 4, maybe:

Beat2: O on the 3rd or 4th? Let's say beat2's third 16th (since the kick is on third). Or maybe second?

Alternatively, common snare placement on beat 2 and 4. Let's say on the second 16th of beat2 and fourth beat's second?

Alternatively, perhaps place snare on the 2nd and 4th beats' downbeats (first 16th of beat2 and beat4). So in beat2's first 16th, replace X with O? But X is sidestick. Maybe keep X and add an O elsewhere.

Alternatively, add O on beat3's third 16th where there's an X? Not sure. Maybe better to add O hits in the snare line where there are currently dashes.

Let me try modifying the S line to have O on beat2 and beat4:

For example:

S: ----|O---|--X-|O---
But need to check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe:

S: ----|O-X-|--X-|O---
Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the best approach is to add regular snare hits in the S line where there are currently no hits, and also add toms in T line.

Also, the toms (T) are all dashes, so need to add O or o there. Maybe sync with kick hits or snare.

Let me try constructing step by step.

First, add snare hits. Let's decide where:

Original S has sidestick on beat2 first 16th (X) and beat3 third 16th (X). To add regular snare, perhaps on the 2nd and 4th beats' downbeats. So beat2 first 16th could be O (overriding the X?), but maybe keep X and add another O?

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to replace some X with O. For example, in beat2, instead of X---, have O-X-? That way, a hard hit followed by sidestick?

Alternatively, maybe the snare should be on beat 2 and 4's second 16th. Let's see:

S line after edits:
Beat1: maybe O on the 3rd or 4th? Or leave as ----
Beat2: O on second 16th, so -O--
Beat3: --X- stays, but add O somewhere?
Beat4: O on first 16th?

Alternatively, let's think of a standard backbeat: snare on beats 2 and 4. So in 16th notes:

Beat2's second 16th (the downbeat of beat2 is first 16th, so second 16th is the '&') might be a good place for snare.

Wait, beats are divided into 4 16th notes. Let's map:

Beat 1: positions 1-4 (16th notes)
Beat 2: positions 5-8
Beat 3: 9-12
Beat4:13-16

So snare on beat2 (positions 5-8): maybe position 6 (second 16th of beat2) and beat4 (position 14 (second 16th of beat4)).

So S line would have O on position6 and 14.

So:

Beat2: positions 5-8: -O-- (so second 16th is O)
Beat4: positions13-16: -O-- (second 16th of beat4 is O)

Thus, S line would be:

Beat1: ----
Beat2: -O--
Beat3: --X- (original third beat's third 16th has X)
Beat4: -O--

Wait, but in the original S line, the third beat is "--X-", so third beat's third 16th has X. So putting the S line as:

S: ----|-O--|--X-|-O--

But need to check if that's within the 16th notes. Alternatively, maybe:

Original S line is:

S: ----|X---|--X-|----

Wait, let me recheck the user's input:

The given drum groove is:

@@@
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

Ah, yes. The S line is:

Beat1: ---- (no hits)
Beat2: X--- (X on first 16th)
Beat3: --X- (X on third 16th)
Beat4: ----

So to add regular snare hits, maybe on beat2 and beat4's downbeats (first 16th of each beat). But beat2 already has X there. So perhaps replace X with O? Or add another O elsewhere.

Alternatively, place O on the second 16th of beat2 and fourth beat's second 16th for a backbeat feel.

So:

Beat2's second 16th (position6) would be O, and beat4's second 16th (position14) O.

So S line would be:

Beat1: ----
Beat2: -O-- (so first X is removed and replaced with O? Or keep X and add O?)

Wait, the X is on the first 16th of beat2. If we want to add a regular snare hit on the second 16th, then:

Beat2: -O-- (so first is -, second O, then --. But original had X in first position. So replacing X with O? That would change the sidestick to a regular hit. Maybe that's okay.

Alternatively, keep the X and add an O. But can't have two hits on the same 16th. So perhaps:

Beat2: X-O- (but that's first 16th X, second O? But that might be too much. Alternatively, maybe shift.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants both sidestick and regular snare. Maybe place O on beat2's third 16th, so:

Beat2: X-O- (but that's first X, then O on third?

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to add regular snare hits on beats 2 and 4, replacing some of the sidestick where possible. For example:

In beat2, instead of X---, do O--- (so first 16th is O, replacing X). Then the sidestick could be elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe move the X to another position.

Alternatively, maybe the user just wants to add regular snare hits in addition to the existing sidestick. So adding O in places where there are dashes.

For example:

In beat4's fourth beat, add an O on the first 16th: so beat4 becomes O--- instead of ----.

So S line would be:

S: ----|X---|--X-|O---

That way, there's a regular snare hit on the fourth beat's first 16th (the downbeat of beat4).

Also, beat2 could have an O on the third 16th: so beat2 becomes X-O- (first X, then O on third). But then the third 16th would have O, which is a regular hit.

Alternatively, perhaps:

S: ----|X-O-|--X-|O---

That way, beat2 has X on first, O on third; beat4 has O on first.

This adds regular snare hits while keeping some sidestick.

Now for the toms (T line). Need to add some hits. The T line is all dashes. Maybe sync with the kick or snare.

Looking at the kick (K line):

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
So beat1: o on first 16th
beat2: --o- (third 16th)
beat3: o on first
beat4: --o- (third 16th)

Perhaps add toms on the offbeats. For example, on the second 16th of each beat, or where the kick is not hitting.

Alternatively, following the ride's pattern (R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-), which has a consistent rhythm, maybe place toms on the second 16th of each beat.

So T line could be:

T: -O--|O---|O---|O-- (but need to ensure each beat has four characters.

Let me think step by step for T:

Each beat is four characters. Let's make a pattern like -O-- for each beat, but maybe vary.

Alternatively, toms on the second 16th of each beat:

Beat1: -O-- (second 16th)
beat2: -O--
beat3: -O--
beat4: -O--

So T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--

Alternatively, maybe alternate between O and o for variation. But the user didn't specify, so maybe just add O hits.

Alternatively, sync with the kick. For example, where kick is hitting, add tom on the next 16th.

In beat1, kick hits first 16th (o), so tom on second? -O--

In beat2, kick hits third 16th, so maybe tom on second or fourth.

This is getting a bit complex. Maybe a simple pattern like adding a tom hit on every second 16th note across all beats.

Thus, T line would be:

T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--

So each beat has a tom hit on the second 16th.

Alternatively, maybe vary it a bit. Let's go with that for simplicity.

Putting it all together:

K remains as is.

S line: adding O on beat4 first 16th and maybe beat2 third:

S: ----|X-O-|--X-|O---

T line: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--

Check if that works.

Alternatively, let's see the user's previous examples. In previous edits when adding tom, they often placed tom hits on every beat's second 16th or similar.

Let me proceed with the T line as -O-- for each beat, so:

T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--

Now, check the S line again. The user's edit request is to add not only tom but also snare. The original S line had sidestick, so adding regular snare hits is needed.

Another approach: add a regular snare hit on beat2's second 16th and beat4's second 16th.

Thus, S line would be:

Beat2: -O-- (second 16th O)
Beat4: -O--

So S: ----|-O--|--X-|-O--

This way, the snare has O on beat2 and 4's second 16th, providing a backbeat feel.

Combining all:

Final drum groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|-O--|--X-|-O--
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Wait, but the original S line had in beat3 "--X-", so third beat's third 16th has X. In my S line above, beat3 is "--X-", so that's maintained.

This should satisfy adding snare (O hits) and toms (T line now has hits).

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the snare to have more hits. Let me check if this meets the requirements: "not only tom but also snare". Since the original had sidestick snare, now adding regular snare hits (O) and toms, this should be okay.

I think this works. Let me write the final answer accordingly.
