Okay, let's tackle this edit request. The user wants me to remove any kick or tom parts from the given drum groove. First, I'll need to look at the original groove provided and identify where the kick (K) and tom (T) are playing.

Looking at the K line: "O---|O---|----|O---". That means the kick is hitting hard on the first 16th note of the first, second, and fourth beats. The T line is "O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-", so the toms are playing a pattern across all four beats with a mix of hard and soft hits.

The user's request is straightforward: eliminate both kick and tom. So I'll set all K and T lines to all dashes. Let me double-check each line:

- **K line**: Replace all characters except separators with '-'. So each beat becomes "----", resulting in "----|----|----|----".
- **T line**: Similarly, set all to '----' as well.

Now, check the other instruments to ensure they're unaffected. The S (snare) is only hitting on the third beat's first 16th note and the last beat's first, which should stay. H (hihat) is silent throughout, which is fine. C and R (cymbals/ride) are already inactive. 

Wait, let me confirm that the user didn't mention snare or hihat. The request was only about kick and tom. So yes, leave snare and hihat as they are. 

Final check: Make sure there's no accidental changes to other lines. Yep, all good. The edited groove should have silent kick and tom tracks, with the rest unchanged.
