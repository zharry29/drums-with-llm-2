Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a drum notation example and a specific groove, then asked to remove both the snare (S) and kick (K) parts. 

First, I'll recall the structure: each line represents an instrument, and each character is a 16th note. The user wants to eliminate any hits from the kick and snare, so I need to set all their entries to '-'.

Looking at the given groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I need to change the K and S lines entirely to '-' while keeping H, T, C, R as they are unless they're also to be removed. The request only mentions snare and kick, so hihat (H), toms (T), crash (C), and ride (R) stay. 

Wait, checking the user's request again: "I don't want any snare or kick." So only K and S are removed. The hihat is still present in H line with X and x. The user didn't mention removing hihat, so it stays. Similarly, Toms and cymbals are untouched unless specified. 

So, replacing K and S lines with all '-' characters. Let me count the characters to ensure there are 16 per line. Each segment between | is 4 characters, so 4 segments make 16. 

For K line: original is "O--O|----|--O-|----". Replacing each character with '-': "----|----|----|----".

Same for S line: "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o" becomes "----|----|----|----".

The rest remain the same. Let me double-check each line to ensure no K or S notes are left. 

Final check: H line has X-x patterns, which are closed hihat hits. Since the user didn't ask to remove hihat, that's okay. Toms and others are empty except possibly C or R, but in the given example, they are empty. 

Looks good. The edited groove should have K and S lines all dashes, others as original.
