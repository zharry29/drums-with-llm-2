Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a ride hit and snare in the very beginning. Let me start by understanding the current groove.

Looking at the given groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---  
S: ----|----|O---|----  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

The kick is hitting on the first 16th note of the first beat (O---), then the second beat starts with O--- as well. The snare comes in on the third beat (O---). The toms are playing O-o- on each beat. The ride and crash are currently silent except for the tom hits.

The user wants a ride hit and snare at the very beginning. Since the "very beginning" is the first 16th note of the first beat, I need to add a snare hit there and a ride hit as well. 

First, for the snare (S line), currently, the first beat is "----", so changing the first character to 'O' (hard hit) would add the snare there. 

For the ride (R line), the first beat is "----", so changing the first character to 'O' (hard open hit on the bell) would add the ride hit at the start. 

Wait, but I need to check if that's allowed. The user specified "ride hit and snare in the very beginning," so both on the first 16th note. 

Also, I should ensure that other elements don't conflict. The kick is already hitting on that first note (O---), so having snare and ride there is okay. 

So modifying the S line's first character from '-' to 'O', and the R line's first character from '-' to 'O'. 

Let me verify the notation rules again. 

For the snare (S), 'O' is a hard hit. The user probably wants a standard snare hit there. 

For the ride (R), 'O' is a hard open hit on the bell, which is appropriate for a strong hit at the start. 

Therefore, the edited lines would be:

S: O----|----|O---|---- (Wait, need to check the exact positions. The original S line is "----|----|O---|----". So first beat's first 16th note is the first character. So changing the first character of the first beat (first four characters) from '-' to 'O'. So S becomes "O---|----|O---|----".

Similarly, R line was "----|----|----|----", so changing the first character to 'O' gives "O---|----|----|----".

Let me confirm the rest of the lines remain the same except these changes. The kick remains, toms are okay, no crashes. 

Yes, that should fulfill the request. Let me write the final groove accordingly.
