Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any ride or snare parts. Let me start by looking at the given groove.

First, check the existing instruments. The Kick (K) has some soft hits, the Snare (S) has X and --X, which are sidestick hits. The Hihat (H) has some x's, Toms (T) are silent, Crash (C) is off, and Ride (R) has x and X patterns.

The user's request is to eliminate ride and snare. So I need to set S and R lines to all '-'.

Looking at the Snare line (S: ----|X---|--X-|----), I'll replace all non '-' characters with '-'. That means the second beat's X--- becomes ----, and the third beat's --X- becomes ----. So S becomes all dashes.

For the Ride (R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-), same thing: replace all x and X with '-', making all beats '----|----|----|----'.

The Kick and Hihat can stay as they are since they're not part of the request. Let me double-check the other lines to ensure no snare or ride remains. Toms and Crash are already off. 

Wait, the Crash (C) is also off, so that's fine. The Hihat's x's are allowed since the request only mentions ride and snare. So the final edited groove should have S and R lines blanked out, keeping Kick, Hihat, and Crash as they were. Let me write that out.
