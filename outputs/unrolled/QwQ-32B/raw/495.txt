Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the ride and tom parts. Let me first look at the original groove provided.

Looking at the given drum notation:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

So, the user mentioned they don't want any ride (R) or tom (T). 

First, I'll check the Toms line (T). It's already all dashes, so no action needed there. But the Ride line (R) has some hits. To remove the ride, I need to replace all the characters in the R line with dashes. 

The Hihat (H) has some x's, but the user didn't mention hihat, so leave that as is unless there's a misunderstanding. Wait, the edit request specifically says "no ride or tom", so hihat is okay. But let me double-check the instruction again. The user says "I don't want any ride or tom." So only R and T lines should be cleared. 

Wait, the T line is already empty. So just set R to all dashes. Let me confirm each line:

- K: kick is already empty.
- S: snare is empty.
- H: hihat remains as is since not requested to remove.
- T: toms are already empty.
- C: crashes are empty.
- R: needs to be set to all '-'.

So the edited version should have R's line replaced with all dashes. Let me write that out:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, but the original R line was x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-, so replacing all those with '-' makes sense. The user didn't mention hihat, so leaving H as is. That should be the correct edit.
