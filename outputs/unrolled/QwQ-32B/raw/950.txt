Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the ride cymbal on beat 4, but keep everything else the same. Let me start by understanding the original groove.

Looking at the given drum notation:

**K (Kick):** O---|O---|----|O---
**S (Snare):** ----|----|O---|----
**H (Hihat):** ----|----|----|----
**T (Toms):** O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
**C (Crash):** ----|----|----|----
**R (Ride):** ----|----|----|----

Wait a second, the Ride line (R) is all dashes except maybe in the last beat? Wait no, in the original input, the user provided:

The user's original drum groove is:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, actually in the R line, it's all dashes. So the user is saying "I don't want ride on beat 4", but in the original, there's no ride playing at all. So maybe there's a mistake here. But perhaps I need to check again.

Wait the user's edit request is to remove ride on beat 4. Since the original has no ride in any beat, including beat 4, then the edit is already done. But maybe the user intended there to be a ride on beat 4 that needs removal. Alternatively, maybe there was a typo in the input.

Wait let me check again. The user provided the groove with R as all dashes. So the Ride is not played anywhere. Therefore, the edit request is redundant. But since the user is asking to remove it, perhaps there was an error in the input, but since I have to follow the given input, maybe I should just present the same as original, but confirm.

Alternatively, maybe the user's edit request is a test, but I need to proceed with the given data. Since the original R line has no hits on beat 4 (or anywhere), the edited version should remain the same. However, to be thorough, perhaps the user intended that there was a ride on beat 4 and it's an oversight in the provided groove. But according to the problem statement, I must use the given groove and edit as per instructions.

Therefore, the final answer should leave the R line as all dashes, since there's nothing to remove. But to comply with the instruction, perhaps just restate the same, ensuring that the 4th beat of R is still dashes. So the edited version is identical to the original.
