Okay, let's see what the user is asking here. They want me to edit a drum groove by removing the snare and tom parts. The original groove is given in that specific notation, and the user provided an example of how previous edits were done. 

First, I need to understand the structure. Each line corresponds to a drum part: K is kick, S is snare, H is hihat, T is toms, C is crash, and R is ride. The user's request is to eliminate any snare (S) and tom (T) hits. So, I should go through each line and set S and T to all '-' characters.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, the T line already has all '-' so no change there. The S line has some hits. I need to replace the S line with all '-'.

So the edited version should have S as all dashes. The rest remains the same except S and T. Let me double-check. The user said "no snare or tom", so S and T lines must be silent. The kick, crash, and ride can stay as they are unless they were part of the request. Since the user didn't mention those, leave them. 

Wait, in the original, T is already all '-', so that's already done. The S line needs to be changed from having O's to all '-'. Let me confirm each part:

Original S line:  
S: ----|O---|----|O---

After removing snare, it becomes:  
S: ----|----|----|----

Yes. The rest stays. The crash (C) is still there unless the user also wanted that removed, but the request was only snare and tom. So the final should look like:

K remains the same, S all dashes, T remains, C stays, R stays.

Wait the user's example in previous interactions, like when they removed kick and tom, they just set those lines to dashes. So following that pattern, this should be straightforward.

Let me make sure I didn't miss any other instruments. The user didn't mention hihat, crash, or ride, so they stay as in the original. The edited groove should then have S and T lines cleared where necessary.
