Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to include not only cymbals but also the ride. Looking at the given groove:

The Kick (K) has a busy pattern with O's and --O- etc. The Snare (S) hits on the second and fourth beats. The Toms (T) are silent. The Crash (C) is hitting every beat with O--- repeated. The Ride (R) is completely silent.

The problem is that the current groove uses crashes (C) but no ride (R). The edit request says to add ride in addition to the existing cymbals (crash). 

So I need to add ride hits without removing the crashes. The ride can complement the crashes. Typically, ride is played more continuously, maybe on the bow with X or x. Since the crash is hitting every beat, perhaps the ride can play a steady pattern like quarter notes or eighth notes. 

Looking at the existing Crash pattern: C: O---|O---|O---|O--- (so hard hit on each beat). To add ride, maybe a steady closed hits on the bow. Let's use X for hard closed hits on the ride. Maybe a steady eighth notes pattern like X-x- repeated. That would give a consistent ride rhythm alongside the crashes. 

Check the notation rules for Ride (R): X and x are hard and soft closed hits on the bow. So using X on every 16th note might be too much, but maybe every other. Let me see the original R line was all ----, so adding X-x-|X-x- etc. across all four beats. That would give a steady eighth note pattern on the ride. 

So the edited R line would be X-x- repeated four times. Let me confirm that this doesn't conflict with the crash. Since crashes are on the beats (first 16th of each beat), and ride is on the offbeats, it should work. 

Final check: Ensure that the total characters per line are 16. Each segment is 4 characters separated by |, so four segments make 16. The proposed R line: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x- is correct. 

So the new groove should have the existing crashes and now a ride pattern.
