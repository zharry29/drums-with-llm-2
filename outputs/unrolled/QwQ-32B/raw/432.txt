Okay, so the user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing the kick and ride components. Let me start by understanding the original groove provided. 

Looking at the given drum notation:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The kick (K) has hits on the first and third beats of the bar. The snare (S) is on the second and fourth beats. The hihat (H) is closed hits (X) on every beat, and there's no activity on toms (T), crash (C), or ride (R).

The user's request is to remove any kick or ride. Since the ride (R) line is already all dashes, there's nothing to do there. The main change is to eliminate the kick (K) line. 

So, replacing the K line with all dashes. Let me double-check each part:

- K line becomes "----|----|----|----".
- The snare remains as is because the user didn't mention removing it.
- Hihat stays the same since it's allowed.
- Toms, crash, and ride are already inactive except for hihat.

Wait, does the user want to remove only kick and ride, leaving everything else? Yes. So the edited version should have K and R lines empty. Since R was already empty, just clear K.

Let me write the final version accordingly.
