Okay, so the user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing the ride cymbal on beat 4. Let me start by understanding the given drum notation and the specific request.

First, the original groove is provided in the drum notation format. Each line represents a different drum component: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R). Each line has 16 characters divided into four beats (separated by |), with each character representing a 16th note.

The user's request is to remove the ride on beat 4. That means I need to look at the Ride (R) line and set the fourth beat's characters to '-' (no hit), while keeping everything else the same.

Looking at the original R line:
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Breaking this down into beats:
- Beat 1: x---
- Beat 2: X-x-
- Beat 3: x---
- Beat 4: X-x-

The fourth beat (X-x-) needs to be replaced with ---- since we don't want any ride hits there. The other beats should remain unchanged.

Let me verify the other lines to ensure nothing else is affected. The Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), and Toms (T) lines should stay exactly as they are. The user mentioned "everything else is fine," so I don't need to adjust those.

Putting it all together, the modified R line will be:
R: x---|X-x-|x---|----

Now, I'll reconstruct the entire drum groove with this change. Let me double-check each line to ensure there are no typos or misplaced characters. Especially important to make sure that only the fourth beat of the Ride is altered.

Yes, looks good. The final edited groove should have the Ride's fourth beat cleared, while all other elements remain intact as per the user's request.
