Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any hihat or tom parts. Let me look at the given groove first.

The original groove has:

- **Kick (K):** O--O|----|--O-|----
- **Snare (S):** ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- **Hihat (H):** X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
- **Toms (T):** all dashes
- **Crash (C):** all dashes
- **Ride (R):** all dashes

The user's request is to eliminate hihat and tom. Since Toms are already silent, I just need to silence the Hihat line. Also, check if there's any mention of ride or other elements, but the request specifically mentions hihat and toms. So, set H to all dashes and leave the rest as is except ensuring T remains silent. Let me confirm:

Original H line: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x- â†’ change to ----|----|----|----

Other lines stay the same. The snare is okay since the request is only about hihat and toms. So the edited groove should have H and T lines all dashes. Let me double-check the notation rules to ensure no mistakes. Yep, looks good. So the final version should have H set to all '-' and T remains as it was.
