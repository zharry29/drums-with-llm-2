Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to have not only ride but also tom. Looking at the given groove:

The Kick (K) has hits on the first and third beats. Snare (S) is on the second and fourth beats. Hihats (H) are all X's, which are closed hits. Toms (T) are completely empty. Crash (C) is also empty. Ride (R) is empty too.

The edit request says to include not only ride but also tom. Wait, the original doesn't have either ride or tom. So the user probably wants both added. Let me confirm: "not only ride but also tom" implies both should be added since neither is present.

First, I need to add some tom hits. Toms can have O (hard) or o (soft). Maybe place toms on offbeats to complement the kick and snare. Let's see the structure:

The kick is on beats 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4. Hihats are steady. Let's add toms on the "&" of beats where possible. For example, on the "and" of 1 and 3, or maybe on the 2nd and 4th's "&". Alternatively, syncopated patterns.

Also, add ride. The ride is currently empty. Ride can have X/x (closed on bow) or O/o (bell). Since the hihats are already providing closed hits, maybe use ride on the downbeats or offbeats with closed hits (X) to add texture.

Let me sketch:

For Toms (T):
Maybe on the "and" of beat 2 and 4. Let's try T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O- but spread out. Alternatively, on the third 16th note of each beat? Let me think of a simple pattern. Maybe every other beat's third 16th note: like T: -O--|----|-O--|---- but need to check.

Alternatively, for a 4/4 feel, perhaps T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O- so on the "&" of each beat. Wait, each beat is four 16th notes, so beat 1: 1, 2, 3, 4 (16ths). The "&" is the second 16th. So for T on the "&" of each beat, that would be positions 2 of each beat's 4 notes. So each beat would be --O- but that would be third 16th? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me clarify:

Each beat is divided into four 16th notes. So for each beat, the first 16th is the downbeat (1), then the "and" (2), "a" (3), "a-and" (4). So to hit on the "&" of each beat, that's the second 16th note. So for T, maybe on the second 16th of each beat: like T: -O-- repeated for each beat? So T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O-- but that might be too busy. Alternatively, on beats 2 and 4's "&", so T: ----|--O-|----|--O-.

Alternatively, maybe a tom fill on the third beat? Let's see.

For Ride (R): Since the hihats are already on every 16th note with closed hits, maybe the ride can add some variety. Ride can be on the downbeats (first 16th of each beat) with closed hits (X or x). Since the user might want a balance, perhaps R: X--- repeated for each beat, so R: X---|X---|X---|X---. But that might clash with the kick on 1 and 3. Alternatively, alternate between X and x for dynamics. Or maybe on the "&" as well. Alternatively, use the bell (O or o) on the downbeats for a different tone.

Wait, the user said "not only ride but also tom", so both need to be added. Let's try to make sure both are present.

Let me try:

For Toms (T): Maybe on the third 16th note of each beat (the "a"), so T: --O- repeated. So T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-.

For Ride (R): Let's put X on the first 16th of each beat (downbeats) so R: X--- repeated. That way, ride hits on 1, 2, 3, 4 beats, adding a steady closed hit on the ride bow, while toms add a syncopated hit on the "a" of each beat.

Check if that works with the existing parts. The kick is on 1 and 3, so ride on those downbeats would coincide, which is okay. The snare is on 2 and 4, so ride there as well. That might be a bit busy, but it's a possible direction.

Alternatively, maybe the ride could be on the "&" (second 16th) to avoid clashing with kick and snare on the downbeats. So R: -X-- repeated, so R: -X--|-X--|-X--|-X--. That way, ride hits on the "and" of each beat, providing a different rhythm.

Let me also consider the crash (C). The original has no crash, but the edit request doesn't mention it, so maybe leave it empty unless needed. The user just wants tom and ride added.

Putting it together:

Original K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: (add --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-)
R: (add -X--|-X--|-X--|-X--)

Wait, let's write it out:

Toms (T): --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-
Ride (R): -X--|-X--|-X--|-X--

Alternatively, maybe vary the toms. Let me check the counts again.

Each beat is four 16th notes. So for Toms:

Beat 1: --O- (third 16th)
Beat 2: --O-
Beat3: --O-
Beat4: --O-

That would give tom hits on the third 16th of each beat. That's a consistent pattern.

Ride on the second 16th (the "&") of each beat: -X--

This would create a syncopated feel with toms and ride complementing the kick and snare.

Alternatively, maybe the ride could be on the first 16th (the downbeat) with X, so R: X--- repeated. Then the ride would hit on the same as kick and snare, but that's okay as different instruments.

Alternatively, using the bell for ride (O) on the downbeats. Let's see:

If R uses O on the first 16th of each beat: R: O---|O---|O---|O---

That would give a bell hit on each beat's downbeat, which could add a different texture without clashing too much with kick and snare.

So, choosing between these options. Let's go with the ride on the downbeats (O) for a clear bell sound, and toms on the third 16th of each beat.

Thus:

T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

But check the crash. The user didn't mention crash, but maybe leave it as is unless required. Since the edit is to add ride and tom, that's sufficient.

Wait, the original has no crash, so that's okay.

Final check: the edit request says "not only ride but also tom", so both must be present. The above does that.

Alternatively, maybe add some variation in the toms. For example, on beats 2 and 4's third 16th:

T: ----|--O-|----|--O-

But that might be less consistent. Let's stick with the initial idea for simplicity.

So the final groove would be:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

Alternatively, using X for ride hits on the bow. Since the user might prefer closed hits on ride. Let me check the R's articulation rules:

R: O is bell hard, o soft; X and x are closed bow hits. So using X on the downbeats would be closed bow, which is different from hihat's X (closed hits). That's okay.

Alternatively, maybe alternate between O and X for variety, but simplest is to use X on all ride hits for a steady closed pattern.

Wait, let me re-express the T and R lines properly with the | separators.

Each line has four beats, each beat is four characters. So for Toms:

Each beat: --O- so four beats would be:

T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-

Similarly, Ride with X on second 16th note (beat's second 16th):

Wait, if Ride is on the "&", that's the second 16th. So each beat would be -X--:

R: -X--|-X--|-X--|-X--

So combining:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: -X--|-X--|-X--|-X--

This way, the toms hit on the third 16th of each beat (the "a"), and ride on the second ("&"). That creates a syncopated feel with the kick and snare on downbeats and toms/ride on the offbeats.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants ride on the downbeat. Let me see both options.

Option 1 (ride on "&"):

R: -X-- etc.

Option 2 (ride on downbeat):

R: X--- etc.

Either is valid, but the first avoids clashing with kick and snare on the downbeats. Let's go with that.

Thus, the final edited groove would look like:
