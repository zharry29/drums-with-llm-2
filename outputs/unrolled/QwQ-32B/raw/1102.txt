Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants more low-frequency sounds. From the given notation, the current instruments playing are Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), and Crash (C). The low-frequency instruments are typically the Kick and Toms (T), so I need to emphasize those.

Looking at the original groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

First, the Toms (T) are completely silent. Adding Toms would definitely boost the low end. Let me see where I can place them. The Kick has some hits, but maybe making them harder or adding more. However, the user's request is about more low frequencies, so adding Toms is the key here.

In the first beat (O---), maybe add a Tom hit on the same 16th notes as the Kick. Let's see:

For the Kick line: "O---|---o|O-O-|----", the Toms could mirror some of these. For example, in the first beat where the Kick hits the first 16th note, adding a Tom on the same spot. But since Toms are lower than Kick, maybe overlapping or alternating could work. Alternatively, place Toms on the offbeats where there's space.

Looking at the second beat (---o), the Kick hits the fourth 16th note. Maybe a Tom on the third 16th note here to add a low hit before the Kick.

Third beat (O-O-): Kick hits first and third, so perhaps a Tom on the second and fourth? Or just reinforce with a Tom on the first hit.

Fourth beat (----): No Kick, so maybe add a Tom hit here to fill the space. Also, check the Snare and Crash. The Snare is on beats 2 and 4, and Crash is on the first beat. The Toms should not clash with the Snare's main hits but complement them.

Let me draft possible Tom patterns:

First beat: O--- → Maybe T: O--- to match the Kick's first hit.

Second beat: ---o → Maybe T: --O- to hit the third 16th, leading into the Kick's fourth.

Third beat: O-O- → T: O-O- to mirror the Kick.

Fourth beat: ---- → Maybe T: O--- to add a hit on the first 16th of the fourth beat, even though there's a Snare on beat 4. Alternatively, O--- would be on the downbeat of the fourth beat, which is where the Snare is. Maybe better to have T: -O-- or something that doesn't conflict. Wait, the fourth beat's Snare is on the fourth 16th (since it's the last part of the fourth beat). The fourth beat's first 16th is the start of the fourth beat. So T: O--- here would hit on the first 16th of the fourth beat, which is before the Snare. That's okay.

Putting it all together:

T: O---|--O-|O-O-|O--- 

Wait, let's check each beat:

Beat 1: K: O--- → T: O--- (same as Kick here)
Beat 2: K: ---o → T: --O- (third 16th)
Beat 3: K: O-O- → T: O-O- (same as Kick)
Beat 4: K: ---- → T: O--- (first 16th of the fourth beat)

So T would be:

T: O---|--O-|O-O-|O---

But need to make sure that the Toms are using O (hard hits) to add that low frequency. Also, maybe in the fourth beat, instead of O---, maybe --O- to have a hit on the third 16th, but since there's no Kick there, maybe that's better. Alternatively, maybe a tom on the fourth 16th as well? Let me think again.

Alternatively, to add more low-end, perhaps in the fourth beat, since there's no Kick, place a Tom on the downbeat (first 16th) and maybe another. But the fourth beat's Snare is on the fourth 16th. So T: O--- would be okay.

Another consideration: The original has a Crash on the first beat's first 16th. Adding a Tom there might clash, but since Crash is a cymbal, the Tom can complement it. Alternatively, maybe make the Tom a soft hit (o) there? But the user wants more low, so hard hits (O) are better.

Also, check the Hihat and Snare to ensure Toms don't conflict too much. The Hihat is open and closed hits, but they are higher. The Toms should be lower, so it's okay.

So the T line would be:

T: O---|--O-|O-O-|O---

Wait, let's write each beat separated by |:

First beat (O--- for K): T: O---
Second beat (---o for K): T: --O-
Third beat (O-O- for K): T: O-O-
Fourth beat (---- for K): T: O---

Wait, but the fourth beat's T would be O---, which is first 16th. But maybe the fourth beat's fourth 16th (since the Snare is there), but adding a Tom on the fourth's first 16th is okay.

Alternatively, maybe in the fourth beat, since there's a Snare on the fourth 16th, adding a Tom on the third 16th? So T: --O- for the fourth beat. But let's see:

Alternatively, maybe the fourth beat's T should be O---, so the full T line is:

T: O---|--O-|O-O-|O---

But let me check each beat's characters:

First beat (4 characters): O---
Second: --O-
Third: O-O-
Fourth: O---

Wait, fourth beat is four characters: O--- (so first hit, then three rests). That should be okay.

Alternatively, maybe in the fourth beat, since there's no Kick, add a Tom on the third 16th as well. But let's see the overall pattern.

Another approach: To make the Toms play on every other 16th note, but that might be too busy. Alternatively, mirror the Kick's pattern but with some variation.

Alternatively, in the first beat, since K is O---, maybe T adds an extra hit on the third 16th? Like O-O-, but that might complicate. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe in the first beat, the Tom is O--- (same as K), then in the second beat, --O- (third 16th), third beat O-O- (same as K), and fourth beat O--- (first 16th). That should add consistent low-end hits without clashing too much.

So the T line would be:

T: O---|--O-|O-O-|O---

Now, looking at the Kick line, maybe we can make some of its hits harder (they already are O), but perhaps adding more. However, the user's request is to add low frequencies, so Toms are the main addition here.

Also, the Crash is on the first beat's first 16th. If we remove the Crash (since it's a high sound), replacing it with a Tom or keeping both? The user might prefer to keep the Crash but add Toms. Since the instruction is to add more low, keeping the Crash is okay, but maybe reduce it? Not sure, but the user didn't mention removing anything, so probably leave Crash as is.

So the final edits would be adding the Tom line as above, and maybe reinforcing the Kick where possible. Wait, the original Kick has some o hits (soft), but the user wants more low, so maybe make those harder. Let's check the original K line:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----

First beat: O (hard), then three rests.

Second beat: ---o (soft on the fourth 16th)

Third beat: O-O- (hard, soft, hard?)

Wait, the third beat is O-O-, so first and third 16ths are hard (O), second is rest, fourth is rest. Wait, no: O-O- is four characters. First O, second -, third O, fourth -. So first and third 16ths hit.

So maybe making the second beat's o hit into an O? Since it's a soft hit, making it harder would add more low. So changing ---o to ---O. That could help.

So revised K line:

K: O---|---O|O-O-|----

That would make the second beat's fourth 16th a hard hit, adding more low.

Similarly, the fourth beat is all rests. Maybe add a Kick hit there? But the user might want to keep the structure. Alternatively, leave as is.

So combining these changes:

K: O---|---O|O-O-|----
T: O---|--O-|O-O-|O---

Additionally, check the fourth beat's Tom: O--- would hit on the first 16th, which is the start of the fourth beat, so that's okay.

Also, the third beat's T is O-O-, mirroring the Kick's O-O-.

This should add more low-end with Toms and a harder Kick on the second beat's fourth 16th.

Let me verify the total notation:

K: O---|---O|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: O---|--O-|O-O-|O---
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, this should fulfill the request by adding Tom hits in all beats and making the Kick's second beat's hit harder.
