Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the kick and snare, so I need to set those lines to all dashes. Let me check the original groove first.

Looking at the K line: "O---|---o|O-O-|----". I'll replace all those characters with '-' to eliminate the kick. 

Then the S line: "----|O---|----|O---". Same here, replace everything with '-'.

The Hihat (H) has some patterns like "--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-". Since the user didn't mention hihat, I'll leave that as is unless told otherwise. Wait, the edit request was only about kick and snare, so hihat stays. 

Toms (T) and Crash (C) are also present. The C line has "O---|----|----|----", so the first beat has a crash. Since the user didn't mention crashes, I leave that too. 

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have K and S lines blanked out, others unchanged. Let me double-check each line to ensure no kick or snare remains. Yep, looks good. Final check for any typos in the notation. All set!
