Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a drum notation example and a specific groove, then asked to remove any kick or snare. 

First, I need to recall the instruments each line corresponds to. The given groove has lines for K (kick), S (snare), H (hihat), T (toms), C (crash), and R (ride). The edit request is to eliminate kick and snare, so I need to set their lines to all '-'.

Looking at the original groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user wants to remove kick (K) and snare (S). So, for K and S lines, replace all characters except the separators | with '-'. 

For the K line:
Original: O--O|----|--O-|----
After removal: ----|----|----|----

Similarly for S line:
Original: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
After removal: ----|----|----|----

The other lines (H, T, C, R) stay as they are unless they have their own hits. Checking H has X-x- patterns, which are allowed since the user didn't mention hihat. T, C, R are empty except H. 

Wait, the user's instruction says "I don't want any kick or snare," so only K and S are to be cleared. The rest remain. Let me verify each line:

- K becomes all dashes.
- S becomes all dashes.
- H remains X-x- repeating.
- T, C, R stay as they are (all dashes except H's pattern).

So the final edited groove should have K and S lines empty, others unchanged. Let me write that out:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Double-checking for any remaining K or S hits. Looks good. The user didn't mention other instruments, so leaving hihat as is is correct. That should be the edited version.
