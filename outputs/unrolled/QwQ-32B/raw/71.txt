Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to have not only ride but also hihat. Looking at the given groove:

First, check the current instruments. The Kick (K) is active with O's and -'s. The Snare (S) has O's on the second and fourth beats. The Toms (T) and Hihat (H) are silent. The Crash (C) is hitting every beat with O's, and the Ride (R) is completely silent.

The edit request is to add hihat and ensure there's ride. Since the ride is currently not present, I need to add some ride cymbal hits. Also, since hihat is missing, I should add that as well.

Let me think about typical patterns. Usually, hihat is played on every 16th note for a steady rhythm, often with a closed hit (x or X). The ride could be played on the beats, maybe on the first and third or every beat. Since the crash is already hitting every beat, maybe the ride can complement that without clashing.

Looking at the kick and snare pattern, the kick is OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO. The snare is on the 2nd and 4th beats. To add hihat, I can put closed hits (x) on all 16th notes to keep a steady tempo. That would make the H line: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x- but maybe more consistent. Alternatively, maybe alternating X and x for variation, but the user might prefer simplicity. Let's go with x-x-| repeated for each beat.

For the ride (R), since it's currently empty, I can add hits on the offbeats. For example, on the "and" of each beat. So maybe something like -X-X for each beat. That would give a syncopated ride pattern. Alternatively, hitting on the main beats as well. Let me see the kick and snare. Since the snare is on the main beats, maybe ride on the "&" to create a swing feel. So each beat in R could be -X-X. So the ride would be -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X-.

Wait, but need to check the existing crash. The crash is hitting every beat (O---|O---| etc.), so the ride needs to not conflict. The crash is on the downbeat, so ride on the "and" would be okay. 

Putting it together:

H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x- (closed hihat on every 16th note)

R: -X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X- (ride on the "&" of each beat)

This way, the hihat provides a steady background, and the ride adds a syncopated element without clashing with the crash on the main beats. That should fulfill the request to include both ride and hihat.
