Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a tom hit and cymbal in the very beginning. The original groove has no kick, snare, toms, or crashes, just hihat and ride. 

First, I need to add a tom hit at the start. Since the user mentioned "very beginning," that's the first 16th note of the first beat. The tom line (T) is all dashes now, so I'll put an 'O' there for a hard hit.

Next, the cymbal. The crash (C) and ride (R) are the options. The existing ride has an 'x' on the first note, but the user wants a cymbal, which could be crash. Since crash is on line C, I'll add an 'O' there for a hard crash hit on the first note.

Check the other lines: the kick (K) and snare (S) are empty, so leave them as is unless needed. The hihat (H) is already closed hits, so no conflict. 

Wait, the user didn't mention removing the ride, just adding a tom and cymbal (probably crash). So the ride can stay, but the crash is added at the start. 

So the changes are:
- Toms (T): first note 'O'
- Crash (C): first note 'O'

Original lines:
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

After edits:
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R remains as is unless conflicting, but since the first note of R is 'x', which is a closed hit on the bow, adding a crash on the same beat is okay.

Double-check notation rules: Each line is 16 notes. Adding the O's at the start doesn't affect other parts. 

That should satisfy the request. Let me put it into the notation.
