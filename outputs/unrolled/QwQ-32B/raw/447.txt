Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any cymbals and snare. 

First, I need to recall which lines correspond to each instrument. From the notation guide:

- K: Kick drum
- S: Snare drum
- H: Hihat
- T: Toms
- C: Crash cymbal
- R: Ride cymbal

The user said "no cymbal or snare," so I need to eliminate the S (snare) and both C (crash) and R (ride) lines. 

Looking at the given groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

So, I'll set S, C, and R lines to all '-'.

But wait, the H line is hihat. The user didn't mention hihat, so it stays unless specified. The edit is only about cymbals (C and R) and snare (S). 

So the edited version should have:

- K remains as is unless they also wanted kick removed, but the request didn't say that. Wait the user's exact words: "I don't want any cymbal or snare." So kick is okay.

So the final lines:

K remains unchanged.
S becomes all '-'.
H stays as is.
T stays as is (but in the original T is all '-', so no change).
C becomes all '-'.
R becomes all '-'.

Wait checking the original:

Original S line has X and x, which are sidestick hits on the snare. Since S is snare, those need to be removed. 

Original R line has x and X, which are ride hits. Those must be removed.

C is already empty, so no change there.

So putting it all together:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, in the original R line, the user might have had some notes, so replacing them with '-'.

Yes, that's correct. The final should have S, C, R lines empty, K and H as before, T remains empty as it was.
