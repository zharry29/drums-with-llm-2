Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any hihat or cymbal parts. First, I need to look at the given drum notation and identify which lines correspond to hihat (H) and cymbals (C and R for crash and ride). 

Looking at the provided groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So, the H line (hihat) is already all dashes, meaning it's not being used. The C and R lines (crash and ride) are also all dashes. Wait a second, that means there are no hihat, crash, or ride cymbals in the original groove. The user might have made a mistake, but maybe I should double-check.

The user's request says "no hihat or cymbal," which includes crash (C) and ride (R). Since all those lines are already empty, the groove only has kick (K), snare (S), and toms (T). But the user might still want to ensure those lines are cleared. Let me confirm each line:

- K: Kick is present.
- S: Snare hits on the third and fourth beats.
- H: No hihat.
- T: Toms are active on each beat with O-o- patterns.
- C and R: No crashes or ride.

Since the original already doesn't have hihat, crash, or ride, maybe the user wants to remove the tom (T) as well? Wait, the request specifically says "no hihat or cymbal," so toms are okay. But maybe the user wants to remove the tom part too, but the instruction is clear. Let me stick to the given request.

Therefore, the edited version should keep K, S, and T, but since the user didn't mention toms, they stay. However, looking again, the original T line has content. The user didn't mention toms, so they stay. The only changes needed are to ensure H, C, R are empty, which they already are. Wait, but the user might have thought there were cymbals. Let me check again. The given C and R lines are all dashes. So maybe the user's request is already fulfilled, but perhaps they want to remove the tom as well? The request says "no hihat or cymbal," so toms are allowed. Therefore, the answer should be the same as the original, but perhaps the user wants to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I missed something.

Wait, looking at the original again:

T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

So toms are present. The user didn't mention removing toms, so they stay. The final edit would just ensure that H, C, R are empty, which they are. Therefore, the edited groove is the same as the original. But that seems odd. Maybe the user intended to remove toms too, but since the instruction says only hihat and cymbals, I'll proceed accordingly.
