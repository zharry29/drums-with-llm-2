Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to have no more than 8 notes total. The original groove has several instruments playing, so I need to simplify it.

First, I'll count the current notes. Let's look at each line:

**Kick (K):** "O--O|----|--O-|----"  
Breaking it down per 16th note:
- First beat: O, -, -, O → 2 notes
- Second beat: all dashes → 0
- Third beat: -, -, O, - → 1 note
- Fourth beat: all dashes → 0  
Total for K: 3 notes.

**Snare (S):** "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o"  
- First beat: 0
- Second beat: O, o, -, o → 3 notes (but O and o are different articulations, but they still count as notes)
- Third beat: -, o, -, - → 1 note
- Fourth beat: O, -, -, o → 2 notes  
Total for S: 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 notes? Wait, let's recount:
Second beat: O, o, -, o → 3 notes
Third beat: - o - - → 1
Fourth beat: O - - o → 2
Total S: 3+1+2=6? Wait, original S line: "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o"  
First beat: 4 dashes → 0
Second beat: O, o, -, o → 3
Third beat: -, o, -, - → 1
Fourth beat: O, -, -, o → 2
Total S: 3+1+2 = 6 notes.

**Hihat (H):** All dashes → 0.

**Toms (T):** All dashes → 0.

**Crash (C):** All dashes → 0.

**Ride (R):** "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-"  
Each beat has o, O, -, - → 2 notes per beat. 4 beats → 8 notes total for R.

So total notes: K(3) + S(6) + R(8) = 17 notes. Way over the limit.

Goal: Reduce to ≤8 notes. Need to eliminate most parts.

Prioritize keeping important elements. Typically, Kick and Snare are foundational. Ride might be too busy with 8 notes. Let's see:

Option 1: Keep Kick and Snare minimal, cut Ride.

If we remove Ride entirely (set all to dashes), then K(3) + S(6) = 9 still over.

Need to cut S down. Let's simplify S to only the essential hits. Maybe just the O on the 4th beat's first hit (the last part "O--o" has O on first 16th). Or maybe reduce S to 2 notes.

Alternatively, maybe only keep Kick and Ride, but Ride is 8 notes which is exactly the limit. But user might want more than just Ride. Or maybe combine?

Alternatively, pick two instruments with few notes:

Option: Keep Kick and Ride, but Ride reduced to 4 notes. Let's see:

If we make Ride only hit every other beat, like "o---|o---|o---|o---" → 4 notes. Then K has 3, so total 7. That works.

Alternatively, maybe just Kick and Snare with minimal hits.

Let me try:

**Kick:** Maybe simplify to one hit per bar. Like "O---|----|----|----" → 1 note. But original has more. Alternatively, keep only the first O in K: "O---|----|----|----" → 1 note.

**Snare:** Maybe only the last O in the fourth beat: "----|----|----|O---" → 1 note.

**Ride:** If we set to 6 notes, but need total ≤8. Let's see:

If K=1, S=1, then Ride can be 6 → total 8.

Alternatively, Ride at 4, K=2, S=2 → total 8.

Let me think of a balance. Maybe:

Kick: "O---|----|----|----" → 1 note.

Snare: "----|----|----|O---" → 1 note (the last beat's first 16th).

Ride: "o---|----|o---|----" → 2 notes. But that's only 4 total. Not enough.

Alternatively, maybe keep the Ride at 4 notes and add a couple more in Kick/Snare.

Alternatively, let's see:

Original K had 3 notes. Maybe keep two of them, like first and third beats: "O---|--O-|----|----" → 2 notes.

Snare: maybe just the O in the fourth beat's first 16th: "----|----|----|O---" → 1.

Ride: 5 notes? No, need total ≤8. Let's do Ride as 5 notes? No, better to calculate.

Total desired is ≤8. Let's try:

Kick: 2 notes (like first and third beats)

Snare: 1 note (last beat's first 16th)

Ride: 5 notes → total 8? Wait 2+1+5=8. That's okay, but maybe spread out.

Alternatively:

Kick: 3 notes (original K has 3)

Snare: 0 (remove all)

Ride: 5 → total 8. But maybe better to have some snare.

Alternatively, the user might want the groove to have some drive. Let's try:

Kick: O---|----|O---|---- → 2 notes (first and third beats)

Snare: ----|----|----|O--- → 1 note (last beat)

Ride: o---|----|o---|---- → 2 notes (first and third beats)

Total: 2+1+2=5. Under 8, but maybe add more.

Alternatively, add some hihat? But user didn't mention it's needed. Since the user said "no more than 8," maybe go with exactly 8.

Let me try:

Kick: O--O|----|----|---- → 2 notes (first two 16ths of first beat?)

Wait original K is "O--O|----|--O-|----" → first beat: O--, so first and fourth 16ths? Wait, the first beat of K is "O--O", which is O on first and fourth 16th notes. So that's 2 notes in first beat, but in total earlier count had 3. Maybe better to simplify.

Alternatively, set Kick to "O---|----|----|----" → 1 note.

Snare: "----|----|----|O---" → 1 note.

Ride: "o-O-|----|o-O-|----" → 2 notes per first and third beats → total 4 notes.

Total: 1+1+4=6. Still under.

Alternatively, add a tom hit? But Toms were all dashes. Maybe better to just use Kick, Snare, and Ride.

Let me try another approach. The user's original edit request says "no more than 8 notes". The current R is 8 notes, so if we keep R as is (8), then other instruments must have 0. But that might be too sparse? But the user might accept it. However, the original had S and K as well. Let's see:

If we set all instruments except Ride to dashes, then Ride has 8 notes. That's exactly 8. But maybe the user wants some kick or snare?

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the groove to have a kick and snare with minimal notes plus ride. Let me see:

Kick: O---|----|----|---- → 1

Snare: ----|----|----|O--- → 1

Ride: o---|o---|o---|o--- → 4

Total: 6. Could add two more notes in Ride or another instrument.

Alternatively, Ride at 6 notes, Kick 2, Snare 0 → total 8.

Maybe the best way is to set Ride to 8 (as it is) and turn off everything else. That meets the limit exactly. Let me check:

Original R was "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-". Each beat has two notes (o and O on first and second 16ths?), so 2 per beat *4 =8 notes. So if we leave R as is, and turn off K and S and others, that's exactly 8. But the user might want at least some kick or snare. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to keep some elements. Let me see the original groove again:

Original K: "O--O|----|--O-|----" → 3 notes.

Original S: "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o" → 6 notes.

Original R: "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-" → 8 notes.

Total 17. To get down to 8, perhaps:

Remove S entirely (0), keep K at 3, and R at 5 → total 8. But how?

Alternatively, set R to 5, K to 3 → total 8. Let's try:

K: O--O|----|--O-|---- (3 notes)

R: o---|o---|o---|o--- → 4 notes. Total 7. Add one more in R → 5, total 8.

Alternatively, maybe the user is okay with just the Ride's 8 notes. That's a valid option, but maybe the user expects some kick. Let's see previous examples. In prior edits, when the user said "too empty", I added more, but here it's the opposite. The user now wants minimal.

Perhaps the best is to make Ride exactly 8, and turn off all else. That way, it's exactly 8 notes. Let's check:

Set K, S, H, T, C to all dashes. R remains as "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-". That's 8 notes. So the groove would be:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

But does that meet the requirement? Yes. However, maybe the user wants a kick or snare hit. Let me see if there's a way to have a kick and ride without exceeding 8.

Suppose:

Kick has 1 note: "O---|----|----|----"

Ride has 7 notes → total 8. But 7 notes in Ride would need to be like "o-O-o|o-O-o|--- etc. Maybe not clean.

Alternatively, Kick 2 notes, Ride 6 → total 8. For example:

Kick: O---|----|O---|---- → 2

Ride: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o--- → 2+2+2+1 =7? Not quite.

Alternatively, R: "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o---" → 7, plus Kick 1 → 8.

Alternatively, maybe the user is okay with just the ride. Since the instruction says "no more than 8", exactly 8 is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants a single kick and snare hit plus ride. Let's try:

Kick: O---|----|----|---- (1)

Snare: ----|----|----|O--- (1)

Ride: o-O-|o-O-|o---|o--- → 2+2+1+1 =6. Total 1+1+6=8.

That could work. Let me check:

Kick first beat has O on first 16th.

Snare last beat has O on first 16th.

Ride has two notes in first two beats, and one in third and fourth.

Total notes:

Kick:1, Snare:1, Ride:6 → total 8.

This might be a good balance. Alternatively, maybe the ride can have 4 notes and kick/snare 4.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user just wants the ride's 8 notes. To be safe, I'll go with that since it's exactly 8 and meets the requirement strictly. So the edited groove would have only the ride playing, with all other instruments silent.
