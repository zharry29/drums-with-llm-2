Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a snare hit and a tom in the very beginning. The original groove has nothing on the kick, snare, or toms in the first beat. Let me look at the notation details again to make sure I get the articulations right.

First, the snare (S line) needs a hit at the start. Since they mentioned "snare hit," probably a hard hit, which is 'O'. The tom (T line) also needs a hit at the beginning. For the tom, a hard hit is 'O' as well. 

The first beat is four 16th notes, so the first four characters (before the first |) should have the hits. Let's check the existing lines:

Original K: all dashes, so no kick. The user didn't mention kick, so maybe leave it as is unless needed. But since they specified snare and tom, maybe just add those.

So, for the snare line S: change the first character from '-' to 'O' to make a hard hit on the first 16th note. The rest can stay as they are unless overlapping. 

For the toms T: currently all dashes. Add an 'O' at the first position. 

Wait, need to make sure that adding these doesn't conflict with other instruments. The hihat is closed (x) on the second 16th note of the first beat, but that's okay. The ride and crash are inactive here. 

So the new S line would start with O--- and T starts with O---. Let me double-check the notation rules again. Snare's 'O' is a hard hit, Tom's 'O' is a hard hit. That should work. 

Let me write it out:

K remains as ---- since the user didn't ask for kick. 

S: O---| followed by the rest as original.

T: O---| followed by the rest as original (but original T was all dashes, so first beat is O---).

Other lines stay the same. Let me verify the example given in the problem statement to ensure the format is correct. Yes, each line has 16 characters with | after every 4. So the edited lines should look like:

S: O---|----|----|----
T: O---|----|----|----

Wait, but the original T line was all dashes. So replacing the first four with O--- would be correct. 

Therefore, the final edited groove should have the S and T lines modified as above.
