Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants me to add some hihat to the existing groove. First, I need to understand the current setup. 

Looking at the given groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

So, the Kick (K) has some hits, the Snare (S) is on beats 2 and 4, the Hihat (H) already has some soft and open hits, and there's a Crash (C) on the first beat. The Ride (R) is empty. The user wants more hihat, so I need to enhance that.

The existing Hihat line has some variation: in the first beat, it's "--o-", then "O-o-" in the second, and so on. To add more hihat, I can either make it more consistent or add more hits. Since the current Hihat isn't too busy, maybe adding a steady closed hihat on all 16th notes would give a solid foundation. Alternatively, maybe alternate between closed and open hits for more texture.

But the user just said "add some hihat," so maybe just filling in the gaps where there are none. Let's look at each beat:

First beat (K: O---): H is --o-. So only the 3rd 16th note has a soft open hit. To add, maybe add closed hits on the other notes. Using 'x' for closed hits. So turning "--o-" into "x-x-o" but wait, each beat is four characters. Let me see:

First beat's H is "--o-". To add closed hits on the first three 16th notes, it could be "x-x-o" but that's four characters? Wait, each beat is four characters. The original is "--o-", so first three are '-', then 'o'. To make it steady closed, maybe "x-x-x-o"? No, that's five. Wait, each beat is four 16th notes. So each segment between | is four characters. So first beat's H is four characters: positions 1-4 of the first beat are '-', '-', 'o', '-'. To add closed hits on all except the third, maybe "x-x-o-". But that leaves the last 16th note empty. Alternatively, "x-x-o x" but that's overlapping. Hmm, perhaps better to make it "x-x-o-" but then the last note is still empty. Alternatively, "x-x-x-o" but that's five characters. Wait, no, each beat is exactly four. So for the first beat's H, to add more, maybe "x-x-o-" (so first three 16th notes closed, then the third open, fourth nothing?), but that might not flow well. Alternatively, replace the '-' with 'x' where possible. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, to make the hihat more consistent, perhaps a steady closed hihat on all 16th notes, but with some open hits where they already are. The existing H line has some open hits (O and o), so maybe keep those and fill the rest with closed. For example:

Original H line:
--o- | O-o- | O-o- | O-o-

First beat: "--o-" becomes "x-x-o-" (since first three 16th notes get 'x', then the third is 'o'? Wait, conflicting. Maybe replace the first two '-' with 'x', so "xxo-". But that's three characters. Wait, each beat is four. So first beat's H: positions 1: '-', 2: '-', 3: 'o', 4: '-'. To add closed hits on 1 and 2, it would be "xxo-". Then the fourth 16th note could also be 'x'? Making it "xxox"? But the original had an 'o' on the third. So "xxo x"? Wait, need to keep the 'o' on third. So "x x o -" becomes "x-x-o-", but that's five? No, each beat is four. So first beat's H: first two notes closed (x-x-), then the third is o, fourth '-'. So "x-x-o-" but that's five? Wait, no: first character is first 16th note, second is second, etc. So "x" for first, "x" for second, "o" for third, "-" for fourth. So "x-x-o-" is actually four characters? No, "x-x-o" is five. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me count again. Each beat is four characters. So first beat's H is "--o-". To add closed hits on the first two 16th notes, it would be "xxo-". That's four characters. So replacing the first two '-' with 'x's. So first beat's H becomes "xxo-".

Similarly, the second beat's H is "O-o-". The first note is O (open hit), then '-', 'o', '-'. To add closed hits on the second and fourth? Maybe "Oxox" to make it more active. Or keep the O and add x's where possible. Alternatively, "OxOx" but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants a steady closed hihat with some accents. Since the existing H has some open hits, perhaps keep those and fill the rest with closed. Let's go through each beat:

First beat (H: --o-):
Add closed on the first two 16th notes, so "x x o -" → "x-x-o" but that's five? Wait, no, four. First character x, second x, third o, fourth -. So "xxo-".

Second beat (H: O-o-):
First is O (open), then '-', 'o', '-'. To add closed on the second and fourth? Maybe "OxOx".

Third beat (H: O-o-): same as second, so "OxOx".

Fourth beat (H: O-o-): same → "OxOx".

But let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe keep the existing open hits and add closed where there are '-', so:

First beat: "--o-" → "x x o x" (assuming adding closed on first, second, and fourth). But original has '-' on first, second, and fourth. So replacing those with 'x' gives "xxxo" but the third is 'o', so "xxo x"? Wait, maybe "x-x-o x" but that's five. Hmm, maybe better to just put 'x' on all '-' positions. Let's try:

First beat: "--o-" becomes "x x o x" (since first, second, and fourth are '-', replacing with x). So "x x o x" → "x-x-Ox"? Wait, no, third is 'o'. So "x-x-o x" → but that's five. Wait, four characters:

First character: x

Second: x

Third: o

Fourth: x → so "xxox".

Second beat's H: "O-o-"

First: O, second: '-', third: o, fourth: '-'

Replace the second and fourth '-' with x → "OxOx".

Third and fourth beats similarly.

So the new H line would be:

xxox | OxOx | OxOx | OxOx

But need to check the notation rules. Hihat's articulation: X and x are closed hits (hard and soft). Since we're adding closed hits, using lowercase x (soft) might be better for a more consistent feel, unless the user wants harder hits. Since the original has some 'o's (soft open), maybe using x (soft closed) is appropriate.

Putting it all together, the edited H line would be:

H: xxox|OxOx|OxOx|OxOx

Wait, but in the original second beat's H: "O-o-", so the first is O (hard open), then '-', 'o' (soft open), '-'. Replacing the second and fourth with x (soft closed):

So second beat becomes O x o x → "OxOx".

Similarly for third and fourth.

So the final H line would be:

H: xxox|OxOx|OxOx|OxOx

But let me check each beat:

First beat: "xxox" → x x o x (so closed, closed, open, closed)

Second: "OxOx" → O (open), x (closed), o (soft open), x (closed)

Third same as second.

Fourth same.

This adds more hihat activity while keeping the existing open hits. Alternatively, maybe the user prefers a busier hihat with more closed hits. Alternatively, maybe a steady closed hihat on all 16th notes, but that might conflict with existing open hits.

Alternatively, another approach: since the user said "add some hihat", perhaps just doubling the existing pattern but adding more. Alternatively, in the first beat, where there's an o on the third 16th, maybe add closed on the others. 

Alternatively, maybe the existing H line has some open hits, so adding closed hits on the offbeats. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the current Hihat has some open hits, but the user wants more, so perhaps making it a constant closed hihat with the existing open hits as accents. For example, replacing all '-' with 'x' (soft closed), so:

Original first beat: "--o-" → "x x o x"

Second beat: "O-o-" → "O x o x"

Third and fourth similarly.

Yes, that seems logical. So the H line would be:

H: x-x-o-x | O-x-o-x | O-x-o-x | O-x-o-x but formatted as four characters per beat.

Wait, each beat is four characters, so:

First beat: "x x o x" → "x-x-x" but that's four: "xxox" (as before).

Second beat: "O x o x" → "OxOx".

So the final H line would be:

H: xxox|OxOx|OxOx|OxOx

I think that's a solid approach. Let me check if that's within the notation rules. The H line uses 'x' for soft closed hits, which is allowed. The existing 'O' and 'o' are kept as open hits, so that's okay.

So the edited groove would have this H line, and leave the rest as is. Let me verify the other lines to ensure no mistakes. The K, S, T, C, R lines remain the same except H is modified as above.

Yes, that should fulfill the request to add more hihat.
