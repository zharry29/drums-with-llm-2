Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants an open hihat on the last 8th note. First, I need to recall how the notation works. Each line represents an instrument, and each character is a 16th note. The bar is divided into four beats, each with four 16th notes. The last 8th note would be the third and fourth 16th notes of the last beat. Wait, actually, an 8th note is two 16th notes. So the last 8th note of the bar would be the third and fourth 16th notes of the fourth beat.

Looking at the given groove:

H: line is all dashes except for the last beat. The user wants an open hit there. The Hihat's open hit is denoted by 'O' or 'o'. Since the request is for an open hit, probably a hard open hit 'O' on the last 8th note. 

The original H line is "----|----|----|----", so the last beat is "----". The last 8th note spans the third and fourth 16th notes. To make the last 8th note open, I need to replace the last two dashes with 'OO'. So the last beat's H line becomes "--OO". Wait, let me check:

Breaking down the last beat (fourth one): the original is "----". The 16th notes are positions 1,2,3,4. The last 8th note is positions 3 and 4. So replacing those two with 'O's would make it "--OO".

So the H line would be "----|----|----|--OO".

Wait, but let me confirm the structure again. Each beat is four characters. The last beat's H line is "----", so changing the last two to 'O's gives "--OO".

Yes, that should do it. Let me make sure there's no other instrument conflicting. The other lines like S, T, C, R don't have anything on those positions, so it's safe. The kick and snare in the last beat are |--o- for K and O--o for S, but the Hihat's change is separate. So the final H line should end with --OO.
