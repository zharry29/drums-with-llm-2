Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any ride or kick elements. 

First, I'll look at the given groove. The K (Kick) line has some hits like O--O and --O-. Since the user doesn't want kick, I'll replace all K's entries with dashes.

Next, the R (Ride cymbal) line is already all dashes, so no change there. But wait, maybe I should double-check. The original R line is empty, so that's good.

The S (Snare) and H (Hihat) parts are okay as they are since they're not related to ride or kick. The T (Toms) are also fine unless they were part of the ride, but toms are separate. 

Wait, the user specified "ride or kick", so only K and R lines need adjustment. Let me confirm each line:

- K: Replace all with ----|----|----|----
- S remains as is.
- H remains as is.
- T remains as is (since no toms were requested to be removed).
- C (Crash) is already empty.
- R is already empty.

So the final groove should have the K and R lines all dashes, others unchanged. Let me write that out.
