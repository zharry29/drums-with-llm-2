Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. Let me start by understanding the problem. The user provided a drum notation example and explained each instrument's lines. The current groove has Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R) parts. The edit request is to remove any ride or hihat.

First, I'll look at the given drum groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

The user wants to eliminate the ride (R) and hihat (H). That means I need to set all H and R lines to all dashes. Let's check each line:

- **Hihat (H)**: Currently has x-x- repeating in each beat. To remove hihat, replace all characters in H's line with '-'.
- **Ride (R)**: Already has all dashes. Since the user mentioned removing ride, even if it's already empty, confirming it's clear is good.

Other instruments (K, S, T, C) can stay unless they conflict, but the request only mentions ride and hihat. Let me verify each line:

- **Kick (K)**: Has some O and - patterns. Keep as is.
- **Snare (S)**: Third beat has S---, others are empty. Keep.
- **Toms (T)**: Third beat has ---O, others empty. Keep.
- **Crash (C)**: All O--- in each beat. Keep unless instructed otherwise.

Now, modifying H and R:

For H line: Change "x-x-" in each beat to "----".

Original H line: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
Modified H line: ----|----|----|----

R line is already all dashes, so no change needed.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should look like this:

K remains:
-K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-

S remains:
-S: ----|----|S---|----

H becomes all dashes:
-H: ----|----|----|----

T remains:
-T: ----|----|---O|----

C remains:
-C: O---|O---|O---|O---

R stays as is (all dashes):
-R: ----|----|----|----

Double-checking to ensure no other instruments were mentioned to remove. The user only wanted ride and hihat gone, so this should be correct.
