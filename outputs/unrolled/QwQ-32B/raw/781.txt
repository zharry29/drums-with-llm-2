Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a ride hit and cymbal in the very beginning. The original groove has no kick, snare, or crash in the first beat, only hihat and ride. 

First, the "very beginning" refers to the first 16th note of the bar. The existing ride starts on the first note with an 'x', which is a closed hit on the bow. To add a cymbal (probably crash) and a ride hit at the start, I need to place a 'O' on the crash line and maybe a 'O' on the ride for a harder hit. 

Looking at the crash (C) line, it's all dashes. So adding an 'O' on the first 16th note would introduce a crash there. For the ride (R), changing the first 'x' to an 'O' would make it a harder open hit on the bell, fulfilling the "ride hit" part. 

Wait, the user mentioned both a ride hit and cymbal. Since crash is a cymbal, that's covered. The ride is another cymbal, but maybe they want both? But the request says "ride hit and cymbal," which might mean a crash and ride together. So adding the crash 'O' on C and keeping the ride's 'x' or changing to 'O' as a stronger hit. 

I'll go with adding 'O' on crash at the first note and changing the ride's first 'x' to 'O' for a stronger hit. Let me check the notation rules again. Crash uses 'O' for hard, so that's correct. Ride's 'O' is a hard open on the bell. That should work. Let me make sure other lines stay the same except for the first note of each line. 

Wait, the kick and snare are all dashes in the first beat, so no changes there. The hihat's first beat has dashes except the second 16th note. The user didn't mention changing hihat, so leave it. 

Final adjustments: 

C line starts with 'O---', and R line starts with 'O---' instead of 'x---'. That should add a crash and a strong ride hit at the beginning.
