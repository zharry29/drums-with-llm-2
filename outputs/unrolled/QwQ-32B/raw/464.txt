Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a drum notation example and explained each part. The task is to remove any hihat (H) and snare (S) from the given groove.

First, I'll look at the original groove they provided:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user wants no hihat or snare. Let's check each line:

- **K (Kick)**: Has hits, so leave as is.
- **S (Snare)**: The user said to remove it. So replace all characters with '-'.
- **H (Hihat)**: Already all '-', but maybe double-check. Since the user wants it gone, ensure it's all '-'.
- **T (Toms)**: Has patterns, keep them.
- **C (Crash)**: Empty, so no change.
- **R (Ride)**: Also empty.

Wait, the original S line has some hits in the last beat: "----|O---". Need to clear all S entries. The H line is already clear. So the edited version should have S and H lines all '-'.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should look like this:

K remains the same. S becomes all '-'. H stays as '-'. Toms stay. Crash and ride remain.

Double-checking the structure: Each line has 16 characters (4 beats of 4 notes each). Let me count for each line after changes:

- K: "O---|O---|----|O---" → 16 chars (correct)
- S: "----|----|----|----" → 16 chars
- H: Same as S → 16
- T: "O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-" → 16
- C and R are okay.

Looks good. No mistakes here. The user’s request is fulfilled by zeroing out S and H lines.
