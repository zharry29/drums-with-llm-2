Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any ride or hihat parts. First, I need to look at the original groove provided.

Looking at the given drum notation:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

The user's request is to eliminate the ride (R) and hihat (H). 

Starting with the Hihat line (H), it's already all dashes, so no changes needed there. But wait, checking again: H is all dashes, so maybe that part is already okay. 

Now, the Ride (R) line has "o-O-" repeated in each beat. To remove the ride, I need to set all those to dashes. 

So, the edited version should have R line as all dashes. Let me double-check each line:

Kick (K) and Snare (S) remain as they are since the request only mentions removing ride and hihat. Toms (T) and Crash (C) are already inactive. 

Wait, the original H line is already empty, so no action needed there. The main change is the R line. 

So the final edited groove should look like this:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I need to make sure that all characters in the R line are replaced with '-', keeping the structure with the | separators every four characters. Each line has 16 characters, so replacing each 'o-O-' segment with '----' four times. Let me confirm the counts:

Original R line: "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-" becomes "----|----|----|----".

Yes, that should do it. No other instruments are affected by the request, so they stay the same.
