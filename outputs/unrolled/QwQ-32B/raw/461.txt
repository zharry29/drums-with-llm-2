Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the hihat and snare. First, I'll look at the original groove provided.

Looking at the K (Kick) line: It has O's and -'s, so that's okay to keep. The S (Snare) line has some O's in the second and fourth beats. Since the user doesn't want snare, I need to replace those with dashes. 

The H (Hihat) line is all dashes except maybe in some parts, but the user specified no hihat, so I'll set all H line entries to dashes. The T (Toms) are empty, so they stay. The C (Crash) has O's in every beat. The user didn't mention crashes, so I leave them unless told otherwise. Wait, the edit request was only about hihat and snare, so crashes are okay. But wait, the user might want to keep crashes? Let me check the request again. The user says "I don't want any hihat or snare." So only those two instruments are to be removed. 

Wait, in the original groove, the S line has entries in the second and fourth beats. So replacing those with dashes. The H line is already all dashes except maybe not? Wait, looking at the given groove:

Original S line: "----|O---|----|O---" so in beats 2 and 4, there are O's. So changing those to dashes. The H line is all dashes, so no change there. Wait, the user might have hihat in other parts? Let me check again. The H line in the given is: "----|----|----|----", so no hihat. So maybe the user is just being cautious, but in this case, H is already silent. 

So the main changes are: set S to all dashes and ensure H is dashes. The other lines (K, T, C, R) can stay as they are unless they have snare or hihat, which they don't. Wait, the R (Ride) line is all dashes here, so no problem. 

Wait, the C line has crashes. Since the user didn't mention crashes, they should remain. So the final groove should have K, T, C, and R as in original, but S and H set to all dashes. Let me reconstruct that.

Original K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
Original S: ----|O---|----|O---  
After edit S: ----|----|----|----  
H remains all dashes.  
T and C stay the same.  
R is already dashes.  

So the final should look like:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|----|----|----  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, that should be correct. Just removing the snare hits and ensuring hihat is silent.
