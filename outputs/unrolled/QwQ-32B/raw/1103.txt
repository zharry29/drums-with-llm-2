Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a drum groove and wants it to have more low-frequency sounds. First, I need to understand what's in the original groove and where I can add or modify elements to achieve that.

Looking at the given drum notation:

**Kick (K):** o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
This has soft hits on the first and third beats of each measure, but they're pretty sparse. To add more low-end, increasing the kick's presence makes sense. Maybe adding harder hits (O instead of o) and possibly more notes.

**Snare (S):** ----|X---|--X-|----  
The snare uses X and x, which are sidestick hits. Sidestick is a softer, more muted sound, which isn't very low. Replacing these with regular snare hits (O or o) on the snare head could add more body. Since the user wants more low frequencies, maybe using harder hits here or moving to the snare body.

**Hihat (H):** ----|x---|----|x---  
The hihat is closed hits (x) on the second and fourth beats. Hihats are high-pitched, so reducing their prominence or replacing them with toms could help. But since the user didn't mention removing hihats, maybe just keeping them but adding lower elements elsewhere.

**Toms (T):** All dashes. Toms are low to mid-range, so adding hits here would definitely boost low frequencies. Need to decide where to place them. Maybe aligning with the kick or snare for a tighter groove.

**Cymbals (C and R):** Both are inactive. Adding crashes or ride might not contribute to low frequencies, so probably leave them as is unless needed.

**Original groove analysis:**
The current low-end comes only from the kick with soft hits. To increase low frequencies, I can:

1. **Strengthen the Kick:** Replace soft 'o' with hard 'O' and add more kick hits.
2. **Add Toms:** Since toms are low, adding tom hits on offbeats or in sync with the kick could help.
3. **Modify Snare:** Replace sidestick with regular snare hits (O) to add mid-low frequencies.

Let me look at each line:

**Kick (K):** Currently has 'o' on the first 16th note of the first beat, then a rest, then 'o' again. Maybe make those 'O' and add more hits. For example, in each beat (4 16th notes), maybe have a kick on the first and third 16th notes (like O-O-) to create a busier kick pattern.

**Snare (S):** The X and x are sidestick. Let's switch to O on the 2nd and 4th beats (since snare is typically on 2 and 4 in 4/4). So in the second beat, instead of X---, maybe O---, and similarly adjust others.

**Toms (T):** Since they're empty, maybe add O on the offbeats. For example, between kick hits. Let's see where the kick is. If the kick is on 1 and 3, toms could be on 2 and 4, or syncopated.

Putting this together:

**Kick:** Let's make all kicks hard (O) and maybe double-time some parts. Original has o--- on first beat. Changing to O---. The second beat has --o- (so third 16th note). Maybe make it O--- instead for a consistent hit on the first 16th. Wait, need to check original's structure.

Wait, original K line is: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
Breaking it down per beat (each | is a beat, 4 16th notes per beat):

Beat 1: o---
Beat 2: --o-
Beat 3: o---
Beat 4: --o-

So first beat has a kick on the first 16th, second beat has a kick on the third 16th, third beat first 16th, fourth beat third 16th. That's a syncopated kick pattern.

To add more kick, maybe add another hit in each beat. For example, in beat 1: O-O- (hits on 1 and 3), beat 2: O--- (hit on 1?), but need to maintain the original's feel but beef it up.

Alternatively, make all the existing o's into O's and add an extra kick in each beat. For instance:

K: O-O-|O-O-|O-O-|O-O-  
But that might be too much. Alternatively, keep the original pattern but with O instead of o and add a tom on the offbeats.

Alternatively, let's make the kick hits harder (O) and add a tom on the offbeats where the hihat is. The hihat is on the second and fourth beats' first 16th (x--- and x---). So maybe toms on those positions?

Wait, H is on second beat's first 16th (x---) and fourth beat's first 16th (x---). So maybe tom hits there. Let me see:

Original H line:  
Beat 2: x---  
Beat 4: x---  
So on beats 2 and 4, first 16th note is hihat. Maybe replace those with toms (O) to add low frequencies. But the hihat is closed (x), which is a higher sound. Replacing with tom would take that away. Alternatively, keep hihat and add toms on other parts.

Alternatively, add toms on the offbeats. For example, between kick hits. Let's see:

Original kick hits are on:

Beat 1: 1st 16th  
Beat 2: 3rd 16th  
Beat 3: 1st 16th  
Beat 4: 3rd 16th  

So between those, maybe add toms on 2nd and 4th 16ths of those beats? Let's try:

For beat 1: O (first 16th), then tom on second? But need to see the overall.

Alternatively, let's think of the snare first. The snare is currently on beat 2 (X---) and beat 3 (--X-). Changing those to O on the 2nd and 4th beats. Let's adjust S line:

Original S:  
Beat 2: X--- (so first 16th?) Wait, the second beat's snare is X---, which would be hit on the first 16th of beat 2? That might not be standard. Typically, snare is on 2 and 4, but maybe this is a fill. Hmm, perhaps the user's original has snare on the second beat's first 16th (so 1/16th note after beat 1), but maybe that's part of the groove.

Alternatively, to make it more standard, move snare hits to the 2nd and 4th beats. Let me see:

Original S line breakdown:

Beat 1: ---- (no hit)  
Beat 2: X--- (first 16th of beat 2)  
Beat 3: --X- (third 16th of beat 3)  
Beat 4: ---- (no hit)  

This seems like a syncopated snare pattern. To add more low, maybe make those hits harder (O instead of X/x) and perhaps add a tom on the 2nd and 4th beats.

Alternatively, adding toms on the snare hits. Let's try:

For the snare hits (beat 2 first 16th and beat 3 third 16th), instead of X, use O on snare, and also add a tom hit there? But that might be too much. Alternatively, replace sidestick with regular snare.

So changing S line to have O on those positions:

S: ----|O---|--O-|----

Wait, original second beat is X--- (beat 2 first 16th), so changing to O--- would have a snare hit there. Third beat's --X- becomes --O- (third 16th). So:

S: ----|O---|--O-|----

That would make the snare hit on beat 2 first 16th and beat 3 third 16th, which is still syncopated but with harder hits, adding more low/mid.

Then, for toms, maybe add hits on the offbeats. For example, between kick hits. Let's see where the kick is:

K:  
Beat 1: O (first 16th), then rest, so adding a tom on the third 16th? Or second?

Alternatively, in each beat, place a tom on the second and fourth 16ths where there's no kick. Let's try:

T line: for each beat, maybe O on the second and fourth 16ths?

So per beat:

Beat 1: O--- (kick on first 16th), so tom on second and fourth? Let's try:

T: -O-O|... but need to see.

Alternatively, let's look at each beat:

Beat 1:  
K: O--- (kick on 1)  
H: ----  
So maybe tom on 2 and 4? So T: -O-O  

But that might be too much. Alternatively, just on the second 16th.

Alternatively, let's map it out beat by beat.

First beat:

K: O--- (positions 1, -, -, -)  
H: ----  
T: Let's add a tom on the 2nd and 4th 16ths: -O-O  
So T: -O-O for beat 1.

Second beat:

K: --O- (kick on third 16th)  
H: x--- (hihat on first 16th)  
T: Maybe add a tom on the second and fourth 16ths: -O-O  

Third beat:

K: O--- (kick on first 16th)  
T: -O-O again.

Fourth beat:

K: --O- (kick on third 16th)  
H: x--- (hihat on first 16th)  
T: -O-O  

Putting this together, the T line would be:

T: -O-O|-O-O|-O-O|-O-O  

But that's four beats, each with -O-O, so each beat's T line is -O-O.

Wait, each beat is four characters. So for four beats:

T: -O-O|-O-O|-O-O|-O-O  

Which would be: -O-O for each beat, so the full line would be "-O-O|-O-O|-O-O|-O-O".

This adds toms on the second and fourth 16ths of every beat, providing a consistent low end. That should help with the low frequencies.

Now, checking the snare changes:

Original S was:  
Beat 2: X--- (first 16th)  
Beat 3: --X- (third 16th)  
Changing to O--- and --O- would make those hits harder, contributing more low/mid.

Additionally, the kick is already using 'o' which can be changed to 'O' for harder hits. Let's do that first:

Original K line: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
Changing all 'o's to 'O's:

K: O---|--O-|O---|--O-  

Wait, original second beat was "--o-", so changing the 'o' to 'O', so "--O-".

So K becomes:

O---|--O-|O---|--O-  

That makes the kick hits harder.

Now putting it all together:

**K:** O---|--O-|O---|--O-  
**S:** ----|O---|--O-|----  
**H:** ----|x---|----|x--- (unchanged, since we're focusing on low)  
**T:** -O-O|-O-O|-O-O|-O-O  
**C:** ----|----|----|----  
**R:** ----|----|----|----  

Wait, but let me check if that makes sense rhythmically. The kick is still on the same positions but harder, and toms fill in the gaps with their own pattern. The snare hits are now harder.

Alternatively, maybe the toms can be on the same timing as the hihat? Since hihat is on the first 16th of beats 2 and 4, adding toms there. Let's see:

For beats 2 and 4, first 16th has hihat. Adding a tom there would mean replacing hihat? Or adding both? Since hihat is closed (x), maybe keeping it but adding a tom underneath. But in the notation, each instrument is separate, so they can both hit at the same time.

So for beat 2 first 16th: hihat x and tom O. So T's first character of beat 2 would be O, making that position O-x? Wait, no. Each character is per instrument. So hihat's first character in beat 2 is x, and tom's first character can be O. So they can both play at the same time. That's allowed.

Therefore, in beat 2 first 16th, both hihat (x) and tom (O) hit. That would add more low end there.

Alternatively, maybe the toms can be placed on the offbeats where there's no kick. Let me think again.

Alternatively, toms on the 2nd and 4th 16ths of each beat, as before, would create a steady low-frequency pulse. That might be effective.

Testing this setup:

Kick has harder hits, snare is harder, and toms are consistently hitting the 2nd and 4th 16ths. This should significantly boost the low frequencies without overcomplicating the groove.

Another consideration: The original had ride (R) with x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-. But the user's edit request was to focus on low frequencies, so maybe turning off ride and crash to reduce high-end, but the user didn't mention that. Since the original R line was active, but in the problem statement's given groove, R is active. Wait, in the user's provided groove:

Wait, looking back at the user's given groove:

@@@
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

Ah, the ride (R) is active with some pattern. To reduce high frequencies, maybe turning off ride, but the user only asked for more low frequencies, not necessarily to reduce high. However, adding more low might naturally balance it. But since the user didn't specify removing highs, perhaps leave R as is unless necessary.

Alternatively, if the user wants more low, maybe reduce the ride's activity? But the instruction says "more low frequency sounds" not "less high". So perhaps leave R alone unless adding toms covers it.

Proceeding with the previous plan.

Finalizing the edited groove:

Kick: O---|--O-|O---|--O-  
Snare: ----|O---|--O-|----  
Toms: -O-O|-O-O|-O-O|-O-O  
Hihat remains same, Ride same, Crash same (but in original, C was all dashes, so no change there).

Wait, let me reconstruct each line:

**K:**  
Original: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
After changing o to O and same positions:  
O---|--O-|O---|--O-  

**S:**  
Original: ----|X---|--X-|----  
Changing X to O (since X is sidestick, O is regular hit):  
----|O---|--O-|----

**H:** Unchanged: ----|x---|----|x---  

**T:** Adding toms on 2nd and 4th 16ths of each beat:  
Each beat is four 16ths, so for each beat:  
Beat 1: -O-O (positions 2 and 4)  
Thus, T line becomes: -O-O|-O-O|-O-O|-O-O  

**C and R:** Stay as original (C is all dashes, R has its pattern).

Putting it all into the notation:

K: O---|--O-|O---|--O-  
S: ----|O---|--O-|----  
H: ----|x---|----|x---  
T: -O-O|-O-O|-O-O|-O-O  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-  

Wait, but the user's original R line was x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-, so we can leave that as is unless instructed otherwise.

However, the user's edit request is to add more low, so this should suffice.

Let me double-check for any inconsistencies or overdoing it. The kick is now harder, snare hits are stronger, and toms are adding a consistent low pulse. This should meet the requirement.
