Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to have not only cymbal but also kick. Wait, but looking at the given groove:

The Kick (K) line is already active with "OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO", so it's already present. The Cymbal (C) is also there with "O---|O---|O---|O---". So the request might be a bit confusing. Maybe they meant adding more cymbals or ensuring both are present? Let me double-check the original request.

The user says "The groove should have not only cymbal but also kick." Hmm, but the kick is already there. Perhaps it's a mistranslation or misinterpretation. Maybe they meant "not only hihat but also cymbal and kick"? Wait, looking at the original groove's Hihat (H) line: it's all dashes. Oh! The hihat isn't present. The user might have intended that the groove should include both hihat and cymbal along with kick. The original edit request might have a typo, saying "cymbal" instead of "hihat". Let me check previous interactions for context.

Looking back at prior examples, users often request adding hihat when it's missing. In this case, the current groove lacks hihat (H line is all ----). The cymbal (C) is present. So maybe the user wants hihat added in addition to existing kick and cymbal. The request might have a wording mix-up. So the correct action is to add hihat patterns to the H line while keeping the existing kick and cymbal.

So the plan is: keep K and C as they are, add hihat (H) with some closed or open hits. Let's choose a common hihat pattern, like steady closed hits (X or x on every 16th note). Let's pick X for a harder closed hit. So H line would be X-X- repeated across the bar. Let's structure that properly with the | separators. Each beat is 4 characters, so four beats would be "X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-". Wait, but need to check the original H line's length. The original H was all dashes, so replacing with X every note. That should work. Alternatively, maybe alternate between X and - for a lighter feel. Let me confirm the notation rules again.

The Hihat (H) uses O (hard open), o (soft open), X (hard closed), x (soft closed). To add a steady closed hihat, using X every 16th note would be appropriate. So each beat is "X-X-" (since 4 notes per beat, but with | separators). Wait, each beat is four characters, so "XXXX" per beat? Wait, the example given in the notation has H: x---|x---|x---|x---, which is one hit per beat on the first 16th note. Maybe a common pattern is alternating X-x- for a swing feel, but to keep it simple, perhaps a steady closed hihat on every 16th note. Let me go with X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X- for the H line. That would make it X every other 16th note, which is standard for a steady eighth-note feel. Wait, actually, each | separates beats, and each beat has four 16th notes. So "X-X-" would be X on the first and third 16th of each beat. To have every 16th hit, it would be "XXXX" per beat. Let me confirm:

Original example's H line in the notation was x---|x---|x---|x--- which is x on the first 16th of each beat. To have every 16th note, the H line should be "X-X-" for each beat? Wait, no, "X-X-" would be first and third, leaving the second and fourth as -. To have all four, it's "XXXX". But maybe that's too busy. Alternatively, maybe a pattern like X-x- to create a swung feel. Let me pick a common hihat pattern. Since the kick and cymbals are already active, a steady closed hihat on every 16th note (XXXX|XXXX|XXXX|XXXX) might be too much. Alternatively, every eighth note (two 16ths): so X-X-| repeated. Let's go with X-X- for each beat. That gives a steady eighth note pattern. So:

H: X-X-|X-X-|X-X-|X-X-

But let me check the total characters. Each line must have 16 characters (4 beats * 4 notes). "X-X-" repeated four times would be 16 characters (4 characters per beat * 4 beats). Yes. So that's valid. 

Therefore, the edited groove will have the existing K and C lines, and add the H line with X-X- patterns. That should fulfill the request of adding hihat (assuming the original request had a typo and meant hihat instead of cymbal). Let me present that in the final answer.
