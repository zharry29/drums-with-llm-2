Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any ride or snare parts from the given groove. 

First, I'll look at the original groove provided:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

The user's request is to eliminate the ride (R) and snare (S) elements. 

Starting with the Snare (S line): It's already all dashes, so no changes needed there. Wait, actually looking again, the S line is all dashes, meaning there's no snare in the original. Hmm, maybe the user is concerned about possible hidden snare hits, but according to the input, S is inactive. But since the instruction says "I don't want any ride or snare," perhaps there's a mistake here. However, proceeding as per the given data.

Next, the Ride (R line) has some hits: "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-". To remove ride, we need to replace all those characters with '-'.

So, the edited R line should be all dashes.

Additionally, checking other instruments to ensure nothing else needs adjustment. The Hihat (H) has some activity, but since the request is only about ride and snare, those can stay.

So the final groove should have:

- K: unchanged (all dashes)
- S: already all dashes
- H: unchanged
- T and C: also unchanged as they're inactive
- R: all dashes

Let me verify again. The original R line has "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-", which are closed and open hits on the ride. Removing them by setting to '-'.

Final check: Ensure that only R is modified (to all '-') and S is already clear. That should meet the user's request.
