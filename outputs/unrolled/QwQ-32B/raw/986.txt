Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to "fill up the whole bar with double kick." First, I need to understand what that means. Double kick usually refers to playing two kicks per beat, which would mean hitting the kick drum on both the 8th and 16th notes. Since each beat is divided into four 16th notes, "filling up the whole bar" likely means having a kick hit on every 16th note, creating a continuous double bass pattern.

Looking at the original groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

The kick line has hits on some 16th notes but not all. To fill the bar with double kick, I need to replace the existing kick pattern with continuous OoOo or similar, ensuring every 16th note has a kick hit. However, the user might want a strict double stroke (hard and soft alternation?), so using "OoOo" for each beat would make sense.

But I need to check if other elements should stay. The user said "everything else is fine," so S, H, T, C, R remain. But in the original, there's a snare on the third beat (S---), toms on the third beat (---O), and crashes on every beat. Those should stay as per the instruction.

So replacing the K line with four beats of "OoOo" each. Let's see:

Original K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
New K: OoOo|OoOo|OoOo|OoOo

That fills every 16th note with alternating hard and soft kicks. The other lines stay the same. Let me confirm:

- S remains with S on third beat.
- H's closed hi-hats stay.
- T's tom on third beat and crash on fourth.
- Crashes every beat.

Yes, that should meet the request. I'll format it properly between the @@@.
