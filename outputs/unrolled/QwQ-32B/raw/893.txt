Okay, I need to tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants no more than 8 notes in the entire groove. Let me first look at the original groove to see how many notes there are.

Starting with the Kick (K line): "-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-". Let's count each note. Each character represents a 16th note. Breaking it down beat by beat:

First beat: "-O--" has 1 note (the O).
Second beat: "OO--" has 2 notes (the two O's).
Third beat: "---O" has 1 note (the O at the end).
Fourth beat: "-OO-" has 2 notes (the two O's).
Total for K: 1+2+1+2 = 6 notes.

Snare (S line): "----|----|S---|----". The S is in the third beat's first note. Wait, the S is written as a single note. Let me check. Each beat is four characters. The third beat is "S---", so that's 1 note. The rest are dashes. So S has 1 note.

Hihat (H line): "x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-". Each beat has two x's. Each x is a note. So per beat: 2 notes. Four beats: 2*4 = 8 notes. But the user wants total notes ≤8. Currently, H has 8, which is already the limit. But combined with others, it's over. Let's see:

Total so far: K (6) + S (1) + H (8) + T (0) + C (4, since each O in the Crash line is a note) + R (0). Wait, Crash (C line): "O---|O---|O---|O---" each beat starts with O. Each beat has 1 O, so 4 notes. So total notes are 6+1+8+0+4+0 = 19 notes. Way over.

The user wants to reduce to ≤8. So need to eliminate most of these. Let's see:

First, Crash has 4 notes. Maybe remove all of them? That brings down by 4 to 15. Hihat has 8, which is already the total allowed. But even without Crash, it's 15. So need to cut more.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants each instrument to have notes but total across all instruments is ≤8. Let me check the instruction again: "no more than 8 notes in the entire groove". So total across all instruments must be ≤8.

Original total was 19. Need to get down to 8 or fewer.

Let me see which instruments can be reduced. The Hihat is contributing 8 notes already. If we remove Hihat entirely, that takes it down to 11 (6+1+0+4=11). Still over. Then need to cut further.

Let me see the Kick has 6, Snare 1, Crash 4. Total 11. So need to reduce by 3 more. Let's see:

If we remove the Crash (4 notes), then total is 6 (K) +1 (S) =7. That's under 8. But maybe the user wants some Crash. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to keep some elements but minimal.

Alternatively, let's consider each line:

Kick: 6 notes. Maybe reduce that. Let's see:

Original K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
If I make it only hit on the first note of each beat, maybe? Let's try:

K: O---|O---|O---|O---. That would be 4 notes. But maybe even fewer.

Alternatively, maybe just two hits. Let's see.

Snare has 1 note. Maybe keep that.

Hihat currently has 8. Let's remove all Hihat (set to all dashes). Then:

Kick: 6, Snare:1, Crash:4 → total 11. Still need to cut 3 more.

If I reduce the Kick to 4 notes (like O--- on each beat), that would be 4. Then total would be 4+1+4=9, still over.

Alternatively, remove the Crash (4 notes) and reduce Kick to 4: 4+1=5. That's good.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to keep the Crash but minimal. Let's see:

If we keep one Crash hit, say on the first beat. So C: O---|----|----|---- → 1 note.

Then total would be K (6) + S (1) + C (1) = 8. That's exactly 8.

But let's check:

K: original has 6. Maybe keep the Kick as is? Let me count again:

Original K has 6, S has 1, C has 4. Total 11. If we reduce C to 1, that's 6+1+1=8. So that's possible.

So steps:

1. Remove all Hihat notes (set to all dashes).
2. Reduce Crash to 1 note (first beat only).
3. Keep Kick and Snare as they are, which would total 6+1+1=8.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to have the Kick reduced as well? Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants only the Kick and Snare with minimal notes. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the Kick to have only the first note of each bar? Let's see.

Original Kick: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO- → 6 notes.

If we make it O---|----|----|---- → 1 note. Then total would be 1 (K) +1 (S) +1 (C) =3, but maybe that's too sparse. The user might want some groove.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to keep some elements. Let me think of another approach.

Another way: To have exactly 8 notes. Let's distribute them.

Suppose:

Kick: 4 notes (one per beat)
Snare: 1 note (as original)
Crash: 3 notes (maybe on beats 1,2,4)
Total: 4+1+3=8. That works.

But need to adjust accordingly.

Alternatively, let me look for the minimal changes. The user might prefer to keep the structure as much as possible but cut down.

Original K has 6, which is a lot. Let me see:

Original K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO- → positions:

Beat 1: 2nd sixteenth (O)
Beat 2: first and second (OO)
Beat 3: fourth (O)
Beat4: second and third (OO)
Total 6.

If I reduce K to only the first note of each beat:

K: O---|O---|O---|O--- → 4 notes. Then total notes would be 4 (K) +1 (S) +4 (C)=9. Still over by 1. So remove one Crash.

Alternatively, set Crash to 3, then total is 4+1+3=8.

Alternatively, maybe remove the third and fourth Crash hits, so C: O---|O---|----|---- → 2 notes. Then total 4+1+2=7.

Alternatively, let's go back to the initial idea where removing Hihat (8 notes) and keeping K:6, S:1, C:1. That's 8 total.

So:

Set H to all dashes: H: ----|----|----|----

Crash to only first beat: C: O---|----|----|----

Snare remains: S: ----|----|S---|----

Kick remains as original: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO- (6 notes)

Total: 6+1+1=8. That's exactly 8. So that works.

Alternatively, maybe the user prefers to have the Crash on every other beat, but only 2 notes. Let me see. Let's see if there's any other instruments contributing. Toms and Ride are silent in original, so they can stay.

So the edited version would be:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, but in this case, the S is only one note (third beat first 16th), so total notes:

K:6, S:1, C:1 → total 8.

Yes, that works. So that's the way. Alternatively, maybe the S note can be moved or adjusted, but the user didn't specify, so keeping it as original is okay.

So the final answer should be this.
