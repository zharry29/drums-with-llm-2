Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a ride hit and cymbal in the very beginning. The original groove is:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

First, the "very beginning" refers to the first 16th note of the first beat. The user mentioned both a ride hit and a cymbal. The ride (R) and crash (C) are separate instruments. 

Looking at the Ride line (R), it's all dashes. To add a ride hit at the start, I should put an articulation there. The notation for ride includes O (hard bell), o (soft bell), X/x (closed bow). Since it's the beginning, maybe a standard hit like 'O' on the bell.

For the cymbal, that's the Crash (C) line. Adding an 'O' there as well for a hard hit.

So, first character of R and C lines should be 'O'. Let me check the existing lines:

Original first beat for R: ---- so changing the first '-' to 'O' gives O---.

Same for Crash (C): changing first '-' to 'O' gives O---.

Now check for conflicts. The Kick has an 'O' on the first note. Adding Ride and Crash hits there is okay, as multiple instruments can hit the same note. 

The user didn't mention changing anything else, so the rest stays the same. Let me verify the lines again:

K remains O---|O---|----|O---
S stays ----|----|O---|----
H remains empty
T stays with toms
C becomes O---|....
R becomes O---|....

Yes, that should do it. Make sure not to add anything else unless necessary. The edit is only for the first note of the first beat on Ride and Crash.
