Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove the kick and ride cymbal parts from the given groove. 

First, I'll look at the original drum notation provided:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

The user's request is to eliminate any kick (K) and ride (R) parts. 

Starting with the Kick (K line): The current pattern has O--O in the first beat, then some rests, and so on. To remove the kick, I'll replace all characters in the K line with dashes (-), effectively silencing the kick drum.

Next, the Ride (R line): The ride has a pattern of o-O- repeated across the bar. Removing the ride means replacing all those characters with dashes as well.

Now, check the other instruments to ensure they stay as they are unless instructed otherwise. The Snare (S) has some hits, Hihat (H) is silent, Toms (T) are silent, and Crash (C) is also silent. Since the user didn't mention those, they stay unchanged.

So, modifying the K and R lines to all dashes:

K: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Double-checking that no other instruments are affected. The edited groove should now have no kick or ride, keeping the snare and any other parts intact. That should fulfill the user's request.
