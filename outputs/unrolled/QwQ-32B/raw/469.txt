Okay, I need to edit the given drum groove based on the user's request to remove the snare and kick. Let me start by understanding the original groove.

Looking at the provided drum notation:

K: O---|----|O---|---- (Kick drum has hits on the first 16th note of the first and third beats)
S: ----|O---|----|O--- (Snare hits on the second and fourth beats)
H: X---|X---|X---|X--- (Hihat has closed hits on every beat)
T: ----|----|----|---- (No tom hits)
C: ----|----|----|---- (No crash)
R: ----|----|----|---- (No ride)

The user wants to remove the snare (S) and kick (K). So I'll set all their entries to '-'.

After removing K and S, the remaining instruments are Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R). The user didn't mention these, so they stay as they are unless there's an implicit instruction. Since the user only specified removing snare and kick, the other parts remain. 

Wait, the original Hihat has X--- on each beat. Since the user didn't mention hihat, it stays. The user might just want to eliminate the kick and snare, leaving other elements untouched. 

So the edited groove should have K and S lines all '-', and the rest as original. Let me double-check:

Original H line: X--- repeated four times. Keep that. T, C, R are empty except maybe others? In the given example, T, C, R are all empty except H. 

So the final edited version should be:

K: all dashes
S: all dashes
H remains the same
T, C, R remain as they were (which is all dashes except H)

So putting it all together:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Yes, that should be correct. I need to make sure there are 16 characters in each line, counting the | separators. Each segment between | is 4 characters, so four segments make 16. The user's original H line is correct, so no changes there. The other lines for K and S are now empty except the separators.
