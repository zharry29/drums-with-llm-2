Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to have not only snare but also ride. Looking at the given groove, I see the snare (S line) has some hits, like the 'S---' in the third beat and 'O--o' in others. The ride (R line) is all dashes, so that's where the change needs to happen.

First, I need to add ride hits without conflicting with existing parts. The kick (K) and crash (C) are already active, so I'll focus on the R line. The hihat (H) has a steady pattern, so maybe syncopate the ride to add some interest.

I'll start by adding ride hits on the offbeats. Since the snare is on certain beats, placing ride hits in between could work. Using 'X' and 'x' for closed hits on the bow might blend well. Maybe a steady eighth-note pattern with some variation. Let me try '-X-X' for each beat to create a consistent rhythm. That should complement the snare and kick without overpowering. Let me check the original structure again to ensure it fits. Yep, adding '-X-X' across all beats in the ride line should do it. That way, the ride is present throughout, fulfilling the edit request.
