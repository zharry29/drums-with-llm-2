Alright, let's tackle this edit request. The user wants a cymbal hit and ride in the very beginning of the given drum groove. 

First, I need to understand the current groove. Looking at the provided notation:

**Kick (K):** O---|---o|O-O-|----  
**Snare (S):** ----|O---|----|O---  
**Hihat (H):** --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-  
**Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----  
**Crash (C):** O---|----|----|----  
**Ride (R):** ----|----|----|----

The user wants to add a cymbal (probably crash) and ride hit at the very start, which is the first 16th note of the bar. 

Starting with the **Crash (C)** line: The first segment is "O---", meaning there's already a crash hit on the first 16th note. But maybe the user wants an additional ride hit there? Or perhaps they want both crash and ride? The request says "cymbal hit and ride," so maybe they want both.

Looking at the **Ride (R)** line: It's all dashes in the first beat. To add a ride hit at the beginning, I should place an 'O' (hard hit on the bell) on the first 16th note. 

Wait, the crash already has an O there. Since the user mentioned both cymbal and ride, maybe that's okay. The crash is a cymbal, and adding a ride hit would complement it. Let me check if having both on the same note is acceptable. In drumming, playing both crash and ride simultaneously is possible but might depend on the desired sound. Since the user specified both, I'll proceed.

So, modifying the first character of the Ride line to 'O', making it **O---|...**

Let me verify the notation rules again to ensure correctness. The Ride's O is a hard open hit on the bell. That fits. The Crash's O is also a hard hit. So the first 16th note will have both Crash and Ride hits. 

Double-checking the user's request: "cymbal hit and ride in the very beginning." Since crash is a cymbal, this should meet the requirement. 

No other changes are needed since the rest of the groove seems okay. Let me write the final version accordingly.
