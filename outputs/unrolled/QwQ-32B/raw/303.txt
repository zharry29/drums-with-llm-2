Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user provided a drum pattern and wants it to include both ride and snare. Looking at the original groove:

First, check each instrument line. The Kick (K) has some hits, Snare (S) is already present with O and O---, so snare is there. Hihat (H) has some open and closed hits. Toms (T) and Crash (C) are inactive except for the crash on the first beat. The problem is the Ride (R) is completely silent.

The edit request says "not only ride but also snare," but since snare is already present, maybe they meant to ensure both are present? Or perhaps they want to add ride while keeping the snare. Since the user's previous examples added ride where it was missing, I'll proceed by adding ride.

The current R line is all dashes. To add ride, I need to choose articulations. The ride can use X and x for closed hits on the bow, which are common for a steady rhythm. Let's go with a consistent pattern like -X-X repeating every beat to create a steady 16th-note ride pattern. That should complement the existing snare and kick without clashing. Also, check that the snare remains as is. The crash (C) is already there but maybe leave it unless instructed otherwise. The final R line would be "-X-X|-X-X|-X-X|-X-X" to cover all four beats. Let me confirm that this doesn't interfere with other instruments. The snare hits on the 2nd and 4th beats are on the O (hard hit), so the ride's X on those beats might add a nice contrast. Looks good. So the edited groove adds the ride pattern while keeping the existing snare intact.
