Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any tom or ride elements from the given drum groove. First, I need to recall which lines correspond to Toms (T) and Ride cymbal (R). 

Looking at the original groove provided:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait a second, the Toms line (T) is already all dashes, so there's no tom playing here. The user might have mentioned "tom" just in case, but maybe they also wanted to ensure that the Ride (R) is removed. Since the R line is already empty, maybe the main issue is the Crash cymbal (C) which has some hits. But the user specifically said "tom or ride," so Crash is a different cymbal. 

Wait, the edit request is to remove "tom or ride," so I should check both. The Toms (T) are already inactive, so no changes needed there. The Ride (R) is also inactive. However, there's a Crash cymbal (C) with some hits. But the user didn't mention crash, only tom or ride. So maybe the Crash is okay to stay? Wait, the user's instruction might be to remove any cymbals, but the request specifically says "tom or ride." 

Hmm, perhaps I should only remove the Ride (R) and Tom (T) parts. Since T is already empty, and R is empty too. But the Crash (C) has O--- in the first beat. Since the user didn't mention crash, maybe it's okay. Wait, but maybe "cymbal" includes crash and ride. The user might have meant to exclude all cymbals, but the exact request was "tom or ride." 

Wait the user's exact words: "I don't want any tom or ride." So only those two instruments. The crash is a different cymbal, so it's allowed to stay unless specified. But maybe the user considers "cymbal" as a category, but the instruction was specific to tom and ride. 

So in this case, the original groove's T and R lines are already clear. The only potential issue is the Crash (C) line. But since the user didn't mention crash, I shouldn't touch that. Wait, but let me double-check the original groove again. 

Original C line: C: O---|----|----|----

So the first beat has a hard crash hit. Since the user didn't mention crash, perhaps they want to keep it? But maybe they meant all cymbals, including crash? The instruction says "tom or ride," so perhaps the crash is okay. 

Therefore, the edit required here is already satisfied because T and R are inactive. But maybe the user intended to remove all cymbals (crash and ride). Let me check previous interactions. 

Looking at the user's history, in similar requests like "I don't want any snare or cymbal," they meant removing those instruments. Here, "tom or ride" would mean remove those two. Since T and R are already clear, perhaps the answer is to leave it as is. However, the user might have intended to remove all cymbals (including crash). 

Wait, the user's exact instruction here is "I don't want any tom or ride." So only those two. Since the given groove's T and R lines are already all dashes, the edited version should be the same as the original. But maybe I should confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the original. Let me check again:

Original T line: T: ----|----|----|---- (no toms)
Original R line: R: ----|----|----|---- (no ride)

Therefore, the edit is already done. But maybe the user's example in previous edits had other elements. Wait, perhaps I should just proceed to output the same groove but with T and R lines cleared, but they already are. So the final answer is the same as the input. But maybe the user expects to also remove crash? Let me think again. 

The user's instruction is explicit: remove tom or ride. So the crash is allowed. Therefore, the correct edit is to leave the T and R as they are (already empty), so the groove remains unchanged except perhaps formatting? Or maybe I missed something. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to ensure that even if there were toms or ride, they are removed. Since they aren't present, the output is the same. So I'll present the same drum groove but ensuring that T and R are empty. 

Therefore, the final answer should be the same as the input, except for possibly the crash, but since the user didn't ask for that, it stays.
