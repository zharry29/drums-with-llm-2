Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user provided a drum groove and wants me to edit it so that it includes not only tom but also snare. Wait, the original groove already has snare, right? Let me check the given groove again.

Looking at the S line (Snare drum) in the given groove: @@@
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@ 

Oh, the snare is already present. The S line has O--- on the second beat and the fourth beat. So maybe the user meant that the groove should have both tom and snare? Because currently, the Toms (T line) are all dashes, meaning no tom hits. The edit request says "not only tom but also snare," but since the snare is already there, perhaps the user wants to add tom parts in addition to the existing snare. That makes sense. So the task is to add tom hits to the groove while keeping the snare as is.

Alright, so I need to add some tom hits (using O or o since T's articulation is hard and soft hits) in the T line where it's currently empty. Let me think about where to place them. The existing kick and snare pattern is straightforward. The kick is on the first and third beats, and the snare is on the second and fourth. The hihats are closed hits (X) on every 16th note. 

To add toms, maybe syncopate them or place them on offbeats. Let me see the structure. Each bar has four beats, each with four 16th notes. Let's look at each beat:

First beat: K: O--- so kick on first 16th, S: ---- so no snare here. Hihats are X---, so closed hit on first 16th. 

Second beat: K: ----, S: O--- (snare on first 16th of this beat). Hihats X--- again. 

Third beat: K: O---, S: ----, H: X---

Fourth beat: K: ----, S: O---, H: X---

So the snare is on beats 2 and 4, first 16th of each. 

Adding toms could complement the kick and snare. Maybe on the offbeats. Let's consider adding tom hits on the "&" of the beats. For example, in the first beat, after the kick, maybe a tom on the second 16th (the "&"). Let's see:

First beat: T: -O-- (so tom hit on the second 16th)
Second beat: maybe a tom on the third or fourth 16th. Since the snare is on the first, maybe the third? Like T: --O- for the second beat.
Third beat: similar to first, T: -O--
Fourth beat: similar to second, T: --O-

Alternatively, maybe a pattern like T: --O- on each beat. Wait, but need to make sure it's spread across the bar. Alternatively, maybe a consistent pattern. Let me think of a simple tom pattern. Since the kick is on 1 and 3, maybe the tom on the "and" of 2 and 4. 

Alternatively, let's make the tom play on every other 16th note but offset from kick and snare. Let me try:

T line could be something like:

First beat: -O-- (so second 16th)
Second beat: --O- (third 16th)
Third beat: -O--
Fourth beat: --O-

That would give T: -O--|--O-|-O--|--O-

Alternatively, maybe a repeating pattern every beat. For example, each beat has a tom on the second and fourth 16ths: T: -O-O on each beat. But let's see:

If T: -O-O| -O-O| -O-O| -O-O, but that might clash with the kick on first and third. Alternatively, maybe -O-- on each beat, so every beat's second 16th. Let me check:

T: -O--|--O-|--O-|--O- (no, need to check each beat)

Wait, each beat is four characters separated by |. So for four beats, each with four characters. Let's write it out:

T: -O-- | -O-- | -O-- | -O-- 

That would be tom on the second 16th of each beat. That might work. Let me see how it sounds with the existing kick and snare.

Alternatively, maybe alternate between O and o for dynamics. Since the user didn't specify, just adding hard hits (O) is okay. 

Alternatively, maybe place toms on the third 16th of each beat: T: --O- on each beat. 

Alternatively, to add some variation, maybe on the first and third beats, the tom is on the second 16th, and on the second and fourth on the third 16th. 

Alternatively, to make it more interesting, maybe a pattern like O--- on the first beat, then ---O on the second, etc., but that might not flow well. 

Alternatively, since the kick is on 1 and 3, and snare on 2 and 4, maybe the toms can fill in the "&" of each beat. So each beat's "&" (second 16th) has a tom. That would be T: -O-- on each beat. Let's see:

So the T line would be:

T: -O-- | -O-- | -O-- | -O--

But that's the same every beat. Maybe vary it a bit. Alternatively, every other beat. Like first beat -O--, second beat ----, third -O--, fourth ----. But that might be too sparse. 

Alternatively, maybe on beats 1 and 3, the tom is on the second 16th, and on beats 2 and 4, on the third. 

So:

First beat: -O--

Second beat: --O-

Third beat: -O--

Fourth beat: --O-

Thus, T: -O-- | --O- | -O-- | --O-

That way, the toms alternate between the second and third 16ths of each beat. 

Alternatively, maybe a steady eighth notes with toms on the "&" of each beat. 

Alternatively, let's see the existing kick and snare. The kick is on the first 16th of beats 1 and 3. The snare is on the first 16th of beats 2 and 4. Hihats are closed on every 16th. Adding toms on the "&" of each beat (second 16th) would add some groove. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants toms to be more prominent. Let me pick a pattern. Let's go with T: -O-- on each beat, so every beat's second 16th. That way, the tom hits on the "&" of each beat. 

So the T line would be:

T: -O-- | -O-- | -O-- | -O--

But need to make sure that's 16 characters. Let's count:

Each part between | is four characters. So four beats, each with four characters: total 16. 

Yes. So the T line becomes "-O--| -O--| -O--| -O--".

Alternatively, maybe use O and o for variation. But since the user didn't specify, just O is okay. 

Wait, the original T line was all dashes. So adding that pattern would fulfill the requirement of adding tom. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants toms in different places. Let me check the original groove again. 

Original S line has snare on beats 2 and 4 first 16th. The kick is on 1 and 3 first 16th. The toms are empty. 

So adding toms on the offbeats (the "&" of each beat) would create a more full sound. 

Therefore, I'll set the T line to have O on the second 16th of each beat. 

Thus, the edited groove would be:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
But wait, the user's edit request was "not only tom but also snare." But since the snare is already present, maybe they wanted to add both? But the original already has snare. Maybe the user made a typo and meant "not only snare but also tom". In that case, adding tom is correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the groove should have both tom and snare, implying that maybe the original had only snare and tom was missing. Since the original T line is all dashes, adding toms is the right move. 

Therefore, the final answer should include the T line with the tom hits added as described. Let me confirm the characters:

Each beat is four characters. So for T line:

First beat: -O-- (characters 1-4: -, O, -, -)
Second beat: -O-- (5-8)
Third beat: -O-- (9-12)
Fourth beat: -O-- (13-16)

Yes, that's correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants more variation. Let me see if there's a better pattern. For instance, maybe on beats 1 and 3, the tom is on the third 16th, and beats 2 and 4 on the second? Not sure. But the simplest way is to have consistent placement. 

Alternatively, maybe adding a tom on the fourth 16th of each beat. Like T: --O- for each beat. 

Alternatively, combining both second and fourth 16ths. But perhaps starting with a simple pattern is better. 

I think the first approach is okay. Let me proceed with that.
