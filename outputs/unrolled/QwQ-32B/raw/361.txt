Okay, the user wants me to edit their drum groove by removing any cymbal or ride parts. Let me look at the given groove first.

The original groove has:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

So the user mentioned removing cymbals and ride. The cymbals here are Crash (C) and Ride (R). Looking at the lines, the C line is all dashes, so no crash cymbal is used. But the R line has o-O- patterns in each beat, meaning the ride is being played. 

The edit request says to remove both cymbal (which includes crash and ride) and ride specifically. Since the ride is under R, I need to clear that line. Also, check if there are any crash hits. Since C is already empty, no need to change that. 

Snare (S) and Kick (K) are okay as they aren't mentioned to be removed. Hihat (H) and Toms (T) are also not part of the removal request. 

So the edited version should have the R line set to all dashes. Let me double-check each line:

- K remains the same.
- S stays as is.
- H is already empty, so no change.
- T is empty, stays.
- C is already empty.
- R needs to be cleared.

Final check: Ensure only the R line is modified to all dashes. Yep, that should do it.
