Okay, let's see. The user wants a hihat hit and tom in the very beginning of the drum groove provided. First, I need to understand the existing groove and where to make the changes.

Looking at the original drum groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The kick (K) starts with an "O" on the first 16th note of the first beat. The snare (S) has hits on the second beat's first 16th note and the fourth beat's first. The hihat (H) is closed hits (X) on every 16th note. Toms (T), crash (C), and ride (R) are all silent except for the kick and snare.

The request is to add a hihat hit and a tom hit at the very beginning. The "very beginning" would be the first 16th note of the first beat. 

For the hihat: The existing hihat is already playing X (closed hit) on every 16th note, including the first one. Wait, but the user wants an additional hihat hit? Or maybe they want to ensure it's there? Hmm, maybe they want to emphasize it, but since it's already there, perhaps they want a different articulation? Wait, the current H line is X--- for the first beat. So the first note is already an X. But maybe the user just wants to confirm that it's present, so maybe no change needed there. Alternatively, maybe they want an open hit? But the request says "hihat hit", which could be either. Since the existing is X (closed), maybe that's okay. Wait, but the user might not realize it's already there. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to add a tom hit in the first 16th note, along with the existing kick and hihat. Since the tom line (T) is all dashes, so adding an O (hard hit) on the first note would introduce the tom.

So the steps are:

1. Check the first 16th note of the first beat for hihat: already has X, so that's good.
2. Add a tom hit on the first 16th note. So change T's first character from '-' to 'O'.

Therefore, the edited groove would have T: O---|... etc., and the rest remains the same except T's first note.

Wait, but the user's request is "a hihat hit and tom in the very beginning." Since the hihat is already there, maybe that's okay, and the main change is adding the tom. So the final answer should reflect that.
