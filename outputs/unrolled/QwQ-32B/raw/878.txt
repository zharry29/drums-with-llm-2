Okay, so the user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing the snare hits on the downbeats of beats 2 and 4. Let me start by understanding the current groove.

Looking at the provided drum notation:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

First, let's break down each line. The Kick (K) has no hits. The Snare (S) also has no hits, which is interesting because the user's request is about avoiding snares on beats 2 and 4, but they aren't present here. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me check again.

Wait, the Snare line is all dashes except maybe in some other parts. Let me confirm. The Snare line here is all dashes except maybe in the third beat? Wait no:

S: ----|----|----|----

So the snare isn't playing at all in this groove. But the user says to avoid snare on downbeats 2 and 4. Hmm, maybe there was a previous version where the snare was on those beats, but in this given groove, it's not. So perhaps the user wants to add snare hits but not on those downbeats? Or maybe there's a mistake in the input.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to ensure that even if there are snare hits, they don't land on those downbeats. Since in this case the snare isn't present, maybe the user wants to add some snare but avoid those positions. Let me see the edit request again: "Let's avoid having the Snare on the downbeat of 2 and 4." Since there's no snare here, perhaps the user wants to add some snare hits but not on those beats. But the instruction is to edit the given groove. Since the given groove has no snare, maybe the user wants to add some snare but not on those downbeats. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have snare hits but in the current version, they are on those beats, but in the given data, they aren't. Maybe there's a mistake in the input provided.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed as if the snare is present on those downbeats. Let me check again. The Snare line here is all dashes. So maybe the user wants to introduce some snare hits but not on beats 2 and 4. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe there was a typo, and the user provided an incorrect example. Since the current groove has no snare hits, perhaps the user wants to add some. Let me assume that the user wants to add snare hits but not on the downbeats of 2 and 4. Let's see the Ride (R) has some hits, and the Hihat (H) is closed on beats 2 and 4. Maybe the user wants to add snare on the offbeats instead.

Alternatively, maybe the original groove had snare hits on those downbeats, but in the current input, it's not there. Since the user's instruction is to avoid them, perhaps the user wants to ensure that even if there are snare hits, they are not on those positions. Since there are none, maybe the user just wants to keep it as is, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the input, and the user intended to have snare on those beats. Since I can't ask for clarification, I'll proceed by adding snare hits but avoiding the downbeats 2 and 4.

Let me consider where to place the snare. The groove has a hihat closed on beats 2 and 4 (the H line has x--- for each beat, so first note is closed hit on the downbeat). The Ride has a pattern that starts with an x on the first 16th note, then X on the second, etc. Maybe adding snares on the "and" of the beats or the upbeats.

For example, in beat 1: maybe the snare on the second 16th note (the 'and') or third. Let's say adding a soft open hit (o) on the "&" of beat 1 and 3. Let me try:

S: ----|----|----|---- becomes adding, say, on the "&" of beat 3 and 4? Wait, need to avoid downbeats 2 and 4. Let's think of each beat's 16th notes as 1 e & a.

So beat 2's downbeat is the first 16th note of the second beat. Similarly, beat 4's downbeat is the first 16th note of the fourth beat. So to avoid those, we can place snare on the other 16th notes.

Maybe adding snare on the "&" of beat 1, the "a" of beat 1, then on beat 3's "&", etc. Let me try:

Suppose adding a snare hit as a soft open (o) on the "&" of beat 1 and "&" of beat 3, and maybe the "a" of beat 2 and 4? Let me see:

S: -o-- | -o-- | -o-- | -o-- but need to check positions.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to have the snare on the third 16th note of beats 1 and 3. Let's try:

First beat: first 16th is -, second -, third o, fourth -. So "- - o -".

Second beat: we can't hit on the first 16th (downbeat 2), so maybe on the second or third.

Third beat: similar to first.

Fourth beat: avoid first 16th (downbeat 4), so maybe second or third.

Alternatively, to make it simple, let's place the snare on the "and" of beat 1 and 3, and maybe the "and" of beat 2 and 4 but not on the downbeats.

Wait, but the user wants to avoid snare on downbeats 2 and 4. So the snare can be anywhere else except the first 16th of beats 2 and 4.

Let me try adding snare on the second 16th of beat 2 and 4. So in beat 2's second 16th, and beat 4's second 16th.

So for beat 2: "-X--" but using O or o. Since the snare can use O (hard) or o (soft open), or X/x for sidestick. Since the current groove doesn't have any snares, maybe using a soft open hit (o) would fit.

So:

Beat 1: maybe add a snare on the "&" (third 16th) of beat 1: "- - o -"

Beat 2: can't hit on first, so maybe on the second or third. Let's say second: "- o - -"

Beat 3: similar to beat1: "- - o -"

Beat 4: avoid first, so second: "- o - -"

Putting it all together:

S: -o-- | -o-- | -o-- | -o--

Wait, but each beat is four characters. Let me structure it properly:

S: -o-- | -o-- | -o-- | -o--

But let me check each beat:

First beat: positions 1-4 (16th notes 1-4 of beat1): "- o - -"

Second beat: "- o - -" (so the second 16th is the "e" of beat2)

Third beat: same as first: "- o - -" ?

Wait, maybe I need to distribute differently. Alternatively, to make it more rhythmic, maybe:

S: ---- | -o-- | -o-- | -o--

But that would leave the first beat without snare. Alternatively, maybe on the third 16th of beats 1 and 3, and second of 2 and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the user just wants to ensure that there are no snare hits on those downbeats, but since there are none, the groove is already compliant. However, the user might have intended to have some snare hits but not on those beats. Since the current S line is all dashes, maybe the user wants to add some snare but not on those positions. So adding some hits elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and the original had snares on those beats, but in this input it's not. Since I have to proceed, I'll add snare hits avoiding those downbeats.

Let me try adding a snare on the third 16th of each beat except beats 2 and 4's first notes.

So for each beat:

Beat1: positions 3: o → "- - o -"

Beat2: can't hit on first, so maybe third: "- - o -"

Beat3: same as beat1: "- - o -"

Beat4: can't hit first, so third: "- - o -"

Thus:

S: -o-- | -o-- | -o-- | -o--

But each beat's third 16th.

Alternatively, maybe a different pattern. Alternatively, the user might want the snare on the "and" of each beat except the downbeats 2 and 4.

Alternatively, to make it more interesting, perhaps a syncopated pattern. Let's try:

S: --o- | -o-- | --o- | -o--

This way, the snare is on the third 16th of beats 1 and 3, and second 16th of 2 and 4, avoiding the first 16th of 2 and 4.

So the S line would be:

S: --o- | -o-- | --o- | -o--

Let me check each beat:

Beat1: third 16th (o) → okay.

Beat2: second 16th (o) → okay, not the downbeat.

Beat3: third 16th → okay.

Beat4: second 16th → okay.

This avoids the downbeats of 2 and 4. The snare is placed on other 16th notes. Using soft open hits (o) to match the existing ride and hihat's dynamics.

So the final S line would be:

S: --o- | -o-- | --o- | -o--

Putting it all together with the rest unchanged:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: --o-| -o--| --o-| -o--
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Wait, but each beat must have four characters. Let me format correctly with the | separators.

So:

S: --o-| -o--| --o-| -o--

But in the notation, each segment between | is four characters. So:

First segment (beat1): "--o-"

Second (beat2): "-o--"

Third (beat3): "--o-"

Fourth (beat4): "-o--"

Yes, that's four characters each.

So the final drum groove would have the S line as above. Let me confirm that no snare hits are on the downbeats of 2 and 4. The downbeat of beat2 is the first character of the second segment, which is "-", so no hit. Similarly, beat4's first character of the fourth segment is "-", so no hit there. The snare is on the second and third 16ths of those beats where allowed.

Yes, this should satisfy the user's request.
