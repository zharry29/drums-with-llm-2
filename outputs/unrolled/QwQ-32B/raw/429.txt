Okay, let me tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any tom or kick parts from the given groove. 

First, I'll look at the original groove provided. Let me parse each line:

**Kick (K):** O---|---o|O-O-|----
**Snare (S):** ----|O---|----|O---
**Hihat (H):** --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
**Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----
**Crash (C):** O---|----|----|----
**Ride (R):** ----|----|----|----

The user's request is to eliminate the kick (K) and tom (T) parts. Since Toms are already all dashes, I just need to set the K line to all dashes. 

Wait, checking the T line: it's already empty, so no changes there. The main change is the K line. Let me make sure:

- Keep the Snare (S) as is unless there's overlap with toms, but since T is empty, no conflict.
- Hihat (H) stays the same.
- Crash (C) remains, and Ride (R) is untouched.

So the edited version should have K set to all '-', T remains as '-', and others stay unless they had tom elements, which they don't. Let me confirm each line:

**Edited K:** ----|----|----|----
**S remains:** ----|O---|----|O---
**H remains:** --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
**T stays:** ----|----|----|----
**C remains:** O---|----|----|----
**R stays:** ----|----|----|----

Wait, but in the original, the user might have a crash on the first beat. Since they didn't mention removing crashes, it's okay. The key is to remove kick and toms only. The T line was already clear. So the final edited groove should look like that. Let me double-check the user's instruction again to ensure I didn't miss anything. Yep, just no tom or kick. So this should be correct.
