Okay, so the user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing all cymbals and snare. Let me start by understanding the given drum notation and the specific instruments involved.

First, looking at the provided drum groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The instruments here are:
- K: Kick drum
- S: Snare drum
- H: Hihat
- T: Toms
- C: Crash cymbal
- R: Ride cymbal

The user's request is to remove any cymbals (which include Crash C and Ride R) and the snare (S). So I need to zero out those lines.

Starting with the Snare (S line). The current S line has hits in the second and fourth beats. To remove snare, I'll replace all non '-' characters in the S line with '-'.

Next, the Crash cymbal (C line) has hits in the first beat. I'll set all characters in the C line to '-'.

The Ride cymbal (R line) is already empty, so no change there.

Now, check if there are any other cymbals mentioned. The Hihat (H) is a closed hi-hat, which isn't a cymbal in the same category as crash or ride, so it stays unless specified. The user didn't mention hihat, so leave H as is.

Toms (T) are also unaffected since the request is about cymbals and snare.

So modifying each line accordingly:

Original K remains unless specified, but the user didn't mention kick, so K stays.

Resulting in:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, let me double-check each line. The S line had O's in positions 2 and 4. Changing those to '-' makes sense. The C line's first beat O becomes '-', so the entire C line is all '-'. Hihat is still there since it's not a cymbal they asked to remove. The user said "cymbal or snare", so crash and ride are gone, but hihat remains. That should be correct.
