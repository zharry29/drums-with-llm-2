Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to include not only cymbal but also tom. Looking at the provided groove:

First, check the current instruments. The Kick (K) has some hits, Snare (S) has a S--- in the third beat. Hihat (H) is active with x-x- patterns. The Crash (C) is hitting every beat with O---, and the Ride (R) is silent. Toms (T) are all dashes, so that's where we need to add.

The edit request is to add toms. Since the original has toms (T) line empty, we need to decide where to place tom hits. Let's consider the existing structure. The kick and snare are providing the rhythm, so toms can add depth or syncopation.

Looking at the Kick line: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
Snare: ----|----|S---|----
Toms are empty. Maybe adding toms on the offbeats or where the kick isn't as busy. For example, in the first beat, the kick has a hit on the second 16th note. Maybe add a tom on the first or fourth?

Alternatively, in the third beat, the snare hits on the third 16th note. Maybe a tom on the first or second? Also, the fourth beat has a snare on the fourth. Maybe a tom on the third?

Also, the crash is on every beat, so maybe sync with that. Let's think of common tom patterns. Maybe a tom on the "and" of each beat? Like the "&" in 4/4 time.

Breaking down each beat:

First beat: -O-- (kick hits second 16th). Maybe add a tom on the first or third? Let's try T: -O-- for first beat.

Second beat: OO-- (kick hits first and second). Maybe a tom on the third or fourth? T: --O- ?

Third beat: ---O (kick on fourth). Snare on third. Tom on first or second? Maybe T: O--- ?

Fourth beat: -OOO (kick on second, third, fourth). Snare on fourth. Maybe tom on first? T: O--- ?

Alternatively, let's see if the user's previous edits give a pattern. Looking at prior examples, sometimes toms are added on the third 16th note of each beat. For instance, in a previous example, T was ---O in some beats.

Wait, in the given groove, the T line is all dashes. So to add toms, maybe place them where they can complement without clashing. Let's try adding a tom on the third 16th note of each beat. That would be positions like the "&" of the beat. Let's try:

First beat: -O-- | so T: --O- (third 16th)
Second beat: OO-- | T: --O-
Third beat: ---O | T: --O-
Fourth beat: -OOO | T: --O-

But need to check if that works. Alternatively, maybe alternate between O and o for dynamics. Since the kick and snare are using O and S, maybe use O for toms to match.

Alternatively, maybe in the second beat where kick is busy, add a tom on the fourth 16th? Hmm.

Alternatively, let's look at the Toms in previous user examples. In one of the prior responses, when adding toms, they had T: O-o- repeating. Maybe a pattern like that.

Wait, in the user's example where they added toms to a similar structure, like the third example in history, they had T: O-o-|O-o- etc. So maybe a steady tom pattern.

Given that the original T line is empty, let's add a tom on every beat's third 16th note. So each beat's third 16th note has a tom hit. Let's structure that:

For each beat, the third character is a tom hit. So:

First beat: T: --O-
Second beat: --O-
Third beat: --O-
Fourth beat: --O-

But written as T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O- ?

Alternatively, maybe vary it. Let me see the kick and snare to avoid clashing.

Looking at the third beat: S is on the third 16th note (S---), so if we put a tom there, it might clash. Maybe shift it to the first 16th note?

Alternatively, maybe alternate between first and third. Let's see:

First beat: T on third (since kick is on second)
Second beat: T on fourth (since kick is on first and second)
Third beat: T on first (since snare is on third)
Fourth beat: T on first or third?

Alternatively, maybe a simple pattern like T: O---|O---|O---|O--- but that might clash with kick.

Alternatively, let's pick the third 16th note for each beat except where there's a snare. Since the snare is on third of third beat, maybe on first there.

Alternatively, let's go with T: O--- in the third beat and see.

Alternatively, maybe the user's previous examples had Toms on the third 16th note. Let me think of a safe pattern.

Alternatively, since the original T line is empty, let's add a tom on the third 16th note of each beat. So:

T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-

But written as T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-

But let me check the original groove's structure again.

Original T line is all dashes. So adding that would introduce toms without clashing much. Let's try that.

So the edited T line would be:

T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-

But let me write that properly with the bars:

T: --O- | --O- | --O- | --O-

But in the given groove's T line is four beats of four characters each, so yes.

Alternatively, maybe add a soft hit (o) instead of O for a more subtle tom. Let's see the user's past edits. In one example, they used O for toms. Let's stick with O for consistency.

Alternatively, maybe vary between O and o. For example, first beat O, second o, etc. But maybe keep it simple with O.

So the final T line would be:

T: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-

Wait, but let me check each beat's context.

First beat: K is -O-- (second 16th). Adding T on third 16th is okay.

Second beat: K has OO-- (first and second 16th). Adding T on third is fine.

Third beat: K is ---O (fourth), Snare on third. If T is on third, that's same as snare. So maybe third beat's T should be on first 16th instead?

Ah, that's a conflict. In the third beat, the snare is on the third 16th note (S--- means third note is S). So adding a tom there would clash. So need to adjust.

Third beat: To avoid clashing with snare on third, maybe put tom on first 16th note.

So third beat's T: O---

Fourth beat: Snare is on fourth 16th, so third is free. T on third again.

So revised T line:

First beat: --O-
Second beat: --O-
Third beat: O---
Fourth beat: --O-

Thus, T: --O-|--O-|O---|--O-

Alternatively, maybe on the fourth beat, since kick is active on second, third, fourth, maybe tom on first?

Alternatively, let's see:

Third beat's tom on first: O---

Fourth beat: maybe --O- as before.

So putting it all together:

T: --O- | --O- | O--- | --O-

Let me check each beat:

First beat:
K: -O-- (kick on 2)
T: --O- (tom on 3)
No conflict.

Second beat:
K: OO-- (1 and 2)
T: --O- (3)
Okay.

Third beat:
K: ---O (4)
S: S--- (3)
T: O--- (1)
No conflict, adds a tom on first.

Fourth beat:
K: -OOO (2,3,4)
S: ----|O--o (snare on 4)
T: --O- (3)
Okay, since kick is on 2,3,4 but tom on 3 would clash with kick's 3. Wait, fourth beat's K is -OOO, which is second, third, fourth. So tom on third would clash with kick's third. Oops, that's a problem.

So in the fourth beat, the kick hits on 2,3,4. Adding a tom on third would clash. So need to choose another spot. Maybe first or fourth?

Fourth beat's T: O--- (first) or ---O (fourth). Since snare is on fourth, maybe first.

So fourth beat's T: O---

Then T line becomes:

T: --O- | --O- | O--- | O---

Wait but that would make fourth beat's T on first, which is okay.

Alternatively, maybe fourth beat's T on fourth? But snare is there. Hmm.

Alternatively, fourth beat's tom on first.

Thus, T line would be:

--O- | --O- | O--- | O---

But let me check:

Fourth beat:

K: -OOO (2,3,4)
T: O--- (1)
No clash, that's fine.

So final T line:

T: --O-|--O-|O---|O---

But let me write each beat properly:

First beat: --O-
Second beat: --O-
Third beat: O---
Fourth beat: O---

Alternatively, maybe the fourth beat's tom on the fourth 16th note? But snare is on fourth. Maybe soft tom there? But user might prefer not clashing.

Alternatively, maybe fourth beat's T: ---O but with a soft hit o. Since S has O--o, the fourth note is o. So T could be ---o? But the user's instruction says "cymbal and tom", so maybe better to have tom on first.

Alternatively, let's go with the above.

Thus, the edited T line would be:

T: --O-|--O-|O---|O---

Now, check the edit request: "The groove should have not only cymbal but also tom." The crash is already present (C line has O--- in each beat), so adding Toms as above satisfies the request.

So the final groove would have:

K remains same.

S same.

H same.

C same.

T as above.

R remains ---- unless needed, but the request is about cymbal (already there) and tom. So Ride is still silent unless needed, but the user didn't mention ride, so leave R as is unless required. Wait the request is "not only cymbal but also tom". Since cymbals (Crash) are present, adding Toms is sufficient.

Thus the final answer would be:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: --O-|--O-|O---|O---
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
