Alright, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. They don't want any hihat or tom. Let me look at the current groove first.

The current groove has all the instruments except for H and T. The user wants to remove Hihat and Tom. So, I should focus on the Kick, Snare, Crash, and Ride.

Looking at the Kick line, it's "OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO". That seems a bit busy with the O's. Maybe I can simplify it. Perhaps make it more consistent, like all O's or alternate with o's for a softer touch.

Snare is currently "----|O---|----|O---". Since the user doesn't want Snare, I should remove it entirely. So, all lines for Snare will be "----|----|----|----".

Crash is "O---|O---|O---|O---". That's good, but maybe add some variation, like an o at the end of each beat for a softer hit.

Ride is "----|----|----|----". It's a bit plain. Maybe add some X's for a harder hit on the 2nd and 4th beats.

Wait, the user said "I don't want any hihat or tom." So, I shouldn't add anything that brings back H or T. I should make sure only K, C, and R are active.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust each instrument line accordingly, ensuring that H and T are completely removed and the others are edited to fit the request.
