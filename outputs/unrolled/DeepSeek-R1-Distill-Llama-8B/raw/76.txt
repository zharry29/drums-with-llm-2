Alright, so I need to add both cymbal and ride to this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

First, the drum notation:

- Each line represents an instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash (C), Ride (R).
- Each character is a 16th note.
- Four characters between | make a beat.
- Characters can be -, O, o, X, x, etc., each with specific meanings depending on the instrument.

Current groove:

- K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
- S: ----|----|S---|----
- H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
- T: ----|----|---O|----
- C: O---|O---|O---|O---
- R: ----|----|----|----

I notice that the Crash (C) and Ride (R) cymbals are currently playing O--- on all beats. To add some cymbal to the groove, I can introduce some variation to the cymbal patterns. The Ride cymbal uses X and x for different types of hits. Maybe I can add some X and x hits to create a more dynamic pattern.

Let me draft a new C and R line:

C: X---|---X|X---|---

This adds a hard closed hit on the first and third beats, which should add some dynamic contrast to the cymbal patterns.

I also need to add some ride to the groove. The Ride cymbal is currently playing ---- on all beats. To add some ride, I can introduce some patterns here. The Ride cymbal uses X and x for different types of hits. Maybe I can add some o and O hits to create a more varied pattern.

Let me draft a new R line:

R: X---|o---|X---|---

This adds a hard closed hit on the first and third beats, and a soft open hit on the second beat, which should add some dynamic contrast to the cymbal patterns.

I need to ensure that these changes fit within the 16th note structure and don't overlap with the Kick, Snare, or Tom cymbal. Since the Cymbals are on their own lines, I don't need to worry about overlapping with other instruments.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have enhanced Cymbal lines without affecting the other instruments.

Final edited drum groove:
