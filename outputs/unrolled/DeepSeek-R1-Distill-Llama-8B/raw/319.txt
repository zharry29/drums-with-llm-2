Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. The user provided a drum notation system with various instruments like Kick, Snare, Hihat, Tom, Crash, and Ride cymbal. The original groove has the Kick, Snare, Hihat, Tom, and Crash, but the user wants to add the Snare and Kick into the mix, or maybe it's about adding both Snare and Kick? Wait, no, the edit request says "The groove should have not only snare but also cymbal." Hmm, actually, looking back, in the history, the user had a previous edit where they wanted snare and cymbal, so now they want to make sure both are present.

Wait, in the current groove provided, the Kick is present, but the Snare and Cymbal might not be prominent enough. The user wants to ensure that both Snare and Cymbal are included. So I need to adjust the groove so that both Snare and Cymbal are played in each bar.

Looking at the current groove:

K: O---|---O|---O|---O  
S: X---|---X|---X|---X  
H: x---|---x|---x|---x  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----  

So, the Kick is already played on each beat with "O" and "O---", but the Snare is "X---|---X|---X|---X", which is quite active. The Hihat is also playing consistently. The Tom, Crash, and Ride are not being played in this version.

Wait, but the user wants to make sure Snare and Cymbal are present. So maybe the current version is missing Cymbal? Let me check the notation again.

In the original instruction, each instrument's line represents their part. So, for Cymbal, it's either Crash or Ride. The user might be referring to the Ride cymbal as the main cymbal part.

In the current edited groove, the Ride cymbal is not active, as it's all "----". So, to add cymbal, I need to activate the Ride cymbal, perhaps with "X---" or similar.

Also, the Snare is active, but maybe not enough. The user might want both Snare and Cymbal to be prominent in each bar.

So, I'll modify the Ride cymbal to have some activity, like "X---|---X|---X|---X", similar to the Snare. Also, maybe adjust the Kick to have a more consistent pattern.

Let me structure the new groove:

- Kick: Maybe alternate between "O---" and "---O" to create a more dynamic pattern.
- Snare: Keep it active as is.
- Hihat: Keep it consistent but maybe vary the timing a bit.
- Tom: Maybe add some activity on the Tom, like "O---|---O|---O|---O".
- Crash: Maybe add some activity on the Crash, like "O---|---O|---O|---O".
- Ride cymbal: Make it active with "X---|---X|---X|---X".

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have all these elements. I'll write out each instrument's part accordingly.
