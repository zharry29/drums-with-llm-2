Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove. The user wants the groove to have not only snare but also cymbal. Let me look at the original groove first.

The original groove is:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

So, the Kick drum (K) is using o and |, which I think are soft hits. The Snare drum (S) is using X and |, which are hard and soft sidestick hits. The Hihat (H) is using x and |, which are soft closed hits. The Tom (T) and Crash cymbal (C) are not playing anything, and the Ride cymbal (R) is using X and x, which are hard and soft closed hits on the bow.

The user wants to add cymbal. So, I need to modify either the Cymbal parts or the Ride cymbal to include cymbal sounds. Wait, the Ride cymbal is already using X and x, which are closed hits. Maybe I should add more cymbal articulations.

Looking at the notation, each instrument line has 16 characters, separated by | into four beats. Each character represents a note. So, for the Cymbal (C), it's currently all dashes, meaning no cymbal. I can add some O's and o's to represent cymbal hits.

Similarly, for the Ride cymbal (R), it's using X and x, which are already closed hits. Maybe I can add some O's and o's to include open hits as well.

Let me plan the changes:

1. For the Crash cymbal (C), I'll add O's and o's in some beats to represent cymbal hits. Maybe on the first and third beats.

2. For the Ride cymbal (R), I'll add O's and o's on the second and fourth beats to include both open and closed hits.

So, the edited C line would look like O---|O---|----|---O, using O for hard hits and o for soft ones.

The R line would be x---|---O|---x|---O, adding O's for open hard hits and x's for closed soft hits.

Wait, but in the original R line, it's x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-. So, X is a hard closed hit, and x is a soft closed hit. Maybe I can replace some X's with O's to add open hits.

Alternatively, maybe I should add both O and X for different types of hits.

Let me try:

C: O---|O---|----|---O

R: x---|O---|x---|O---

This way, the Cymbal has O's for hard open hits and the Ride cymbal has O's for open hits and x's for closed hits.

Wait, but the user said the groove should have not only snare but also cymbal. So, the main change is adding cymbal to the C and R lines.

I think that's a good approach. Let me apply these changes and make sure everything else remains consistent.
