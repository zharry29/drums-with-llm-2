Alright, so I've got this drum groove to edit. The user wants me to add both snare and kick to the existing groove. Let me first understand the current setup.

Looking at the current groove, I see that the Kick drum (K) is already present with some notation: "O---|---o|O-O-|----". That seems to have some hits, but maybe it's not as prominent as it could be. The Snare drum (S) is "----|O---|----|O---", so it's got some hard hits there. The Hihat (H) is " --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o- ", which is pretty active. The Toms (T) are "----|----|----|----", so they're not playing much. The Crash cymbal (C) is "O---|----|----|----", and the Ride cymbal (R) is "----|----|----|----".

The user wants the groove to have not only snare but also kick. Wait, but looking at the current setup, both Kick and Snare are already present. Maybe the user means they want more emphasis on both, or perhaps they want to ensure both are active and noticeable.

Looking at the Kick drum, "O---|---o|O-O-|----", I can see that there are some hits, but maybe it's a bit sparse. Maybe adding more hits or varying the articulation could make it more dynamic. For the Snare drum, "----|O---|----|O---", it's got some good hard hits, but perhaps adding some soft hits or variations could make it more interesting.

I need to make sure that both Kick and Snare are prominent. Maybe I can adjust the Kick to have more noticeable hits, like using "O" for harder hits and "o" for softer ones. For the Snare, adding some "X" or "x" for sidestick hits could add more depth.

Let me also check the other instruments. The Hihat is already active, so I might not need to change that much. The Toms, Crash, and Ride cymbals are pretty quiet, but since the user didn't mention them, I'll leave them as they are unless I think they need adjustment.

So, my plan is to enhance the Kick drum by adding more "O" and "o" hits, making it more dynamic. For the Snare drum, I'll add some "X" and "x" hits to give it more side stick action, which adds to the groove.

I'll also make sure that the rest of the instruments are correctly represented, keeping the Hihat active and the other cymbals as they are unless necessary.

After making these changes, I'll review the entire groove to ensure that both Kick and Snare are well-defined and contribute to the overall rhythm in a balanced way.
