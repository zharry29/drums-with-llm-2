Alright, I need to edit the given drum groove to include both snare and kick. Let me start by understanding the current groove and the required changes.

First, I'll look at the existing drum groove:

@@@  
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
S: ----|X---|--X-|----  
H: ----|x---|----|x---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

From the K line, I see that the kick drum is currently using "o---" and "--o-", which are soft hits. The user wants the kick to be more prominent, so I should increase the hard hits. Maybe change some "o" to "O" where appropriate.

Looking at the S line, the snare drum is already using "X---" and "--X-", which are hard hits. That seems good, but I should ensure it's consistent across all beats.

For the H line, the hihat is using "x---" and "----", which are soft and not played. Maybe add some "X" for closed hits to make it more dynamic.

The T, C, and R lines don't need changes as per the edit request, but I'll double-check to ensure they're correct.

Now, I'll edit each instrument line:

1. **Kick Drum (K):** Replace some soft "o" hits with hard "O" hits to make it punchier.
2. **Snare Drum (S):** Ensure it's using hard hits consistently.
3. **Hihat (H):** Add some "X" for closed hits to add depth.
4. **Toms (T), Crash Cymbal (C), Ride Cymbal (R):** Keep them as they are unless necessary.

After making these changes, the final groove should have both snare and kick prominently featured.
