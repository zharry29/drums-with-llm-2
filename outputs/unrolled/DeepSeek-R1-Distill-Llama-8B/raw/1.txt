Alright, so I need to add some tom to this drum groove. Let me see what the current setup is.

Looking at the groove, the Kick drum (K) is playing O on the first and third beats, and on the fourth beat, it's a soft hit with 'o'. The Snare drum (S) is pretty straightforward, with '----' on all beats except the second and fourth, where it has 'Oo-o' and 'O--o' respectively. The Hihat (H) is mostly 'x---' on each beat, which I think means open hits on the top and closed on the bottom. The Tom-tom (T) is not playing on any beat except the third, where it has '---O'â€”so that's a hard hit on the third beat. The Crash cymbal (C) and Ride cymbal (R) are mostly not playing, except the Ride has some 'X-x' on the second and fourth beats.

The edit request is to add some tom. So I need to modify the Tom-tom part to include more beats. Looking at the Tom's line, it's currently only playing on the third beat. Maybe I can add a tom on the first and second beats as well. Since the Tom is represented by 'O' for a hard hit or 'o' for a soft hit, I can add 'O' on the first and second beats and keep the third beat as '---O' for consistency.

So, the new Tom line would be 'O---|----|---O|----'. That way, the first beat has a hard tom, the second beat is open, the third beat has a hard tom again, and the fourth beat is open. This should add more tom to the groove without overcomplicating it.

Let me double-check to make sure I'm not conflicting with other instruments. The Hihat is using 'x---' which is closed on the bottom, so adding 'O' on the first and second beats for Tom shouldn't interfere. The Snare is playing on the second and fourth beats, but that's okay because Toms are on different beats. The Ride cymbal has 'X-x' on the second and fourth beats, but since Toms are on the first, second, and fourth beats, that should be fine as they can play together.

I think that's a good balance. The Toms will add a nice tom presence without overshadowing the other instruments. Let me write that down and make sure it's formatted correctly with the | separators and the correct number of characters.
