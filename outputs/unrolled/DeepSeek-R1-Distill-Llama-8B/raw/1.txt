Okay, so I need to add some tom to the given drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The groove is provided in the notation with each instrument line showing their parts. The user wants to add tom, which is part of the Toms (T) instrument.

First, I should review how the Toms are currently represented. Looking at the T line in the current groove: T: ----|----|----|----. That means on each beat, there's no tom hit. My task is to add a tom hit here.

I remember that in drum notation, each section is separated by |, and each section has four characters, each representing a 16th note. So, four sections make up a beat. The user's instruction is to add some tom, so I'll introduce tom hits on the third beat of each section. That should add a nice touch without conflicting with existing kicks and snares.

Let me think about how to represent a tom hit. The T line uses 'O' for a hard hit and 'o' for a soft hit. So, I'll use 'O' for each tom hit on the third beat. I'll modify each section's third part to include 'O---' to add the tom.

So, the updated T line would look like this: T: ----|----|O---|----. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Each section should have four characters, so I need to adjust accordingly. Maybe I should replace the fourth character with 'O' in each section. Let me correct that.

Each section in the T line will now have 'O' on the third beat. So, the first section becomes 'O---', the second '---O', the third 'O---', and the fourth '---O'. That way, each section has a tom hit on the third beat.

Putting it all together, the new T line should be: T: O---|----|O---|---O. Wait, that might not fit correctly. Let me check the notation again. Each beat is separated by |, and each part has four characters. So, the correct way is to have each section's third character as 'O'. Therefore, the T line should be: T: ----|----|O---|---O.

Wait, that still doesn't look right. Let me make sure each section is four characters. So, the first beat is '----', the second '----', the third 'O---', and the fourth '---O'. That way, each section has a 'O' on the third beat, adding the tom hits.

I think that's correct. Now, I'll update the T line accordingly. The other instruments (K, S, H, C, R) remain unchanged unless I need to adjust for timing, but since the user only asked to add tom, I won't touch the others.

So, the final edited groove will have the T line updated with 'O's on the third beat of each section. Everything else stays the same.

To add some tom to the groove, I'll introduce tom hits on the third beat of each section in the Toms (T) line. This will enhance the rhythm without conflicting with the existing Kick and Snare.
