Alright, so I've been given this drum groove, and I need to edit it by removing the kick and cymbal parts. Let me take a look at the original groove first.

Okay, the original groove has four instruments: Kick, Snare, Hihat, and Tom. The Crash and Ride cymbals are also present. My task is to eliminate the Kick and all cymbal parts. That means I need to focus only on the Snare, Hihat, and Tom in the final edited groove.

First, let's break down each instrument line by line. The Kick line is the first one, and I'll need to remove that entirely. The Snare line is next, which I'll keep but ensure there are no cymbal parts in it. The Hihat line is after that, and I'll make sure it only includes the Hihat sounds without any cymbals. The Tom line follows, which I'll keep as is. Then, the Crash and Ride cymbal lines are next, and I'll need to remove those completely.

Looking at the Kick line: "-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-". This represents the kick drum's notes across four beats. Since I need to remove the kick, this entire line will be deleted.

Next, the Snare line: "----|----|S---|----". This shows the snare drum's activity. The "S---" indicates a snare hit on the third beat. I'll keep this line but remove any cymbal parts, which in this case, there aren't any. So, it stays as "----|----|S---|----".

The Hihat line: "x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-". This is the Hihat's part. Each "x" represents a closed hit, and "-" is a gap. Since I need to keep the Hihat, I'll ensure there are no cymbals here. This line remains unchanged: "x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-".

The Tom line: "----|----|---O|----". This represents the Tom drum's activity. The "---O" indicates a Tom hit on the third beat. I'll keep this line as is: "----|----|---O|----".

Now, the Crash cymbal line: "O---|O---|O---|O---". This is the Crash cymbal's part. Since I need to remove cymbals, I'll delete this entire line.

Similarly, the Ride cymbal line: "----|----|----|----". This is the Ride cymbal's part, and I'll remove it as well.

Putting it all together, the edited groove will only include the Snare, Hihat, and Tom lines without any Kick or cymbal parts.

So, the final edited groove should look like this:

S: ----|----|S---|----

H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-

T: ----|----|---O|----

This way, only the desired instruments are present, and the groove meets the request of having no kick or cymbal parts.
