Alright, so I need to add some tom to this drum groove. Let me see what the current setup is.

Looking at the Toms (T) line, it's completely empty except for some dashes. That means the toms aren't being played in the current groove. I need to add some tom hits here without messing up the existing patterns of the kick, snare, hi-hat, crash cymbal, and ride cymbal.

First, I should figure out where to place the tom hits. The Kick drum (K) is playing on the first and third beats with "O--O" and "--O--", and the Snare drum (S) is playing on the second and fourth beats with "Oo-o" and "-o--". The Hi-hat (H) is playing a continuous pattern, so I need to make sure the tom hits don't interfere with that.

Since the Toms (T) line is empty, I can add tom hits on the first, second, third, and fourth beats. But I should consider the timing relative to the other instruments. For example, the kick is on the first and third beats, so adding a tom on the third beat might coincide with the kick, which could be good for a solid rhythm.

I think adding "O" on the first beat, "O" on the third beat, and maybe some "o" on the second and fourth beats could work. That way, the toms have a consistent pattern without overlapping too much with the kick and snare.

So, the updated Toms line would look like this:

T: O---|----|O---|---o

This adds a hard tom hit on the first and third beats and a soft tom hit on the fourth beat. It should add some texture to the groove without conflicting with the existing instruments.

I should double-check to make sure all the other instruments still have their parts. The kick and snare are still playing their original patterns, and the hi-hat is still going. The crash and ride cymbals are also not affected. So, this should work well together.

I think this is a good balance. The toms are now active in the groove, and they complement the existing parts without causing any conflicts.
