Okay, so I need to add some tom to this drum groove. Let me see what the current groove looks like. The user provided the drum notation with each instrument line, and I need to focus on the Toms (T) line to add some tom. 

Looking at the Toms line: it's currently all dashes except for the fourth beat, which has a "---O". That seems a bit sparse. I want to add more tom hits without making it too busy. Maybe I can introduce some tom hits on the first and third beats of each section. 

Let me recall the rules for drum notation. Each section is separated by a |, and each four characters make a beat. So, each section has four beats. The Toms line has four sections, each with four beats. Right now, the Toms are only playing on the fourth beat of each section with a soft hit (o). I need to add harder hits (O) on the first and third beats. 

Wait, but the user's previous examples used O for hard hits and o for soft. So, I should use O for harder tom hits and maybe keep o for the existing soft hits. But I need to make sure I don't conflict with other instruments. Let me check the Kick, Snare, Hihat, Crash, and Ride lines to ensure no overlaps. 

The Kick is playing on the first and third beats with O and o respectively. The Snare is playing on the second and fourth beats with X and o. Hihat is playing on every beat with x. Crash and Ride are not playing on the first section, so adding Toms there should be fine. 

So, I'll modify the Toms line to have O on the first and third beats of each section. That should add a nice tom presence without conflicting with other instruments. Let me write that out. Each section will go from ----| to O---| for the first beat, then ---O| for the second beat, then O---| for the third beat, and ---O| for the fourth beat. 

Wait, no, each section is four beats, so I need to adjust each beat accordingly. Let me structure it properly. 

First section: O---| (first beat), then ---O| (second beat), then O---| (third beat), then ---O| (fourth beat). Repeating this for each of the four sections in the Toms line. 

That should add the necessary tom without conflicting with other parts of the groove. I think that's a good approach. Let me make sure I didn't miss any details in the notation. Each character represents a 16th note, and the | separates beats. Okay, I think I've got it.
