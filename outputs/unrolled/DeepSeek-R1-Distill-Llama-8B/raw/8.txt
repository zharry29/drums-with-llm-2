Okay, so I need to add some tom to this drum groove. Let me first understand what the current groove looks like. The user provided the notation for each instrument, so I should review that to know how to represent the Toms correctly.

Looking at the Toms section, T: O is a hard hit, while o is a soft hit. So, I need to figure out where to place the O's and o's in the bar to add some tom. The current T section is:

T: ----|----|---O|----

That means in the first beat, there's nothing, the second beat has nothing, the third beat has a ---O, which is a hard hit, and the fourth beat has nothing. To add some tom, I can introduce o's in the first and second beats, making it more dynamic.

So, I can change it to:

T: o---|----|---O|----

This way, the first beat has a soft hit (o), the second beat is empty, the third beat has a hard hit (O), and the fourth beat is empty. This should add some tom without overcomplicating the groove.

I should check if this fits well with the other instruments. The Kick drum is -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-, which has O's in the second and fourth beats. The Snare drum is ----|----|S---|----, so the third beat has a S---, which is a snare hit. The Hihat is x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-, which is continuous, and the Crash and Ride cymbals are O---|O---|O---|O--- and ----|----|----|---- respectively.

Adding o's in the Toms should complement the existing groove without conflicting. I think this change will add the necessary tom without disrupting the overall structure.
