Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove. The user wants the groove to have not only snare but also kick. Let me look at the current groove they provided.

Right now, the Kick drum (K) line is empty except for some characters, but it's not very active. The Snare drum (S) is active, but maybe it's too dominant. I need to make sure the Kick drum is prominent too.

I should check the notation system again. Each bar has 16 notes, divided into 4 beats. Each instrument's line shows which notes are played and how.

For the Kick drum, using 'O' for a hard hit and 'o' for a soft hit makes sense. Maybe I can add some variations, like alternating between 'O' and 'o' to create a more dynamic kick pattern.

Looking at the current Kick line: it's "O--O|----|--O-|----". That's a bit sparse. Maybe I can make it more consistent, like "O---|---O|---O|---O". This way, each beat has a consistent hard and soft hit, creating a better rhythm.

For the Snare drum, the user wants it to be active as well. The current line is "----|----|O---|----", which is a bit quiet. Maybe I can add some 'X' for sidestick hits to make it snappier. So, "X---|---X|---X|---X" would give it a nice snare pattern.

I also need to ensure that the other instruments like Hihat, Tom, Crash, and Ride are still present but not too overwhelming. The Hihat can have some 'x' for closed hits, the Tom can have some 'O's for hits, and the Crash and Ride can have their own patterns without conflicting with the Kick and Snare.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust the Kick to be more active and the Snare to have a solid pattern, while keeping the rest balanced. This should meet the user's request of having both Kick and Snare prominent in the groove.
