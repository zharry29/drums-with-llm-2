Okay, so I need to add some kick to the given drum groove. Let me first understand the existing structure and how the kick is currently represented.

Looking at the current K line:
K: O---|O---|----|O---

This means in each beat section (four beats per bar), the kick is played on the first and third beats with a hard hit "O", and the second and fourth beats have no kick, indicated by "-".

My goal is to add more kick without conflicting with the existing patterns. Maybe I can introduce a softer kick on the second and fourth beats. The soft hit for kick is "o".

So, I'll modify the K line to have "O" on the first and third beats as before, and "o" on the second and fourth beats.

Let me write this out:

K: O---|o---|----|o---

This way, each beat section now has a kick on every beat, with a mix of hard and soft hits to add depth.

I should also check if this change affects other instruments. The Snare drum (S) and other lines seem unaffected, so it should be fine.
