Okay, so I need to add some tom to the given drum groove. Let me first understand what the original groove looks like and where the toms are currently. 

Looking at the original drum notation, each line represents an instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R). Each bar is 16 notes, split into four beats. The current Toms (T) line is completely empty except for the separators. So, there's no tom in the original groove.

I need to add some tom to this. Toms are usually played on the 3rd beat of a bar in a 4/4 time signature, but I think in this case, since it's a drum groove, I should look at where the existing snare and kick are to see where the toms fit in without conflicting.

The Kick (K) line has O--O|----|--O-|----, which means the first beat has a hard hit, the second beat is empty, the third beat has a soft hit, and the fourth beat is empty. The Snare (S) line has Oo-o|-o--|O--o, so the first beat is a soft hit, the second beat is a soft open, the third is a soft hit, and the fourth is a soft open. 

Since the current toms are absent, I can add them in the third beat, which is the first '----' in the K line and the third '----' in the S line. That would make sense because the third beat is typically where toms are played in a groove.

I should represent the Toms (T) line with 'O---' on the third beat and maybe leave the others empty for now. So, the T line would be ----|----|O---|----. Wait, no, each beat is separated by |, so each segment is four characters. So the third beat in each section is where I should add the O.

Let me structure it properly. The T line should have four beats, each separated by |. The third beat is where I'll add the O. So, the first beat is empty, the second is empty, the third is O---, and the fourth is empty. That would look like ----|----|O---|----.

I think that's a good addition. It adds a tom on the third beat without conflicting with the existing Kick and Snare hits. I'll make sure to only add the O in the third beat and keep the rest as is.

To add some tom to the groove, I'll introduce tom hits on the third beat of each section in the Toms (T) line. This complements the existing Kick and Snare without overlapping.
