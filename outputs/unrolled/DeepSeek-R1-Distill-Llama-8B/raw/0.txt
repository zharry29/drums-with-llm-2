Okay, so I need to add some tom to the given drum groove. Let me first understand the existing groove and then figure out where to add the tom.

Looking at the current groove:

The Kick (K) line is O--O|----|--O-|----. That's a standard kick pattern with some variations. The Snare (S) has Oo-o|-o--|O--o, which seems to be a snare pattern with some dynamics and open/close hits. The Hihat (H) is X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-, which is a continuous, fast hihat pattern. The Toms (T) and Crash (C), Ride (R) are all resting, meaning they're not playing on this bar.

So, the user wants to add some tom. Toms are usually the floor tom or the rack tom. In drum notation, the T line represents Toms. Currently, the T line is completely resting: ----|----|----|----. I need to add a tom pattern here.

I should decide which tom to add. The user didn't specify, so I can choose a common tom pattern. Let's go with a basic tom pattern on the first and third beats of each bar. So, for each bar, the first and third beats will have a tom hit.

In drum notation, each beat is separated by |, and each four-character segment represents a beat. So, for each bar, the T line would have four segments, each four characters long.

Let me map this out. Each bar in T is four beats, each beat being four 16th notes. So, for each bar, the T line would have four segments. I'll add a tom on the first and third beats of each bar. So, the first beat (segment 1) and the third beat (segment 3) will have an 'O' for a hard hit or 'o' for a soft hit. Since the user didn't specify, I'll choose 'O' for a hard hit.

So, the first segment will be 'O---' (first note O, then three rests). The third segment will be '----O---', wait, no. Each segment is four characters, so the third segment should have the O on the third note. So, for each bar, the T line would be:

First segment: O---
Second segment: ----
Third segment: ----O
Fourth segment: ----

Wait, but that would mean the third beat has a single O, which might not be a full tom hit. Alternatively, maybe have two Os on the third beat? Or perhaps a more standard pattern.

Alternatively, a common tom pattern is to have two hits on the third beat. So, maybe the third segment is 'O-O-' or 'Oo-o'. But since the user just said "add some tom," I think adding a basic pattern would suffice.

Let me structure it:

Each bar in T would have four segments. Let's add 'O' on the first and third beats. So:

Bar 1: O---|----|---O|---
Bar 2: ----|----|----|---
Wait, no, each bar has four segments, so it should be:

Bar 1: O---|----|---O|----
Bar 2: ----|----|----|----
Bar 3: ----|----|---O|---
Bar 4: ----|----|----|----

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Each bar has four segments, so each bar in T should have four segments. So, the T line should be:

O---|----|---O|----
----|----|----|----
----|----|----|----
----|----|----|----

Wait, that's not correct because the T line is per bar. Each bar has four segments, so each bar in T would have four segments, each four characters. So, for each of the four bars, the T line would have four segments. So, the T line would be:

O---|----|---O|----
----|----|----|----
----|----|----|----
----|----|----|----

Wait, that's not correct because each bar is four beats, so each bar in T should have four segments. So, for each bar, the T line would have four segments, each four characters. So, the T line would be:

Bar 1: O---|----|---O|----
Bar 2: ----|----|----|----
Bar 3: ----|----|---O|----
Bar 4: ----|----|----|----

Wait, but that's four bars, each with four segments. So, the entire T line would be:

O---|----|---O|----|----
----|----|----|----|----
----|----|---O|----|----
----|----|----|----|----

But in the original groove, the T line is ----|----|----|---- for all four bars. So, I need to replace that with the new pattern.

Alternatively, maybe add a tom on the first and third beats of each bar. So, each bar's T would have O on the first and third beats.

So, each bar's T segments would be:

Bar 1: O---|----|---O|----
Bar 2: ----|----|----|----
Bar 3: ----|----|---O|----
Bar 4: ----|----|----|----

But that's only two Os per bar, which might be too sparse. Alternatively, have two Os on the third beat, making it a more prominent tom fill.

So, each bar's T segments would be:

Bar 1: O---|----|---O-O|----
Bar 2: ----|----|----|---O-O|----
Wait, no, each segment is four characters, so the third segment would be '---O' or '---o'. But adding two Os on the third beat would require 'O-O' in the third segment.

Wait, but each segment is four characters, so to have two Os, it would be 'O-O-' or 'Oo-o'. Let me think.

If I add a tom on the first and third beats, with two hits on the third beat, that would make the T line have a tom fill on those beats. So, for each bar, the T segments would be:

First beat: O---
Second beat: ----
Third beat: ---O-
Fourth beat: ----

But that's only one hit on the third beat. To have two hits, it would be '---O-O' but that's six characters. Each segment is four, so maybe '---O-' for one hit, and 'O---' on the first beat.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants a more prominent tom fill, so maybe adding two hits on the third beat and one on the first.

Wait, perhaps the standard tom pattern is to have two hits on the third beat. So, the third segment would be '---O-O', but that's six characters. So, perhaps '---O-' for one hit and then another on the next note, but that would require two segments. Alternatively, maybe 'O---' on the first beat and '---O-' on the third.

I think I'll go with adding a single 'O' on the first and third beats of each bar. So, each bar's T segments would be:

Bar 1: O---|----|---O|----
Bar 2: ----|----|----|----
Bar 3: ----|----|---O|----
Bar 4: ----|----|----|----

But that would mean only two bars have tom, which might not be enough. Alternatively, maybe add a tom on every other beat, creating a more continuous fill.

Wait, perhaps the user wants a tom fill in the groove, so adding a tom on the first and third beats of each bar would create a steady tom pattern across all four bars.

So, the T line would be:

Bar 1: O---|----|---O|----
Bar 2: ----|----|----|---O
Bar 3: ----|----|---O|----
Bar 4: ----|----|----|---O

Wait, that alternates the O's between the third and first beats. But that might not look consistent.

Alternatively, have the O's on the first and third beats of each bar, regardless of the bar number. So, each bar's T segments would have O on the first and third beats.

So, each bar's T line would be:

Bar 1: O---|----|---O|----
Bar 2: ----|----|----|---O
Bar 3: ----|----|---O|----
Bar 4: ----|----|----|---O

Wait, but that would have four bars, each with O on the first and third beats. So, the T line would look like:

O---|----|---O|----|----
----|----|----|---O|----
----|----|---O|----|----
----|----|----|---O|----

But that might not look right because the O's are on different positions in each bar. Maybe it's better to have the O's on the same position in each bar. So, for each bar, the first and third beats have O's.

So, each bar's T segments would be:

Bar 1: O---|----|---O|----
Bar 2: O---|----|---O|----
Bar 3: O---|----|---O|----
Bar 4: O---|----|---O|----

But that would mean all four bars have O's on the first and third beats, which might be too much. Alternatively, have two bars with O's and two without, creating a fill in every other bar.

But the user just said "add some tom," so maybe a simple addition would be better. Let's go with adding a single O on the first beat of each bar and another on the third beat of each bar.

So, the T line would be:

O---|----|---O|----|----
O---|----|---O|----|----
O---|----|---O|----|----
O---|----|---O|----|----

But that might be too much. Alternatively, add O's on the first and third beats of each bar, but only in the first two bars.

Wait, maybe the user wants a tom fill in the groove, so adding a tom on the first and third beats across all bars would create a consistent fill. So, each bar's T segments would have O on the first and third beats.

So, the T line would be:

O---|----|---O|----|----
O---|----|---O|----|----
O---|----|---O|----|----
O---|----|---O|----|----

But that's four bars, each with O's on the first and third beats. I think that's a good way to add some tom to the groove.
