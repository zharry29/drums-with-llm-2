Alright, I need to edit the given drum groove based on the user's request. The user wants to remove both the snare and ride cymbal from the groove. Let me break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, I'll look at the current groove provided:

@@@  
K: o---|---O|---O|---O  
S: ----|----|----|----  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----  
@@@

From this, I can see that the Snare (S) and Ride Cymbal (R) are currently not active because their lines are all dashes. However, the user wants to ensure that there's no snare or ride, so I need to make sure that these instruments are completely inactive.

Looking at the Kick drum (K), it's active with some notes. The user hasn't mentioned any changes to the kick, so I'll leave it as is.

Now, I need to focus on the Snare and Ride Cymbal. For the Snare, each beat is represented by four characters separated by "|". Since the user wants no snare, I'll replace each note with a dash. Similarly, for the Ride Cymbal, I'll do the sameâ€”replace all notes with dashes.

I'll go through each beat in the Snare and Ride Cymbal lines and ensure every character is a dash. This means that in the final groove, both the Snare and Ride Cymbal lines will be entirely made up of dashes.

I should also double-check the other instruments to make sure I didn't accidentally change anything else. The Hihat (H), Toms (T), and Crash Cymbal (C) shouldn't be affected since the user only wants to remove snare and ride.

After making these changes, I'll reconstruct the drum groove with the updated Snare and Ride Cymbal lines and present the final result within the @@@ notation as required.
