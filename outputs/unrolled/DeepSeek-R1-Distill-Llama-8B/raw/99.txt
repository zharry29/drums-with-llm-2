Alright, so I need to add both cymbal and tom to this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

First, the drum notation:

- Each line represents an instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash (C), Ride (R).
- Each character is a 16-th note.
- Four characters between | make a beat.
- Characters can be -, o, X, etc., each with specific meanings depending on the instrument.

Current groove:

- K: O---|---o|---o|---o
- S: ----|----|O---|O---
H: x---|---x|---
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O.

This adds a soft closed hit on the second and fourth beats, which should add some dynamic contrast to the hihat patterns.
