Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove by removing the kick and cymbal parts. Let me first understand the current setup.

Looking at the provided drum groove:

@@@
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

Each line here represents a different drum instrument:

- K: Kick drum
- S: Snare drum
- H: Hihat
- T: Toms
- C: Crash cymbal
- R: Ride cymbal

The user wants to remove the kick (K) and cymbal (C). That means I need to eliminate any parts related to Kick drum and Crash cymbal.

First, I'll look at each instrument's line and see how to remove K and C.

Starting with the Kick drum (K), it's currently set to O---|----|O---|----. Since we're removing the kick, this entire line should be replaced with dashes to indicate that the kick isn't played.

Next, the Crash cymbal (C) is currently set to ----|----|----|----. To remove the cymbal, I'll replace this line with dashes as well.

For the other instruments—Snare drum (S), Hihat (H), and Toms (T)—they shouldn't be affected. I'll leave their lines as they are unless there's a specific reason to change them, but since the request only mentions removing kick and cymbal, I assume the other parts can stay.

So, the updated drum groove should look like this:

@@@

S: ----|----|----|----
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
K: ----|----|----|----

@@@

Wait, but I notice that the order of the instruments in the original might affect how the final output is structured. In the original, the order was K, S, H, T, C, R. Since I'm removing K and C, the order might need adjustment. However, the problem statement doesn't specify the order, so I'll keep the original order for consistency.

But just to be sure, let me double-check the original notation:

Original:
@@@
K: ...
S: ...
H: ...
T: ...
C: ...
R: ...
@@@

So, the order is K, S, H, T, C, R. Since I'm removing K and C, the remaining instruments are S, H, T, R. However, the user didn't specify the order, so it's safer to keep the same order but represent K and C with dashes.

Alternatively, if the order is crucial, I might rearrange the instruments, but without explicit instructions, I'll stick with the original order.

Additionally, I need to ensure that the number of characters per beat remains consistent. Each instrument line has 16 characters (excluding |), divided into 4 beats. I'll make sure that each line still has 16 characters after editing.

Also, I need to ensure that the last line is correctly terminated with @@@.

So, the final edited drum groove should have:

- Kick drum (K) line replaced with dashes.
- Crash cymbal (C) line replaced with dashes.
- All other lines remain the same.

Let me write that out clearly:

@@@

S: ----|----|----|----
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
K: ----|----|----|----

This way, the kick and cymbal are effectively removed, and the other instruments remain as they are. I think this meets the user's request accurately.
