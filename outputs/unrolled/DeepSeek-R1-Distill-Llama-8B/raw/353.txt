Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove by removing the kick and cymbal parts. Let me look at the current groove first.

The current groove has four instruments: Kick, Snare, Hihat, Tom, Crash Cymbal, and Ride Cymbal. But the user doesn't want any kick or cymbal, so I need to remove those parts entirely.

Starting with the Kick drum (K:), I see the pattern is O---|---o|O-O-|----. I'll replace all the K lines with dashes to indicate that the kick is not played. So, K: will become ----|----|----|----.

Next, the Snare drum (S:) has ----|O---|----|O---. Since the user only wants to remove the kick and cymbal, the snare can stay. So, S: remains the same.

The Hihat (H:) is --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-. This is fine, as it's a hihat and not affected by the edit request. So, H: stays as is.

The Tom (T:) is ----|----|----|----, which is also unaffected. So, T: remains the same.

Now, the Crash Cymbal (C:) is O---|----|----|----. Since the user doesn't want any cymbal, I'll replace all C lines with dashes. So, C: becomes ----|----|----|----.

The Ride Cymbal (R:) is ----|----|----|----. This is a cymbal, so I'll replace it with dashes as well. So, R: becomes ----|----|----|----.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have only the Hihat and Snare drum active. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any parts.

Yes, Kick and both cymbals are removed, while the other instruments remain. This should fulfill the user's request.

The final edited drum groove, with kick and cymbal parts removed, is as follows:

S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
