Alright, so I need to add some cymbal to this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

First, the drum notation:

- Each line represents an instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash (C), Ride (R).
- Each character is a 16th note.
- Four characters between | make a beat.
- Characters can be -, O, o, X, x, etc., each with specific meanings depending on the instrument.

Current groove:

- K: O--O|----|--O-|----
- S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- H: ----|----|----|----
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: ----|----|----|----
- R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

I notice that the current Cymbal (C) and Ride (R) lines are mostly empty except for the Ride, which has a pattern of o-O repeating. The Crash cymbal is completely empty.

The task is to add some cymbal to the groove, so I need to enhance both C and R lines without conflicting with other instruments.

Starting with the Crash cymbal (C):

Since the current C line is all dashes, I can add some patterns. Looking at other instruments, they use O for hard hits and o for soft hits. I can introduce some O and o hits on the Crash cymbal.

Maybe something like:

C: O---|O---|O---|O---

This adds a hard open hit on each beat, which should add energy to the groove.

For the Ride cymbal (R), the current pattern is o-O repeating. To add more variety, I can introduce some X and x hits, which represent different types of strikes.

Perhaps:

R: X---|o---|X---|---

This mix of X (hard closed hit) and o (soft open hit) should add dynamic contrast.

Putting it all together, the edited groove would have enhanced cymbal lines without affecting the other instruments.

Final edited drum groove:
