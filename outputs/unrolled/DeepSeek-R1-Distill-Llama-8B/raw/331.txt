Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. The user wants to remove any ride or snare drum parts. Let me look at the provided drum groove first.

The current groove has four bars, each with various instruments. The Kick, Snare, Hihat, Tom, Crash, and Ride are all present. The user mentioned they don't want any ride or snare, so I should remove those. That means the Snare (S) and Ride (R) lines should be completely omitted from the notation.

Looking at the original structure, each instrument is listed on its own line, separated by |. So, I'll need to remove the lines that correspond to S and R. Let me check each bar to ensure I remove them entirely.

In the first bar, the S and R lines are present. I'll delete those lines. Moving to the second bar, same thingâ€”S and R are there, so they go. The third and fourth bars also have S and R, so I'll remove those as well.

Now, I should make sure that the other instruments are still correctly placed. The Kick (K), Hihat (H), Tom (T), and Crash (C) lines should remain. I'll adjust the formatting so that the remaining instruments are aligned properly without the missing lines.

I should also ensure that the notation is clean and follows the correct structure. Each line should end with a |, and the characters should be correctly placed. For example, the Kick line in each bar should have the correct beats, and the Hihat, Tom, and Crash should follow accordingly.

Wait, in the user's edit request, they only mentioned removing ride or snare. So, I don't need to change anything else. Just make sure that the S and R lines are gone. Let me double-check each bar to ensure that I didn't accidentally leave any S or R parts.

After reviewing each bar, I'm confident that the S and R lines are removed, and only the Kick, Hihat, Tom, and Crash lines remain. Now, I'll present the updated groove with the removed parts, making sure it's properly formatted and only includes the necessary instruments.
