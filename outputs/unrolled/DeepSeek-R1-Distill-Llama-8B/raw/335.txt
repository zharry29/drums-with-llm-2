Alright, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. They don't want any hihat or tom. Let me look at the current groove they provided.

First, the current groove has Hihat and Tom parts. I need to remove all instances of Hihat and Tom. Let me go through each instrument one by one.

Starting with the Kick drum (K). It's currently set to "----|----|----|----". That means all notes are inactive. I can keep that as is because the user didn't mention anything about the kick drum. So, no changes needed there.

Next, the Snare drum (S). It's currently "----|----|----|----" as well. The user didn't specify any changes for the snare, so I'll leave it the same.

Now, the Hihat (H). It's currently "----|x---|----|x---". The user wants to remove the hihat entirely, so I need to set all notes to inactive. That means changing it to "----|----|----|----".

Then, the Tom (T). It's currently "----|----|----|----". The user wants to remove the tom as well, so I'll leave it as is, but wait, if they don't want any tom, maybe I should set all notes to inactive. Let me check the notation again. Oh, the current T is all inactive, so that's fine.

Moving on to the Crash cymbal (C). It's currently "----|----|----|----". No changes needed here since the user didn't mention anything about the crash cymbal.

Finally, the Ride cymbal (R). It's currently "x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-". The user wants to remove the ride cymbal as well. So, I'll set all notes to inactive, making it "----|----|----|----".

Putting it all together, I'll adjust the H and T lines to have all inactive notes. The rest of the instruments can stay as they are. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The user only mentioned removing hihat and tom, so I think that's all. I'll double-check each line to ensure everything is correctly set to inactive where necessary.

Yes, that should do it. Now, the edited groove will have no hihat or tom parts, as requested.
