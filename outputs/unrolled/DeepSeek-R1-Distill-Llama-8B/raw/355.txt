Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove by removing the kick and cymbal parts. Let me start by understanding the notation and the instruments involved.

First, the drum groove provided has four instruments: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash cymbal (C), and Ride cymbal (R). The user wants to remove the Kick and cymbal parts, so I should focus on keeping only Snare, Hihat, and Tom.

Looking at the original groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

I can see that the Kick (K) and cymbal (C and R) lines are currently empty or have their own notations. My goal is to remove any mention of Kick and cymbals, so I'll set their lines to all dashes.

Starting with the Kick line (K):
Original: ----|----|----|----
After removing: - - - -
But in the notation, each | separates beats, so each section between | should be filled with dashes if the instrument is to be removed.

Wait, actually, in the original response, they kept the Kick line as all dashes. So I'll follow that.

Now, for the cymbal lines (C and R), I'll set all their characters to dashes as well.

So the updated groove will have only S, H, and T lines with their respective notations, and K, C, R lines will be all dashes.

Let me reconstruct it:

S: ----|----|----|----
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
K: - - - -
C: - - - -
R: - - - -

Wait, but the notation doesn't use spaces, just dashes. So it should be:

S: ----|----|----|----
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
K: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

But wait, the user wants to remove Kick and cymbal, so perhaps only S, H, and T should be present.

However, in the original response, they kept the Kick line as all dashes. So I'll follow that.

But in the edit request, the user specifically said "I don't want any kick or cymbal." So maybe only S, H, and T should be present without any Kick or cymbal lines.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Should I remove the Kick and cymbal lines entirely or just set their characters to dashes?

Looking back at the initial examples, when instruments were to be removed, their lines were set to all dashes.

So I'll proceed by setting K, C, and R lines to all dashes.

Final edited groove:

S: ----|----|----|----
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
K: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

But wait, in the original response, the Kick line was kept as all dashes, so I think that's acceptable.

Alternatively, if the user wants to remove the Kick and cymbal entirely, the lines might be omitted, but according to the initial examples, it's better to represent them with all dashes.

So the final answer should have only S, H, and T lines with their notations, and K, C, R lines filled with dashes.

Let me write that properly.
