Okay, so I need to add some cymbal to this drum groove. Let me first understand what the current groove looks like. 

From the given drum notation, I see that each instrument is represented on a separate line. The Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash (C), and Ride (R) cymbal are each on their own line. Each character in these lines represents a 16th note, and each group of four characters separated by | makes a beat. 

In the current groove, the Cymbal lines (C and R) are mostly empty or have simple patterns. The Ride cymbal (R) has some X and x hits, which I think represent different types of strikes. The Crash cymbal (C) is also pretty straightforward.

The edit request is to "Add some cymbal to the groove." Since cymbals are already present, I need to enhance their patterns without conflicting with other instruments. I should consider adding more complex patterns or different types of hits to make the cymbals more dynamic.

Let me look at the current C and R lines:

- C: ----|----|----|----
- R: ----|----|----|----

The current patterns for cymbals are quite basic. To add more cymbal presence, I can introduce different articulations. For the Crash cymbal, I can add some o and O hits, which represent soft and hard open hits, respectively. Maybe add some Xs for hard closed hits.

For the Ride cymbal, I can add some o and O hits to create a more varied pattern. Perhaps change some of the existing X and x to o and O to add soft and hard open hits. Also, maybe introduce some dashes (--) to represent pauses or different articulations.

Let me draft a new C line:

C: O---|O---|O---|O---

This adds hard open hits on each beat, which should add a lot of energy to the groove.

Now, for the R line, I can modify it to have a mix of X, x, o, and O hits:

R: X---|o---|X---|---

This introduces a soft open hit in the second beat, which should add some contrast and interest to the cymbal patterns.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have enhanced cymbal lines without affecting the other instruments. I'll make sure each change is within the 16th note structure and doesn't overlap with the Kick, Snare, or Hihat.

Final edited drum groove:
