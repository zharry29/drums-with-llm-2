Alright, so I need to add both cymbal and tom to this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

First, the drum notation:

- Each line represents an instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash (C), Ride (R).
- Each character is a 16th note.
- Four characters between | make a beat.
- Characters can be -, O, o, X, x, etc., each with specific meanings depending on the instrument.

Current groove:

- K: O--O|----|--O-|----
- S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: ----|----|----|----
- R: ----|----|----|----

I notice that the Tom (T) cymbal is currently empty. To add some tom to the groove, I can introduce some variation to the tom patterns. The Tom cymbal uses X and x for different types of hits. Maybe I can add some o and O hits to create a more varied pattern.

Let me draft a new T line:

T: O---|---O|---O|---O

This adds a hard open hit on the second and fourth beats, which should add some dynamic contrast to the tom patterns.

I also need to add some cymbal to the groove. The Crash (C) and Ride (R) cymbals are currently empty. To add some cymbal, I can introduce some patterns here. The Ride cymbal uses X and x for different types of hits. Maybe I can add some X and x hits to create a more dynamic pattern.

Let me draft a new C and R line:

C: X---|---X|X---|---

This adds a hard closed hit on the first and third beats, which should add some dynamic contrast to the cymbal patterns.

I also need to add some ride to the groove. The Ride cymbal is currently empty, so I can introduce some patterns here. The Ride cymbal uses X and x for different types of hits. Maybe I can add some o and O hits to create a more varied pattern.

Let me ensure that these changes fit within the 16th note structure and don't overlap with the Kick, Snare, or Hihat. Since the Cymbals and Tom are on their own lines, I don't need to worry about overlapping with other instruments.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have enhanced Cymbal and Tom lines without affecting the other instruments.

Final edited drum groove:
