Okay, so I need to add some ride to this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

First, the drum notation:

- Each line represents an instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash (C), Ride (R).
- Each character is a 16th note.
- Four characters between | make a beat.
- Characters can be -, O, o, X, x, etc., each with specific meanings depending on the instrument.

Current groove:

- K: O--O|----|--O-|----
- S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- H: ----|----|----|----
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: ----|----|----|----
- R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

I notice that the Ride cymbal (R) is currently playing o-O on each beat. To add some ride to the groove, I can introduce some variation to the ride patterns. The Ride cymbal uses X and x for different types of hits. Maybe I can add some X and x hits to create a more dynamic pattern.

Let me draft a new R line:

R: X---|---X|X---|---

This adds a hard closed hit on the first and third beats, which should add some dynamic contrast to the cymbal patterns.

I need to ensure that these changes fit within the 16th note structure and don't overlap with the Kick, Snare, or Hihat. Since the Ride is on its own line, I don't need to worry about overlapping with other instruments.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have an enhanced Ride line without affecting the other instruments.

Final edited drum groove:
