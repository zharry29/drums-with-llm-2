Alright, I need to add some tom to the given drum groove. Let me look at the existing groove first.

The Kick drum (K) is playing on the first and third beats with "o", which is a soft hit. The Snare drum (S) has a "X" on the first beat and "X" again on the third beat, indicating hard sidestick hits. The Hihat (H) is playing "x" on the first and third beats, which are soft closed hits. The Toms (T) are not playing anything right now, so I need to add some tom there.

I want to add tom hits in a way that complements the existing kicks and snare without conflicting. Maybe on the second beat of each section in the Toms line. Using "O" for a hard hit seems appropriate since it's a common notation for tom kicks.

So, I'll modify the Toms line to have "O" on the second beat of each section. That should add a nice tom kick to the groove without overlapping with the existing instruments.

Let me put it all together and make sure everything lines up correctly in the bar.
