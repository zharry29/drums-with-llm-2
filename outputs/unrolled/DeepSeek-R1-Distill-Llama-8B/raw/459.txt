Alright, so I need to edit this drum groove by removing the Hihat and Cymbal parts. Let me take it step by step.

First, I'll look at the original drum groove provided. It includes five instruments: Kick, Snare, Hihat, Tom, Crash Cymbal, and Ride Cymbal. My task is to remove the Hihat and Cymbal parts, so I'll focus on the remaining instruments: Kick, Snare, Tom, and Ride Cymbal.

Let me break down the original groove line by line.

Starting with the Kick part (K: O---|----|O---|----). I'll keep this as is because the Kick is allowed.

Next, the Snare part (S: ----|----|----|----). I'll keep this as is because the Snare is allowed.

Then, the Hihat part (H: ----|----|----|----). Since I need to remove the Hihat, I'll set this line to empty.

Moving on to the Tom part (T: ----|----|----|----). I'll keep this as is because the Tom is allowed.

The Crash Cymbal part (C: O---|----|----|----) needs to be removed, so I'll set this line to empty.

Lastly, the Ride Cymbal part (R: ----|----|----|----) also needs to be removed, so I'll set this line to empty.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should only include the Kick, Snare, Tom, and Ride Cymbal parts. So, the final edited groove looks like this:

@@@

K: O---|----|O---|----

S: ----|----|----|----

H: ----|----|----|----

T: ----|----|----|----

C: O---|----|----|----

R: ----|----|----|----

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.
