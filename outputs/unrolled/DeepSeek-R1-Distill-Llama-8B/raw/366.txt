Alright, so I need to edit this drum groove by removing the cymbal and ride parts. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll look at the original drum groove provided. It includes five instruments: Kick, Snare, Hihat, Tom, Crash Cymbal, and Ride Cymbal. My task is to remove the Cymbal and Ride Cymbal parts, so I'll focus on the remaining instruments: Kick, Snare, Hihat, and Tom.

Let me break down the original groove line by line.

Starting with the Kick part (K: ----|----|----|----). I'll keep this as is because the Kick is allowed.

Next, the Snare part (S: ----|----|----|----). I'll also keep this the same.

Then, the Hihat part (H: ----|x---|----|x---). This stays the same too.

Moving on to the Tom part (T: ----|----|----|----). Also remains unchanged.

The Crash Cymbal part (C: ----|----|----|----) needs to be removed, so I'll set this line to empty.

Lastly, the Ride Cymbal part (R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-) also needs to be removed, so I'll set this line to empty.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should only include the Kick, Snare, Hihat, and Tom parts. So, the final edited groove looks like this:
