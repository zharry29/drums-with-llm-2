Alright, I need to add some snare to this drum groove. Let me start by looking at the current setup.

The current groove has:

- Kick drum (K): o---|--o-|o---|--o-
- Snare drum (S): ----|X---|--X-|----
- Hihat (H): ----|x---|----|x---
- Tom (T): ----|----|----|----
- Crash cymbal (C): ----|----|----|----
- Ride cymbal (R): x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

I notice that the Snare drum (S) is currently playing X--- on the first beat, then --X- on the second, and finally O--- on the fourth. To add more snare presence, I can introduce some variation to the snare hits.

Looking at the Snare drum notation, 'O' is a hard hit, while 'o' is a soft hit. Additionally, 'X' and 'x' can be used for sidestick hits, which are hard and soft, respectively.

I can enhance the Snare line by adding some 'o' hits to create a softer contrast and some 'X' and 'x' hits for sidestick action.

Let me draft a new S line:

S: X---|----|----|X---

This adds a hard sidestick hit on the first and fourth beats, which should add some dynamic contrast to the snare drum.

I need to ensure that these changes fit within the 16th note structure and don't overlap with the Hihat, Tom cymbal, or Ride cymbal. Since the Snare is on its own line, I don't need to worry about overlapping with other instruments.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have an enhanced Snare line without affecting the other instruments.

Final edited drum groove:
