Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove based on the user's request. The user provided a drum groove and wants me to remove the snare and cymbal parts. Let me start by understanding the notation and the instruments involved.

Looking at the drum notation, each line represents a different instrument: Kick drum (K), Snare drum (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash cymbal (C), and Ride cymbal (R). Each character in the lines corresponds to a 16th note, and each set of four characters separated by | makes a beat. The user mentioned that they don't want any snare or cymbal, so I need to remove those parts.

First, I'll examine the original groove:

@@@  
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-  
S: ----|----|S---|----  
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-  
T: ----|----|---O|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----  
@@@

I see that the Snare drum (S) and Crash cymbal (C) are present. The user wants to remove both. So, I'll focus on the Kick drum (K), Hihat (H), and Toms (T), and Ride cymbal (R) since those are the ones that should stay.

Starting with the Kick drum (K): The original pattern is -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-. I notice that the first beat has a '-' which means no hit, followed by O, which is a hard hit. The second beat has OO--, which might be two O's and a '-'? Wait, actually, each character is a note, so each part between | is four notes. So, the first part is -O-- meaning the first note is not played, the second is O (hard hit), the third is -, and the fourth is -.

But since the user wants to simplify, maybe I can make it more consistent. Let's consider replacing the complex patterns with simpler ones. Maybe for Kick drum, I can use a common pattern like O---|---O|---|---, which is a standard rock beat.

Next, Hihat (H): The original is x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-. That's a continuous x and x pattern, which is a fast hihat pattern. Since the user didn't mention hihat, but the edit request was specifically about snare and cymbal, I think it's okay to keep the hihat as is.

Toms (T): The original is ----|----|---O|----. That seems like the third beat has a single O. Maybe I can make it more consistent, like O---|----|---O|----, which has a tom on the first and third beats.

Ride cymbal (R): The original is ----|----|----|----. That's a quiet ride cymbal. Since the user wants to remove cymbal, I should remove the ride cymbal entirely. So, I'll replace it with ----|----|----|---- but maybe remove the R line altogether.

Wait, the user said "I don't want any snare or cymbal." So, that means both S and C lines should be removed. So, in the final groove, only K, H, T, and R should remain, but since R is cymbal, maybe remove R as well. Or perhaps the user means no snare and cymbal parts, so only the other instruments.

Wait, the user wrote: "I don't want any snare or cymbal." So, I think that means both S and C lines should be completely removed. So, only K, H, T, and R should remain, but R is cymbal. Hmm, the user might not want any cymbal at all, so maybe remove R as well.

Wait, the original edit request was: "I don't want any snare or cymbal." So, that means both S and C should be removed. So, in the final groove, only K, H, T should remain. But in the initial response, they kept R as ----|----|----|----, which is a quiet ride cymbal. Maybe the user is okay with that.

But to be safe, perhaps remove R as well. So, the final groove would have only K, H, and T.

But in the initial response, they kept R as ----|----|----|----, so maybe the user is okay with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the user means they don't want any cymbal parts, so both C and R should be removed.

Wait, the user wrote: "I don't want any snare or cymbal." So, that includes both S and C, but R is ride cymbal, which is a type of cymbal. So, perhaps the user wants to remove all cymbal parts, including R.

Therefore, I should remove the S, C, and R lines.
