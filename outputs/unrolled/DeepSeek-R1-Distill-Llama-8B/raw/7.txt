Okay, so I need to add some tom to this drum groove. Let me see what the current groove looks like.

First, I'll look at the Toms (T) line. Right now, it's all dashes, which means the tom isn't being played at all in this section. That's probably why the edit request is to add some tom. 

I remember that each section is separated by a |, and each section has four beats. So, I need to add a tom hit in each section. The Toms are represented by 'T' in the notation. Each character in the T line represents a 16th note. 

Looking at the other instruments, like the Kick (K) and Snare (S), they have their own patterns. I don't want to add tom in a way that conflicts with these. So, I'll make sure the tom hits are placed where they fit well rhythmically.

In the first section, maybe I can add an 'O' for a hard hit or an 'o' for a soft hit. Let's try an 'O' in the first section. So, it would look like 'O' in the first position of the T line.

In the second section, maybe I can add an 'O' as well. So, the second position would also have an 'O'. Now, the T line looks like 'O-O' for the first two sections.

For the third section, I want to add a tom hit that stands out. Maybe an 'O' again, but to make it different, perhaps an 'O-O' for the third section. That way, it's a bit more dynamic.

In the fourth section, I can add a single 'O' to keep the pattern consistent but add some variation.

So, putting it all together, the T line would have 'O-O-O-O' across all four sections. Wait, that might be too much. Let me check the rhythm. Each 'O' represents a hard hit, so having four in a row could make the groove too busy.

Maybe I should alternate between 'O' and 'o' to add some variety. So, 'O-o-O-o' across the sections. That way, the tom hits have a nice flow without being overwhelming.

Let me see how that fits into the overall groove. The Kick and Snare have their own patterns, and the Hihat is active. Adding 'O-o-O-o' in the T line should complement these without causing conflicts.

I think this makes the tom section more engaging and adds to the overall rhythm of the song. It's important to ensure that each tom hit fits well within the bar and doesn't clash with the other instruments.

So, the final edited T line would be:

T: O---|---O|O---|---O

This adds tom hits in a way that enhances the groove without overpowering the existing patterns.
