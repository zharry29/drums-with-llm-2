Okay, so I need to add some tom to this drum groove. Let me first look at the existing groove to understand where the toms are currently. The toms are represented by the T line in the notation. Right now, the T line is completely empty except for the beats where there are notes. Wait, actually, looking closer, the T line has "----|----|----|----", which means the toms aren't being played on any of the beats. That's pretty quiet on the tom front.

I remember from the drum notation that each instrument has its own line, and each character in that line represents a note. The toms (T) use 'O' for a hard hit and 'o' for a soft hit. So, to add some tom, I need to introduce 'O's or 'o's in the T line.

Now, looking at the existing T line: "----|----|----|----". This means on each beat, the tom isn't being played. To add some tom, I can replace some of the '-' with 'O' or 'o'. But I need to think about the timing and how it fits with the other instruments.

Let me check the kick drum (K) and snare drum (S) to see how they're playing. The K line has "O---|---o|O-O-|----", so the kick is playing on the first and third beats with 'O's and on the fourth beat with 'O-O'. The S line has "----|O---|----|O---", so the snare is playing on the second and fourth beats with 'O's.

The hi-hat (H) is playing on every beat with 'O's and 'o's, so it's pretty active. The crash cymbal (C) and ride cymbal (R) are also playing on some beats, but the toms are completely quiet.

I want to add some tom without making it too busy. Maybe I can add a 'O' on the first beat and another on the third beat. Let me try modifying the T line accordingly.

So, changing the first and third beats to have 'O's. That would make the T line: "O---|----|---O|----". Wait, but each section is four characters separated by '|', so maybe I should make it "O---|----|---O|----".

But I need to make sure each 'O' is placed correctly. Let me count the characters. Each beat has four characters before the '|'. So, for the first beat, "O---" would mean the first note is 'O' and the next three are '-'. Similarly, the third beat would be "O---" again. But that might make it a bit repetitive. Maybe I can vary it a bit more.

Alternatively, I could add an 'O' on the second beat and an 'o' on the fourth beat. So, the T line would be "----|O---|----|o---". That way, it's not too uniform. But I think starting with just adding 'O's on the first and third beats is a good start.

I should also consider how this affects the overall groove. Since the other instruments are playing on different beats, adding 'O's on the first and third beats should complement their playing without conflicting too much.

Wait, maybe I can add 'O's on the second and fourth beats instead. That might give a different feel. So, the T line would be "----|O---|----|O---". That way, the toms are playing on the same beats as the snare drum, which is on the second and fourth beats.

But I need to make sure that the toms aren't clashing with other instruments. The snare is on the second and fourth beats, so if the toms are also on those beats, it might make the groove too busy. Maybe it's better to add 'O's on the first and third beats where the kick drum is playing. That way, the toms can complement the kick without overlapping too much with the snare.

So, finalizing the T line as "O---|----|---O|----". This should add some tom to the groove without causing too much conflict with the existing parts.
