Okay, so I need to add some cymbal to this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

First, the drum notation:

- Each line represents an instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash (C), Ride (R).
- Each character is a 16th note.
- Four characters between | make a beat.
- Characters can be -, O, o, X, x, etc., each with specific meanings depending on the instrument.

Current groove:

- K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
- S: ----|O---|----|O---
- H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: O---|----|----|----
- R: ----|----|----|----

I notice that the current Cymbal lines (C and R) are mostly empty except for the Kick and Snare. The Ride cymbal (R) is completely empty, and the Crash cymbal (C) is also empty.

The task is to "Add some cymbal to the groove." Since cymbals are already present, I need to enhance their patterns without conflicting with other instruments. I should consider adding more complex patterns or different types of hits to make the cymbals more dynamic.

Let me look at the current C and R lines:

- C: O---|----|----|----
- R: ----|----|----|----

The current patterns for cymbals are quite basic. To add more cymbal presence, I can introduce different articulations. For the Crash cymbal, I can add some o and O hits, which represent soft and hard open hits, respectively. Maybe add some Xs for hard closed hits.

For the Ride cymbal, I can add some o and O hits to create a more varied pattern. Perhaps change some of the existing X and x to o and O to add soft and hard open hits. Also, maybe introduce some dashes (--) to represent pauses or different articulations.

Let me draft a new C line:

C: O---|O---|O---|O---

This adds hard open hits on each beat, which should add a lot of energy to the groove.

Now, for the R line, I can modify it to have a mix of X, x, o, and O hits:

R: X---|o---|X---|---

This introduces a soft open hit in the second beat, which should add some contrast and interest to the cymbal patterns.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have enhanced cymbal lines without affecting the other instruments. I'll make sure each change is within the 16th note structure and doesn't overlap with the Kick, Snare, or Hihat.

Final edited drum groove:
