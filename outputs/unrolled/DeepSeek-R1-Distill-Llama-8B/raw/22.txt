Alright, so I need to add some cymbal to this drum groove. Let me take a look at the current setup.

First, I see that the Kick drum (K) is playing o--- on the first beat, then a soft hit on the second, then o--- again on the third, and finally a hard hit on the fourth. The Snare drum (S) is playing X--- on the first beat, then --X- on the second, and finally O--- on the fourth. The Hihat (H) is playing x--- on the first and third beats. The Tom (T) and Crash (C) cymbals are mostly quiet, and the Ride (R) cymbal has a pattern of x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-.

The user wants me to add some cymbal to the groove, so I need to enhance the cymbal lines without conflicting with the other instruments. 

Starting with the Crash cymbal (C), which is currently quiet. I can introduce some patterns here. Looking at other instruments, they use O for hard hits and o for soft hits. I can add some O and o hits on the Crash cymbal.

Maybe something like:

C: O---|O---|O---|O---

This adds a hard open hit on each beat, which should add energy to the groove.

For the Ride cymbal (R), the current pattern is x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-. This already has some variation with X and x, which represent different types of strikes. To add more dynamic contrast, I can introduce some o and O hits.

Perhaps:

R: X---|o---|X---|---

This mix of X (hard closed hit) and o (soft open hit) should add some contrast and interest to the cymbal patterns.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have enhanced cymbal lines without affecting the other instruments. I'll make sure each change is within the 16th note structure and doesn't overlap with the Kick, Snare, or Hihat.

Final edited drum groove:
