Alright, so I need to edit the given drum groove to include both ride cymbal and snare drum. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the request.

The original groove has the following instruments:

- Kick (K): o---|--o-|o---|--o-
- Snare (S): ----|X---|--X-|----
- Hihat (H): ----|x---|----|x---
- Tom (T): ----|----|----|----
- Crash cymbal (C): ----|----|----|----
- Ride cymbal (R): x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The user wants the groove to have not only ride but also snare. Looking at the current setup, the Snare (S) already has some activity. But perhaps the user wants more snare presence or specific snare patterns.

Wait, the original Snare line is ----|X---|--X-|----. That means on the first beat, it's not played, then on the second beat, X---, which is a hard sidestick, then on the third beat, --X-, which is a soft sidestick, and the fourth beat is not played. So maybe the user wants more snare hits or different patterns.

But the user specifically mentioned that the groove should have not only ride but also snare. So perhaps the current setup already includes snare, but maybe the user wants more prominent snare or a different pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to add snare where it's missing. Let me check each beat.

Looking at each beat in the groove:

Beat 1: K: o (soft), S: ----, H: ----, T: ----, C: ----, R: x (soft)
Beat 2: K: |, S: X---, H: x---, T: ----, C: ----, R: X (hard)
Beat 3: K: o, S: --X-, H: ----, T: ----, C: ----, R: x
Beat 4: K: --, S: ----, H: x, T: ----, C: ----, R: X

Hmm, the Snare is active on beats 2 and 3 with X and x. Maybe the user wants more snare on other beats or different articulations.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the Snare to have both hard and soft hits on different beats. Let me think about how to adjust the Snare line to include more dynamics.

Looking at the Snare possibilities:

- O is a hard hit on the head.
- o is a soft open hit on the head.
- X and x are hard and soft sidestick hits.

So maybe I can add more Snare activity. Let's see the original S line: ----|X---|--X-|----. So on beat 2, it's X--- (hard sidestick), on beat 3, --X- (soft sidestick). Maybe I can add O or o on other beats to include head hits.

Let me try modifying the Snare line to have more variety. Perhaps on beat 1, add o, and on beat 4, add O. So the new S line would be o---|X---|--X-|O---. That way, it has a soft head on beat 1, hard sidestick on beat 2, soft sidestick on beat 3, and hard head on beat 4.

Now, checking the Ride cymbal line: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-. This has X and x, which are hard and soft closed hits on the bow. Maybe I can adjust the Ride to have more open hits, using O and o. So perhaps change it to O---|X-o-|O---|X-o-. That would add more open sounds to the ride cymbal, which might add some variation.

Putting it all together, the updated groove would have:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: o---|X---|--X-|O---
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|X-o-|O---|X-o-

Let me double-check each line:

- Kick: Same as before, adding o on beats 1 and 4 for soft hits.
- Snare: Added o on beat 1 and O on beat 4 for head hits, maintaining the sidestick on beats 2 and 3.
- Hihat: Same as before, but maybe I can add more x on beats 2 and 4 for closed hits, but the user didn't specify that.
- Tom: No changes, as per user request.
- Crash: No changes, as per original.
- Ride: Changed to O---|X-o-|O---|X-o- for more open and closed hits.

This should satisfy the user's request by adding more snare presence and ride cymbal activity.
