Okay, I need to edit the drum groove to include both snare and cymbal. Let me look at the current groove first.

The current groove has the Kick, Snare, Hihat, Tom, Crash Cymbal, and Ride Cymbal. The Snare is already active in all beats, and the Crash Cymbal is not active at all. The Ride Cymbal is active in the first and third beats but not in the second and fourth. The user wants the groove to have both Snare and Cymbal, so I think that means making sure Snare is prominent and adding Cymbal where appropriate.

First, I'll check the Kick drum. It's currently using "O---" for the first beat and "O-O-" for the third beat. Since Kick drum is the foundation, I might want to keep it consistent but maybe add some variation. Maybe change it to "O---" for the first beat and "O---" for the third, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, the Snare drum. It's already active in all beats with "O---". Maybe I can add some variation here too. Perhaps use "O---" for the first and third beats and "O---" for the second and fourth. Wait, it's already consistent, so maybe I can leave it as is but maybe add some dynamics.

The Hihat is currently using "O-o-" in the second and fourth beats. That's good, but maybe I can add some variation, like using "x---" in some beats to create a different feel.

The Tom drum is currently inactive. Since the user wants more cymbal, maybe I can activate the Tom drum in some beats to add texture. For example, in the second beat, use "O---" and in the fourth beat, use "O---".

The Crash Cymbal is currently inactive. I need to add it. Maybe in the second beat, use "O---" and in the fourth beat, use "O---" to match the Tom drum. That way, both cymbal and tom are active in those beats, providing a full sound.

The Ride Cymbal is active in the first and third beats but not in the second and fourth. Since the user wants more cymbal, maybe I can extend it to include the second and fourth beats as well. So, "O---" in all beats.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust each instrument to ensure Snare is active in all beats and Cymbal is added appropriately. I'll also make sure the Hihat and Tom drum have some variation for a better rhythm.
