Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to add some tom to this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the existing structure and what the user wants.

First, looking at the drum notation provided, each line represents a different drum or cymbal. The beats are separated by |, and each section within the | represents a beat. There are four beats per bar, each consisting of 16 notes. So, each | separates one beat, and each character within that represents a 16th note.

The user wants to add some tom to the groove. Toms are typically the T and R lines in this notation. The existing T line has some o-o hits, which I think are soft hits. To add tom, I should introduce harder hits, maybe O's, to make it more prominent.

Looking at the current T line: T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-. This seems to be a continuous O-o pattern across all four beats. To add tom, perhaps I can introduce O hits in specific beats where it won't clash with the existing patterns.

Maybe in the first beat, I can change the O-o to O-O. That way, the tom is more consistent and adds a stronger presence. Then, in the second beat, it's already O-o, so maybe leave it as is. For the third beat, I can add another O, making it O-o-O. And in the fourth beat, maybe switch to O-O.

So, the updated T line would be: T: O-O|O-o|O-o-O|O-O.

I need to make sure that the changes don't interfere with the other instruments. The Kick, Snare, Hihat, Crash, and Ride lines seem to be consistent, so adding O's in the T line should be fine.

Let me double-check each beat:

1. First beat: O-O (hard tom on the first note, then another hard tom on the second note).
2. Second beat: O-o (existing soft hit, so I'll keep it).
3. Third beat: O-o-O (soft hit followed by two hard toms).
4. Fourth beat: O-O (two hard toms).

This should add a nice tom presence without overlapping with other instruments. I think this makes the groove more dynamic and adds some energy to the rhythm.

To add some tom to the groove, I'll enhance the Toms (T) line by introducing harder tom hits in a way that complements the existing patterns without conflicting with other instruments.
