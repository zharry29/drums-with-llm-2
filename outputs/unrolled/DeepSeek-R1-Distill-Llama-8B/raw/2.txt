Okay, so I need to add some tom to this drum groove. Let me first understand what the current groove looks like. 

Looking at the T: Toms line, it's currently set to O-o- on each beat. That seems like a soft hit on each tom. But the user wants to add some tom, so maybe I should add a hard hit as well to give it more dynamics.

I remember that in the drum notation, T uses O for a hard hit and o for a soft hit. So maybe I can change some of the o's to O's to make the tom hits more prominent.

Let me look at each beat. The first beat is O-o-, so maybe I can make the first O a hard hit and the o a soft hit. That would be O-o-. Wait, that's already what it is. Maybe I need to vary it more, like having a hard hit and then a soft hit alternatively.

So, perhaps I can change the first beat to O---, making it a strong, hard hit, and the second beat to ---O, a soft hit, and the third beat back to O---, and the fourth beat to ---O. That way, the toms have a nice rhythm with a mix of hard and soft hits.

Let me check if that makes sense. So, the T line would go from O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o- to O---|---O|O---|---O. That should add some variation and more tom presence.

I think that's a good approach. Now, I'll update the T line accordingly and make sure the rest of the groove remains unchanged.
