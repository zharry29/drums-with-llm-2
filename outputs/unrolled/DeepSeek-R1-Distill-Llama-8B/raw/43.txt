Alright, so I need to add some ride to this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

First, the drum notation:

- Each line represents an instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash (C), Ride (R).
- Each character is a 16th note.
- Four characters between | make a beat.
- Characters can be -, O, o, X, x, etc., each with specific meanings depending on the instrument.

Current groove:

- K: ----|----|----|----
- S: ----|----|----|----
- H: ----|x---|----|x---
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: ----|----|----|----
- R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

I notice that the Ride cymbal (R) has a pattern of x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-. This already includes some variation with X and x, which represent different types of hits. To add more dynamic contrast, I can introduce some o and O hits to create a more varied pattern.

Let me draft a new R line:

R: X---|o---|X---|---

This adds a soft open hit in the second beat, which should add some contrast and interest to the cymbal patterns.

I need to ensure that these changes fit within the 16th note structure and don't overlap with the Kick, Snare, or Hihat. Since the Ride is on its own line, I don't need to worry about overlapping with other instruments.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have an enhanced Ride line without affecting the other instruments.

Final edited drum groove:
