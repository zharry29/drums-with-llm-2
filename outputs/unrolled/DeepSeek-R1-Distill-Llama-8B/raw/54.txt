Okay, so I need to add some cymbal to this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

First, the drum notation:

- Each line represents an instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash (C), Ride (R).
- Each character is a 16th note.
- Four characters between | make a beat.
- Characters can be -, O, o, X, x, etc., each with specific meanings depending on the instrument.

Current groove:

- K: O--O|----|--O-|----
- S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: ----|----|----|----
- R: ----|----|----|----

I notice that the Crash (C) and Ride (R) cymbals are currently empty. To add some cymbal to the groove, I can introduce some patterns here. The Ride cymbal uses X and x for different types of hits. Maybe I can add some o and O hits to create a more varied pattern.

Let me draft a new C and R line:

C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: X---|o---|X---|---

This adds hard open hits on the Crash cymbal and a soft open hit on the second beat of the Ride cymbal, which should add some dynamic contrast to the cymbal patterns.

I need to ensure that these changes fit within the 16th note structure and don't overlap with the Kick, Snare, or Hihat. Since the Cymbals are on their own lines, I don't need to worry about overlapping with other instruments.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have enhanced Cymbal lines without affecting the other instruments.

Final edited drum groove:
