Alright, so I need to add some snare to this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

First, the drum notation:

- Each line represents an instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash (C), Ride (R).
- Each character is a 16th note.
- Four characters between | make a beat.
- Characters can be -, O, o, X, x, etc., each with specific meanings depending on the instrument.

Current groove:

- K: O--O|----|--O-|----
- S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: ----|----|----|----
- R: ----|----|----|----

I notice that the Snare drum (S) is currently playing ---- on the first beat, then a soft hit on the second, then a hard hit on the third, and finally a soft hit on the fourth. To add more snare presence, I can introduce some variation to the snare hits.

Looking at the Snare drum notation, 'O' is a hard hit, while 'o' is a soft hit. Additionally, 'X' and 'x' can be used for sidestick hits, which are hard and soft, respectively.

I can enhance the Snare line by adding some 'o' hits to create a softer contrast and some 'X' and 'x' hits for sidestick action.

Let me draft a new S line:

S: X---|----|O---|X---

This adds a hard sidestick hit on the first beat, a soft open hit on the third, and another hard sidestick hit on the fourth. This should add more dynamic contrast to the snare drum.

I need to ensure that these changes fit within the 16th note structure and don't overlap with the Kick, Hihat, or Tom cymbal. Since the Snare is on its own line, I don't need to worry about overlapping with other instruments.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have an enhanced Snare line without affecting the other instruments.

Final edited drum groove:
