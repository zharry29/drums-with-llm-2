Alright, I need to add both ride and hihat to this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

First, the drum notation:

- Each line represents an instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash (C), Ride (R).
- Each character is a 16th note.
- Four characters between | make a beat.
- Characters can be -, O, o, X, x, etc., each with specific meanings depending on the instrument.

Current groove:

- K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
- S: ----|O---|----|O---
- H: ----|----|----|----
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: O---|O---|O---|O---
- R: ----|----|----|----

I notice that the Hihat (H) is currently empty. To add some hihat to the groove, I can introduce some variation to the hihat patterns. The Hihat uses X and x for different types of hits. Maybe I can add some o and O hits to create a more varied pattern.

Let me draft a new H line:

H: x---|---x|---x|---

This adds a soft closed hit on the second and fourth beats, which should add some dynamic contrast to the hihat patterns.

I also need to add some ride to the groove. The Ride cymbal (R) is currently empty. To add some ride, I can introduce some patterns here. The Ride cymbal uses X and x for different types of hits. Maybe I can add some o and O hits to create a more varied pattern.

Let me draft a new R line:

R: X---|o---|X---|---

This adds a hard closed hit on the first and third beats, and a soft open hit on the second beat, which should add some dynamic contrast to the cymbal patterns.

I need to ensure that these changes fit within the 16th note structure and don't overlap with the Kick, Snare, or Tom cymbal. Since the Hihat and Ride are on their own lines, I don't need to worry about overlapping with other instruments.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have enhanced Hihat and Ride lines without affecting the other instruments.

Final edited drum groove:
