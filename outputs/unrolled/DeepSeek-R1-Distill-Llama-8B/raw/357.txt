Alright, so I need to edit this drum groove by removing the kick and cymbal parts. Let me see how to approach this.

First, I'll look at the original drum groove provided. It has five instruments: Kick, Snare, Hihat, Tom, Crash Cymbal, and Ride Cymbal. My task is to remove the Kick and Cymbal parts, so I need to focus on the remaining instruments: Snare, Hihat, Tom, and Ride Cymbal.

Let me break down the original groove line by line.

Starting with the Kick part (K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO). Since I need to remove the Kick, I'll set all Kick parts to empty or remove them entirely. So, the Kick line becomes empty.

Next, the Snare part (S: ----|O---|----|O---). I'll keep this as is because the Snare is allowed.

Then, the Hihat part (H: ----|----|----|----). This stays the same.

Moving on to the Tom part (T: ----|----|----|----). Also stays the same.

The Crash Cymbal part (C: O---|O---|O---|O---) needs to be removed, so I'll set this line to empty.

Lastly, the Ride Cymbal part (R: ----|----|----|----) stays the same.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should only include the Snare, Hihat, Tom, and Ride Cymbal parts. So, the final edited groove looks like this:
