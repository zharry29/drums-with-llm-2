Alright, so I need to edit this drum groove by removing the Hihat and Cymbal parts. Let me take it step by step.

First, I'll look at the original drum groove provided. It includes five instruments: Kick, Snare, Hihat, Tom, Crash Cymbal, and Ride Cymbal. My task is to remove the Hihat and Cymbal parts, so I'll focus on the remaining instruments: Kick, Snare, Tom, and Ride Cymbal.

Let me break down the original groove line by line.

Starting with the Kick part (K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.
