Alright, so I need to add some hihat to this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

First, the drum notation:

- Each line represents an instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash (C), Ride (R).
- Each character is a 16th note.
- Four characters between | make a beat.
- Characters can be -, O, o, X, x, etc., each with specific meanings depending on the instrument.

Current groove:

- K: O--O|----|--O-|----
- S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- H: ----|----|----|----
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: ----|----|----|----
- R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

I notice that the Hihat (H) is currently playing ---- on all beats. To add some hihat to the groove, I can introduce some variation to the hihat patterns. The Hihat uses X and x for different types of hits. Maybe I can add some o and O hits to create a more varied pattern.

Let me draft a new H line:

H: x---|---x|---x|---

This adds a soft closed hit on the second and fourth beats, which should add some dynamic contrast to the hihat patterns.

I need to ensure that these changes fit within the 16th note structure and don't overlap with the Kick, Snare, or Tom cymbal. Since the Hihat is on its own line, I don't need to worry about overlapping with other instruments.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have an enhanced Hihat line without affecting the other instruments.

Final edited drum groove:
