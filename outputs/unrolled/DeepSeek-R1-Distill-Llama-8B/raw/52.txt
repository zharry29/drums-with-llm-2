Alright, so I need to add some hihat to this drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

First, the drum notation:

- Each line represents an instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Tom (T), Crash (C), Ride (R).
- Each character is a 16th note.
- Four characters between | make a beat.
- Characters can be -, O, o, X, x, etc., each with specific meanings depending on the instrument.

Current groove:

- K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
- S: ----|O---|----|O---
- H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: O---|----|----|----
- R: ----|----|----|----

I notice that the Hihat (H) is currently playing --o on the first beat, then O-o on the second, then O-o on the third, and finally O-o on the fourth. To add some hihat to the groove, I can introduce some variation to the hihat patterns. The Hihat uses X and x for different types of hits. Maybe I can add some X and x hits to create a more dynamic pattern.

Let me draft a new H line:

H: X---|---X|X---|---

This adds a hard closed hit on the first and third beats, which should add some dynamic contrast to the hihat patterns.

I need to ensure that these changes fit within the 16th note structure and don't overlap with the Kick, Snare, or Tom cymbal. Since the Hihat is on its own line, I don't need to worry about overlapping with other instruments.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should have an enhanced Hihat line without affecting the other instruments.

Final edited drum groove:
