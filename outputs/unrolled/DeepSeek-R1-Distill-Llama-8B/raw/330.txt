Alright, so I need to edit the given drum groove by removing the ride cymbal and snare drum parts. Let me go through each instrument one by one to figure out what needs to be changed.

First, looking at the Kick drum (K). The original is OOO-|--O-|OOO-. I think that's four beats. Each 'O' is a hard hit, so I can keep those as they are. The '-' might indicate a rest or a different hit, but since the user didn't specify any changes for the kick, I'll leave it as is.

Next, the Snare drum (S). The original is ----|O---|----|O---. The user wants no snare, so I need to remove all the 'O's and any other snare notation. That means replacing those positions with '-' or removing them entirely. So, each |O--- becomes ----, and the same for the last one. So the S line becomes all dashes.

Now, the Hihat (H). It was ----|----|----|----. Since the user didn't mention anything about the hihat, I'll leave it as is. It's already all open or closed hits, but without any X or x, so maybe it's open throughout.

The Tom-toms (T) are also ----|----|----|----. Again, no changes needed here as per the request.

Crash cymbal (C) was O---|O---|O---|O---. I need to remove the crash cymbal, so I'll replace each 'O' with '-'. So each section becomes ---, making the entire C line all dashes.

Ride cymbal (R) was ----|----|----|----. The user wants no ride cymbal, so I'll replace each |---- with ----, effectively making the entire R line all dashes.

Putting it all together, I'll go through each instrument and apply the necessary changes. Let me double-check each line to ensure I didn't miss any parts. Kick remains the same, snare and ride are removed, hihat and toms stay as they are. Crash cymbal is also removed.

I think that covers everything the user requested. Now, I'll format the edited groove with the correct notation.
