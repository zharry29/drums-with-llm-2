Okay, so I need to help this user who wants to edit a drum groove by removing the kick and cymbal parts. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, I look at the drum notation provided. Each line represents a different drum or cymbal. The user wants to eliminate the Kick (K) and any cymbal parts, which are Crash (C) and Ride (R). That means I'll need to focus only on the Snare (S) and Hihat (H) in the groove.

Looking at the current groove, I see that the Kick line has some active notes, so I'll need to remove those. The Snare and Hihat lines are already present, but I should ensure they are the only ones left. The Crash and Ride lines have all '-' which means they aren't being used, so I can leave them as is or remove them entirely. But since the user only mentioned not wanting any cymbal, I think removing them would be better to keep the structure clean.

Next, I'll go through each instrument one by one. Starting with Kick, I'll replace each active note with a '-', making sure that each position in the bar is covered. Then, for the Snare and Hihat, I'll keep their existing patterns but ensure they fit correctly within the same bar structure.

I also need to make sure that each line has exactly 16 characters, excluding the | separators. That means each beat section (between |) should have four characters, and there are four beats in a bar, making 16 notes in total. I'll double-check each line to ensure consistency.

After editing, I'll present the final groove with only Snare and Hihat, making sure it's properly formatted and aligns with the notation guidelines. I should also mention that I've removed the unwanted parts clearly so the user knows the changes made.

Finally, I'll review everything to ensure there are no mistakes and that all the rules of the drum notation are followed. This way, the user gets a clean and accurate drum groove that meets their request.
