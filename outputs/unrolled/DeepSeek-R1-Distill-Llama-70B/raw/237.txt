Okay, so I'm trying to edit this drum groove to include both snare and tom. Let me start by understanding the original groove. The kick drum (K) has a soft hit on the second note of each beat, and the snare (S) is using sidestick hits on beats 2 and 4. The hihat (H) is playing on the offbeats, and the ride cymbal (R) is playing a steady rhythm with some variations.

The user wants the groove to have not only snare but also tom. So, I need to add tom hits without disrupting the existing snare pattern. Looking at the original groove, the tom is already playing a soft hit on the fourth note of the fourth beat. I think adding more tom hits could enhance the rhythm.

I'll start by adding a soft tom hit on the second note of the second beat. This will complement the snare's sidestick on the same beat. I'll also add another soft tom hit on the fourth note of the second beat to create a more dynamic rhythm. 

I need to make sure that the tom hits don't clash with the snare or kick. Placing them on the offbeats should work well. I'll adjust the Hihat to play closed hits (x) on the beats where the tom is playing to maintain a balanced sound.

Finally, I'll review the entire groove to ensure that all the hits are in sync and that the rhythm flows smoothly. I'll make sure the notation is correct, with each character representing the right articulation for each instrument.
