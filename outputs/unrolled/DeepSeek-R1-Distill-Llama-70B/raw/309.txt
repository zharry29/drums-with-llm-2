Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both snare and cymbals. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided. It looks like the kick drum is pretty busy, and the snare is only on beats 2 and 4. The crash cymbal is on every beat, which is quite heavy. There's no ride cymbal or hihat, and the toms are silent.

The user's request is to have not only snare but also cymbals. So, I need to ensure both snare and cymbals are prominently featured. I notice that the crash cymbal is already on every beat, which is a lot. Maybe I can make it less busy by having it only on key beats. Also, adding a ride cymbal with a dynamic pattern would add texture without overwhelming the groove.

I'll start by simplifying the kick drum to play on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits. This will provide a solid foundation without being too busy. The snare drum should be more prominent, so I'll keep the hard hits on beats 2 and 4. For the cymbals, I'll have the crash cymbal on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits and the ride cymbal with a mix of soft and hard hits to add interest.

I'll make sure the hihat is added with a steady rhythm, using soft closed hits on every offbeat. The toms can remain silent to keep the focus on the snare and cymbals. This way, the groove remains balanced and dynamic, with both snare and cymbals featured prominently.

Finally, I'll review the changes to ensure all elements work together cohesively, providing a solid foundation, clear snare backbeats, and dynamic cymbal work.

Here's the final drum groove with both snare and cymbals prominently featured:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: x---|X---|x---|X---
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Snare Drum (S):** Added hard hits ("O") on beats 2 and 4, creating a driving backbeat.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Simplified to play on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits ("O"), providing strong accents.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with a dynamic pattern alternating between soft ("x") and hard ("X") hits, complementing the crash cymbal.
- **Kick Drum (K):** Simplified to play on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits ("O") to provide a solid foundation.
- **Hihat (H):** Added soft closed hits ("x") on every offbeat to provide a steady rhythm.
- **Toms (T):** Kept silent to avoid overcrowding the groove.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and cymbals featured prominently.
