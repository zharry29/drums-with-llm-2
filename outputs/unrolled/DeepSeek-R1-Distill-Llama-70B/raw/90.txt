Alright, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove by adding more hihat. The user has provided a specific drum notation format, and I need to make sure I follow that correctly. Let me start by understanding the current groove they have.

Looking at the given groove, the hihat part is pretty minimal. It only has a few 'x' and '-' in the H line. The user wants more hihat, so I should think about where to add hits to make it more dynamic.

I remember that in drum notation, 'x' represents a closed hit on the hihat, and 'o' is an open hit. Since the user wants more hihat, maybe adding some alternating patterns between closed and open hits would make it more interesting.

I should also consider the balance between the kick and the hihat. The kick is already present in the K line, so adding hihat in complementary spots can create a better rhythm section.

Let me look at each beat and see where I can add hihat hits without clashing with the other instruments. For example, in the first beat, adding an 'x' on the second note could create a nice syncopation. In the second beat, maybe an 'o' on the third note to add some openness.

I also need to ensure that the hihat pattern doesn't overpower the snare and toms but complements them. Maybe adding a mix of closed and open hits in different parts of the bar will achieve that balance.

I should also check if adding too many hihat hits makes the groove too busy. It's important to keep it tasteful and in line with the overall feel the user is aiming for.

After considering all these factors, I'll draft the new groove, making sure to follow the notation correctly and only include the final version between the '@@@' as the user requested.
