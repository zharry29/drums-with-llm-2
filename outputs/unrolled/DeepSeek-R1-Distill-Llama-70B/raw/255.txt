Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, the user has provided a drum groove and wants me to edit it to include both kick and ride cymbal. I need to use the given notation and make sure the final answer is between @@@.

First, I need to understand the notation. Each line represents a different drum instrument. The characters in each line denote hits on 16th notes. 'O' is a hard hit, 'o' is a soft hit, and '-' means no hit. For the ride cymbal, 'O' is a hard open hit on the bell, and 'X' and 'x' are hard and soft closed hits on the bow.

Looking at the given groove, the kick drum (K) has hits on the first and third beats in the first and third bars. The snare drum (S) has some hits, but the ride cymbal (R) is completely empty. The user wants the groove to include both kick and ride, so I need to add ride cymbal hits where appropriate.

I'll start by adding ride cymbal hits. Since the kick is on beats 1 and 3, the ride can complement that by playing on the off-beats or in between. Maybe adding 'X' on the 2nd and 4th beats in each bar would create a nice rhythm without clashing with the kick.

I'll go through each bar and add 'X' to the ride cymbal line where it makes sense. I'll make sure not to overload it and keep the groove balanced. After adding the ride hits, I'll double-check to ensure the notation is correct and that the ride and kick are both present as requested.

Finally, I'll format the edited groove between @@@ as instructed.
