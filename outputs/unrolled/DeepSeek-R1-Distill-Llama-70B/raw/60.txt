Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to add cymbals to a groove that currently has kick, snare, and ride. I need to make sure that the cymbals are incorporated smoothly without overpowering the existing elements.

First, I'll look at the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** O--O|----|--O-|----
- **Snare (S):** ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- **Hihat (H):** ----|----|----|----
- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----
- **Crash (C):** ----|----|----|----
- **Ride (R):** o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

The user wants more cymbal presence, which includes crash and ride cymbals. I notice that the ride is already being used, but the crash isn't. So, I'll focus on adding crash cymbals to enhance the groove.

I'll add crash cymbals on beats 1 and 3 of the first and third bars to give the groove a more dynamic feel. This means placing an "O" in the crash line at those positions. I'll keep the ride cymbal pattern as is since it's already contributing to the rhythm.

Here's how the updated groove will look:

- **Kick (K):** O--O|----|--O-|----
- **Snare (S):** ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- **Hihat (H):** ----|----|----|----
- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----
- **Crash (C):** O---|----|O---|----
- **Ride (R):** o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

This addition should make the groove more vibrant and give it the cymbal presence the user is asking for without overwhelming the other instruments.
