Alright, so I've got this task where I need to modify a drum groove to include both tom and ride. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, I'm given a drum notation system where each line represents a different drum or cymbal. The lines are for Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash cymbal (C), and Ride cymbal (R). Each character in these lines represents a 16th note, and the | symbol separates the beats. There are 16 characters per line, making up 4 beats.

The user provided a specific drum groove that currently doesn't have any tom hits. The edit request is to modify this groove so that it includes not only the ride but also the tom.

Let me look at the given groove:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

From this, I can see that the Hihat (H) is being played on the 5th and 13th 16th notes, and the Ride (R) is being played on the 1st, 4th, 9th, 12th, and 16th notes. The other instruments are not being played.

The task is to add tom hits to this groove. Since the user wants the groove to have both ride and tom, I need to decide where to place the tom hits without disrupting the existing ride pattern too much.

I should consider the musicality of adding toms. Toms are often used to add flavor and rhythm, so placing them on off-beats or in a pattern that complements the ride could work well.

Looking at the Ride (R) line: `x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-`
This translates to:
- 1st note: x (soft closed hit on the bow)
- 4th note: X (hard closed hit on the bow)
- 9th note: x (soft closed hit on the bow)
- 12th note: X (hard closed hit on the bow)
- 16th note: - (not played)

I need to add tom hits. Let's choose the 3rd and 7th notes, which are currently empty, to add some tom hits. Using 'O' for hard hits on the toms.

So, modifying the T line:
```
T: ----|---O|----|---O
```

This adds hard tom hits on the 3rd and 7th notes, which should complement the ride without clashing.

Now, putting it all together, the modified groove with both ride and tom would look like this:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|---O|----|---O
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

This way, the groove now includes both ride and tom, fulfilling the edit request.
