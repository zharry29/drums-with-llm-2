Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to modify the given groove so that it includes both snare and tom hits. Let's break down the original groove first.

Looking at the original groove, I see that the kick drum (K) has a solid pattern with hits on beats 1, 2, and 4. The snare drum (S) only has a soft hit on the third beat of the fourth bar, which is pretty minimal. The hihat (H) is playing a steady 16th-note pattern, and the toms (T) have a hit on the third beat of the third bar. The crash cymbal (C) is played on the first beat of each bar, and the ride cymbal (R) isn't used at all.

The user's edit request is to add more snare and tom hits. So, I need to enhance the snare and tom parts without disrupting the existing rhythm too much.

First, I'll look at the snare drum. In the original, it's only on the third beat of the fourth bar. To make it more prominent, I'll add soft open hits (o) on beats 2 and 4 in each bar. This creates a more consistent backbeat, which is common in many genres.

Next, for the toms (T), I notice they only have a hit on the third beat of the third bar. To make the groove more dynamic, I'll add soft hits (o) on the "and" of beat 2 in each bar. This adds a subtle rhythm that complements the kick and snare without overpowering them.

I'll keep the kick drum (K) and crash cymbal (C) patterns the same to maintain the foundational rhythm. The hihat (H) will continue with its steady 16th-note pattern to keep the groove moving. Since the ride cymbal (R) wasn't used, I'll leave it out to keep the focus on the snare and toms.

Putting it all together, the new groove should have a more balanced and engaging rhythm with the added snare and tom hits, while still maintaining the original feel and structure.
