Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove to include both cymbal and snare. Let me look at the original groove first.

The original groove has the kick drum (K) on beats 1, 2, and 4, with a soft hit on the second beat. The snare drum (S) is only on beat 3. The hihat (H) is on every 16th note, which is a pretty steady rhythm. The toms (T) are on the "and" of beat 3 in the third bar, and the crash cymbal (C) is on beat 1 of every bar. The ride cymbal (R) isn't used at all.

The edit request is to have not only the cymbal but also the snare. So, I need to make sure both the snare and the cymbal are present in the groove. 

First, I notice that the snare is only on beat 3. To make it more prominent, I'll add it to beat 1 as well, giving it a more driving rhythm. I'll use "S" for the snare hits to keep it consistent.

Next, the crash cymbal is already on beat 1, but I'll add it to beat 3 to match the snare and create a bigger sound on those beats. This way, the cymbal and snare will hit together, emphasizing those beats.

I'll leave the kick drum pattern as is because it provides a solid foundation. The hihat is already steady, so I won't change that. The toms are only on the "and" of beat 3, which adds some flavor without overpowering the other elements.

Finally, I'll make sure the ride cymbal isn't used since the crash cymbal is handling the accents. 

Putting it all together, the new groove should have the snare on beats 1 and 3, the crash cymbal on those same beats, and keep the rest of the rhythm section tight.
