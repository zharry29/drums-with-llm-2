Okay, so I need to add some cymbal to the drum groove. Let me look at the given notation and understand what each line represents. 

The user provided a drum groove with the following instruments: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash cymbal (C), and Ride cymbal (R). Each character in a line represents a 16th note, and the beats are separated by "|". A "-" means the instrument isn't played on that note, while letters indicate specific articulations.

The current groove is:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I need to add some cymbal. The cymbals here are Crash (C) and Ride (R). The user wants more cymbal in the groove, so I should add hits to either C or R.

Looking at the groove, the Kick and Snare are already providing a basic rhythm, and the Hihat is playing on every 16th note, which is pretty busy. The Toms, Crash, and Ride are not played at all.

To add cymbal, I can introduce Crash cymbal hits on the "and" of beats to add accents. Alternatively, I could add Ride cymbal patterns to create a more dynamic rhythm.

Let me think about where to place the cymbals. Maybe adding a Crash on the first beat of each measure could give a strong accent. Also, adding some Ride cymbal hits on off-beats could add movement.

I'll start by adding a Crash cymbal on the first beat of the first and third measures. Then, I'll add some Ride cymbal hits on the off-beats in the second and fourth measures. This should blend well with the existing Hihat pattern without overpowering it.

So, the updated groove would look like:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: ----|---O|----|---O

This way, the cymbals are added strategically to enhance the groove without making it too busy.
