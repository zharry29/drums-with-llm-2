Alright, I need to edit the given drum groove so that it includes both kick and snare. Let me look at the original groove first.

The original groove has:
- **Kick (K):** O---|---o|O-O-|----
- **Snare (S):** ----|O---|----|O---
- **Hihat (H):** --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----
- **Crash (C):** O---|----|----|----
- **Ride (R):** ----|----|----|----

I notice that the kick drum is already present and active, especially in the third beat with "O-O-". The snare drum is also present but could be more prominent. The hihat is providing a steady rhythm, which is good. The crash cymbal is only at the beginning, which might be a bit sparse.

The user wants the groove to have not only kick but also snare. So, I should ensure that both the kick and snare are clearly present and balanced. Maybe I can add more snare hits to make it more dynamic.

Let me think about how to adjust the snare. In the original, the snare is on beats 2 and 4, which is standard. To make it more prominent, I could add more snare hits, perhaps on the off-beats or with different articulations.

Looking at the hihat, it's alternating between open and closed hits, which is good. Maybe I can keep that as it is since it's providing a nice rhythm.

The crash cymbal is only at the beginning. Maybe adding another crash on beat 3 could add more energy to the groove.

For the kick drum, it's already quite active, so I might not need to change it much. But I can ensure it's balanced with the snare.

Let me try to adjust the snare and crash cymbal.

- **Snare (S):** I'll add more snare hits, maybe on the "and" of beat 1 and the "and" of beat 3 to give it more drive.
- **Crash (C):** I'll add a crash on beat 3 to match the kick drum's activity.

So, the updated groove would look like this:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|----|O---|----  
R: ----|----|----|----  

This way, both the kick and snare are prominent, and the crash cymbals add accents for more energy.
