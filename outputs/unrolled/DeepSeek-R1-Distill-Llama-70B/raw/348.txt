Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove both the snare and cymbals from the given pattern. First, I need to understand the original groove to see where the snare and cymbals are placed.

Looking at the original groove, the snare drum has backbeats on beats 2 and 4. The crash cymbal is on the first beat of each measure. Since the user doesn't want any snare or cymbals, I'll need to remove these hits.

I'll start by setting all snare drum hits to "-", which means they won't be played. Similarly, I'll remove the crash cymbal hits by setting those positions to "-".

The kick drum and hihat can remain to keep the rhythm going. The kick drum provides the foundational pulse, and the hihat adds texture without being too prominent.

After making these changes, I'll review the groove to ensure that no snare or cymbal hits are present. This way, the rhythm stays intact but is more minimalist, focusing solely on the kick and hihat.

Finally, I'll present the revised groove in the correct notation, ensuring it's clean and adheres to the user's request.

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This groove now features:
- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern to provide a solid foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".
- **Hihat (H):** Maintained its dynamic pattern with hard closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** Kept silent as per the original groove.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focused on the kick and hihat without any snare or cymbal hits.
