Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to modify the given drum pattern to include both tom and cymbal elements. Let's break down the original groove to understand what needs to be changed.

First, looking at the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** It has a solid pattern with hits on beats 1, 2, and 4, and some syncopation. This provides a strong foundation.
- **Snare (S):** There's a soft snare on beat 3 in the third bar, but it's pretty minimal. The user wants more snare presence, so I'll need to add more snare hits, probably on beats 2 and 4 for a backbeat feel.
- **Hihat (H):** It's playing steady 16th notes, which is good for rhythm, but maybe adding some variations could make it more interesting.
- **Toms (T):** There's a single tom hit in the third bar. The user wants more tom presence, so I'll add more tom hits, perhaps on off-beats to add flavor.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** It's playing on every beat, which might be too much. Maybe using crash cymbals sparingly on key points like the beginning of phrases would be better.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** It's not used at all. Adding ride cymbal hits could add texture, especially on off-beats or to complement the hihat.

Now, considering the edit request: "The groove should have not only tom but also cymbal." This means I need to ensure both toms and cymbals are well-represented in the groove.

Here's my plan:

1. **Snare Drum (S):** Add snare hits on beats 2 and 4 in each bar to create a standard backbeat. Use soft open hits (S) to keep it subtle.
2. **Toms (T):** Add more tom hits, perhaps on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4 in each bar to create a driving rhythm.
3. **Crash Cymbal (C):** Use crash cymbals on the first beat of each bar to mark the start of a new phrase, and maybe on the fourth beat to add emphasis.
4. **Ride Cymbal (R):** Add ride cymbal hits on off-beats to add texture and rhythm without overpowering the other elements.

Let me visualize the changes:

- **Kick (K):** Keep the original pattern as it's solid.
- **Snare (S):** Add soft snare hits on beats 2 and 4 in each bar.
- **Hihat (H):** Keep the steady 16th notes but maybe add some variations with closed hits (x) for dynamics.
- **Toms (T):** Add hits on the off-beats to add flavor.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Use on beats 1 and 4 for emphasis.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Add hits on off-beats to complement the rhythm.

Putting it all together, the new groove should have a balanced mix of kick, snare, toms, and cymbals, creating a cohesive and engaging rhythm section.
