Alright, so I need to edit this drum groove to include both tom and snare. Let me look at the original groove first.

The original groove has the kick drum (K), snare drum (S), hihat (H), and crash cymbal (C), but I notice that the tom (T) and ride cymbal (R) aren't being used. My task is to add both tom and snare to the groove.

First, I'll focus on the snare drum. In the original, the snare is already present with a pattern like "Oo-o|-o--|O--o". I want to enhance it by adding more snare hits to give it more presence. Maybe adding soft hits (o) on off-beats to create a more dynamic rhythm.

Next, I need to incorporate the tom. Toms are usually used to add flavor and rhythm, especially on the "and" of beats. I'll add some soft tom hits (o) on beats 2 and 4 to complement the snare and kick. This will make the groove more layered and interesting.

I also notice that the ride cymbal (R) isn't used in the original. To add some texture, I'll introduce a subtle ride pattern using soft closed hits (x) on the bow. This will add movement without overpowering the other instruments.

Finally, I'll ensure that the crash cymbal (C) is still used sparingly to emphasize key points in the groove, maybe on beats 1 and 3.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust each line to reflect these changes, making sure the overall rhythm stays cohesive and balanced.
