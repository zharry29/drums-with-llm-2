Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove to include both ride and tom elements. Let me start by understanding the current groove and the edit request.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

From this, I can see that the kick drum (K) has a busy pattern with multiple hits, the snare drum (S) has hits on beats 2 and 4, crash cymbals (C) are hit on beat 1 of each bar, and there's no activity on the hihat (H), toms (T), or ride cymbal (R).

The edit request is to have "not only ride but also tom." So, I need to add both ride cymbal hits and tom hits to the groove.

First, I'll think about where to place the ride cymbal hits. Ride cymbals often play a steady rhythm, usually on off-beats or in a shuffle pattern. Since the current groove doesn't have any hihat activity, adding ride cymbals could add a nice rhythmic texture.

Next, for the toms, they are often used to add accents or fills. Since the groove is quite sparse on the toms, I'll need to decide where to place tom hits to enhance the rhythm without clashing with the kick and snare.

Looking at the kick drum pattern, it's quite active, so I'll need to ensure that the tom hits complement it without making the rhythm too busy. Maybe adding tom hits on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4 would work well.

For the ride cymbal, I'll opt for a steady 8th-note pattern. Since each beat consists of four 16th notes, I'll place ride hits on the second and fourth 16th notes of each beat. This will give a smooth, driving feel.

Now, I'll map out the changes:

- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Add 'X' on the second and fourth 16th notes of each beat to create a steady rhythm.
- **Toms (T):** Add 'O' on the "and" of beat 2 (third 16th note of the second beat) and the "and" of beat 4 (third 16th note of the fourth beat).

Let me visualize the updated groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|---O|----|---O  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: x---|x---|x---|x---

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. The ride cymbal (R) should have hits on the second and fourth 16th notes of each beat, which would be the second and fourth positions in each four-character beat. So, it should look like 'x-x-' for each beat.

Let me correct that:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|---O|----|---O  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-

Yes, that looks better. Now, the ride cymbal has a steady 'x-x-' pattern in each beat, and the toms have 'O's on the "and" of beats 2 and 4, adding some rhythmic interest without conflicting with the kick and snare.

I think this should fulfill the edit request by incorporating both ride and tom elements into the groove.
