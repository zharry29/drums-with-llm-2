Alright, so I need to add some snare to this drum groove. Let me first understand what's going on with the current groove. 

Looking at the Kick drum (K) line: O---|----|O---|----. So, the kick is on the first and third beats of each measure. That's a pretty standard backbeat, which is common in many genres. 

The Snare drum (S) line is currently: ----|O---|----|O---. So, the snare is on the second and fourth beats. That's also a typical backbeat pattern, but the user wants to add more snare to make the groove more interesting. 

The Hihat (H) line is: X---|X---|X---|X---. It looks like the hi-hat is playing steady eighth notes with a hard closed hit (X). That's a driving rhythm, but maybe adding some variety could help. 

The Tom (T) line is all ----, so no toms are being played. Maybe adding some tom hits could add flavor, but the user specifically asked to add snare, so I'll focus on that for now. 

The Crash cymbal (C) and Ride cymbal (R) lines are also all ----, so no cymbals are being used. Adding a crash on the first beat could give a nice accent, but again, the main focus is on adding snare.

Okay, so to add more snare, I could add hits on the off-beats or maybe add some ghost notes to give it a bit more texture. Ghost notes are softer hits that add rhythm without overpowering the main backbeat. 

Let's see, in the first measure, the snare is on the second and fourth beats. Maybe I can add a soft snare (o) on the first and third beats as ghost notes. That would give it a bit more movement. 

In the second measure, I could add some more snare hits on the off-beats. Maybe on the 'and' of beat 1 and the 'and' of beat 3. That would make the rhythm more intricate. 

I should also consider the articulation. Using a mix of hard (O) and soft (o) snare hits can add dynamics to the groove. Maybe use a hard hit on the backbeat and softer hits on the ghost notes. 

Let me sketch this out:

First measure:
S: o---|O---|o---|O---

Second measure:
S: o---|O---|o---|O---

This way, there are soft snare hits on the first and third beats, adding some texture without overpowering the main backbeat. 

I think this should make the groove more dynamic and interesting by adding more snare hits at different intensities.
