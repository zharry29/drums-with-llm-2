Okay, I need to edit the given drum groove to include both kick and tom. Let me look at the original groove first.

The original groove has:
- Kick (K) on beats 1 and 3 in the first and third bars.
- Snare (S) on beat 3 in the third bar.
- Hihat (H) is not played.
- Toms (T) are playing a steady "O-o-" pattern.
- Crash (C) and Ride (R) are not played.

The edit request is to have not only kick but also tom. So, I need to ensure that both kick and tom are present. The kick is already there, so I need to make sure the toms are also included.

Looking at the T line, it's already playing "O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-", which is good. Maybe I can emphasize the toms a bit more or add some variation.

I notice that the Hihat is not played in the original. Adding hihat would make the groove more dynamic. Let's add a steady hihat pattern.

Also, the crash and ride cymbals are not used. Since the edit doesn't mention cymbals, I'll focus on kick, snare, hihat, and toms.

So, I'll add a basic hihat pattern like "x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-". This will provide a steady rhythm.

I'll keep the kick and snare as they are and ensure the toms continue their pattern. I'll add the hihat to fill in the gaps.

Putting it all together, the new groove should have kick on beats 1 and 3, snare on beat 3, hihat on every offbeat, and toms playing their steady pattern.
