Alright, so I need to help edit a drum groove based on the user's request. The user provided a specific drum notation format, which I should follow closely. The original groove is:

@@@
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

The edit request is to modify this groove so that it includes both ride cymbal (R) and tom (T) hits. The user wants the groove to "have not only ride but also tom." 

First, I'll analyze the current groove to see where improvements can be made. Looking at the original, I notice that the ride cymbal (R) isn't being used at allâ€”it's all dashes. The tom (T) has a hit on the third beat of the third bar, but it's only a single 'O'. The crash cymbal (C) is heavily used, which might be making the groove feel a bit unbalanced.

To fulfill the request, I need to incorporate ride cymbal hits and add more tom hits. I should aim for a balanced mix where both R and T are present without overpowering the other elements.

Starting with the ride cymbal (R), I'll add some hits to give it presence. Maybe on beats 1 and 3 of each bar to start with. I'll use 'X' for a soft closed hit to keep it subtle.

Next, for the tom (T), I'll add more hits to complement the existing one. Perhaps on the off-beats or in a rhythmic pattern that adds interest. I'll use 'O' for hard hits to make them stand out.

I also notice that the crash cymbal (C) is used on every beat 1, which might be too dominant. I'll reduce its usage to allow the ride and tom to shine. Maybe keep it on the first beat of the first and third bars.

The kick drum (K) and snare drum (S) seem to have a good balance, so I'll leave them as they are unless adjustments are needed for the overall feel.

The hihat (H) has a steady rhythm, which is good. I'll keep that consistent.

Putting it all together, I'll draft the new groove with these changes:

- Add ride cymbal hits on beats 1 and 3 in each bar.
- Add more tom hits, perhaps on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4.
- Reduce crash cymbal hits to beats 1 of bars 1 and 3.
- Ensure the kick and snare remain balanced.

Let me visualize how this would look in the notation:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-  
S: ----|----|S---|----  
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-  
T: ----|---O|----|---O  
C: O---|----|O---|----  
R: X---|----|X---|----

This way, the ride cymbal is present but not overwhelming, and the toms add some rhythmic interest without clashing with the kick and snare.

I'll double-check to make sure all lines have 16 characters (excluding the |) and that the beats are properly divided by the |.

Finally, I'll ensure that the notation is correctly formatted between @@@ as per the user's instructions.
