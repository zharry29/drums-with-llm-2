Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both cymbals and snare. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

The user provided a drum groove with the following setup:

- **K:** O---|----|O---|---- (Kick drum)
- **S:** ----|O---|----|O--- (Snare drum)
- **H:** X---|X---|X---|X--- (Hihat)
- **T:** ----|----|----|---- (Toms)
- **C:** ----|----|----|---- (Crash cymbal)
- **R:** ----|----|----|---- (Ride cymbal)

The edit request is to have "not only cymbal but also snare." So, I need to ensure that both the cymbals (Crash and Ride) and the snare are included in the groove.

Looking at the original groove, the snare is already present on beats 2 and 4. The cymbals are not used at all. So, my task is to add cymbal hits while keeping the snare hits.

I should decide where to place the cymbal hits. Typically, crash cymbals are used on strong beats to add accentuation. Let's add crash cymbals on beats 1 and 3. For the ride cymbal, it's often used on off-beats or to add rhythm, so I'll add ride hits on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4.

So, the updated lines would be:

- **C:** O---|----|O---|---- (Crash on beats 1 and 3)
- **R:** ----|x---|----|x--- (Ride on the "and" of beats 2 and 4)

I'll keep the snare hits as they are since they're already in the groove.

Putting it all together, the final groove should look like this:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: ----|x---|----|x---

This way, both the cymbals and snare are included, fulfilling the edit request.
