Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both ride cymbal and snare drum. Let me first understand the original groove they provided.

Looking at the original groove, the kick drum is playing a steady pattern with soft hits on every other beat. The snare drum is using sidesticks on beats 2 and 4, which is a bit unconventional. The hihat is playing on beats 2 and 4 with soft closed hits, and the ride cymbal has a dynamic pattern with both soft and hard hits. The toms, crash cymbal, and other instruments are silent.

The user's request is to have a groove that includes both ride cymbal and snare drum. So, I need to ensure both are prominently featured. 

First, I'll look at the snare drum. In the original, it's using sidesticks ("X" and "x"), but the user might want traditional snare hits. I'll change the snare to hard hits ("O") on beats 2 and 4 for a more standard backbeat.

Next, the ride cymbal is already present with a good dynamic range, but I can enhance it by making it more consistent. I'll adjust it to play on every offbeat with a mix of soft and hard hits to add texture without overpowering the snare.

The kick drum is playing soft hits, which is fine, but I'll make it more consistent with hard hits ("O") on beats 1 and 3 to provide a solid foundation.

I'll keep the hihat as it is, playing soft closed hits on every offbeat to maintain a steady rhythm. The toms and crash cymbal can remain silent to keep the focus on the snare and ride.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust each instrument's pattern to ensure both snare and ride are prominent, while maintaining a balanced and dynamic rhythm section.

Here's the revised drum groove with both ride cymbal and snare drum prominently featured:

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: O---|X---|O---|X---
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Snare Drum (S):** Changed to hard hits ("O") on beats 1 and 3, and sidestick hits ("X") on beats 2 and 4, making it more prominent.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Maintained with a dynamic pattern alternating between soft ("x") and hard ("X") hits, complementing the snare and adding texture.
- **Kick Drum (K):** Kept with soft hits ("o") on every other beat to maintain a subtle foundation.
- **Hihat (H):** Kept with soft closed hits ("x") on beats 2 and 4, supporting the rhythm.
- **Toms (T) and Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept silent to focus on the snare and ride cymbal.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both ride cymbal and snare drum featured prominently.
