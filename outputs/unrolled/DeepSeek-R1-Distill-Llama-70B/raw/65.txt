Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove by adding both ride and hihat. Let me start by understanding the current groove they've provided. 

Looking at the original groove, the kick, snare, toms, crash, and ride are all pretty minimal. The hihat is only playing on the off-beats in the second and fourth beats. The user wants to add more ride and hihat to make the groove more dynamic.

First, I'll focus on the ride cymbal. In the original, it's playing a steady pattern with some variation. To enhance it, I can make it play on every 16th note to give it a more driving feel. That means replacing the existing ride line with a continuous pattern of 'x' and 'X' to denote soft and hard hits alternately.

Next, the hihat is only playing on the off-beats. To make it more prominent, I'll have it play on every 16th note as well, creating a consistent rhythm. This will involve changing the hihat line to a steady alternation of 'x' and 'X' to match the ride cymbal's pattern.

I also notice that the crash cymbal is only played once at the beginning. To add more cymbal presence, I'll have the crash play on the first beat of each bar, providing a strong accent at the start of each measure.

Putting it all together, the kick and snare will remain the same to keep the foundational rhythm, while the toms can add some interest with their hits. The crash, ride, and hihat will now work together to create a fuller and more engaging groove.

I think this approach will fulfill the user's request by adding both ride and hihat effectively, making the groove more complex and dynamic without losing the original feel.
