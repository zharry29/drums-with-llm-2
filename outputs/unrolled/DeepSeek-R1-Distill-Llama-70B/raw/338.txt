Okay, so the user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing the hihat and tom hits. Let me start by understanding the original groove.

Looking at the original groove, I see that the kick drum (K) has a pattern with both hard and soft hits. The snare drum (S) has a backbeat on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits. The hihat (H) is playing a steady rhythm with soft and hard hits, and the crash cymbal (C) is accenting the first beat of each measure. The ride cymbal (R) is not playing in this groove.

The user's edit request is to remove any hihat or tom hits. Since the tom (T) is already silent in this groove, I only need to focus on removing the hihat (H) hits. 

I'll go through each instrument line and ensure that the hihat is silenced. That means setting all characters in the hihat line to "-", indicating no hits. I'll leave the kick, snare, and crash cymbal as they are to maintain the foundational rhythm and accents.

After making these changes, I'll review the groove to ensure that the hihat is completely removed and that the other instruments still provide a balanced rhythm. This should result in a groove that focuses on the kick, snare, and crash cymbal without any hihat or tom hits.

K: O---|---o|O-O-|---- 
S: ----|O---|----|O--- 
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Kick Drum (K):** Maintained the original pattern to provide a solid foundation.
2. **Snare Drum (S):** Kept the backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O").
3. **Hihat (H):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".
4. **Toms (T):** Kept silent as per the original groove.
5. **Crash Cymbal (C):** Maintained the accent on the first beat for added emphasis.
6. **Ride Cymbal (R):** Kept silent to avoid adding unnecessary texture.

This arrangement creates a rhythm focused on the kick, snare, and crash cymbal without any hihat or tom hits.
