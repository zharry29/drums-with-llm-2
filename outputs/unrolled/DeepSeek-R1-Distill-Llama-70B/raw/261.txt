Okay, so I need to edit the given drum groove to include both cymbals and hihats. Let me first look at the original groove provided.

The original groove has K, S, H, T, C, R. The H line is all dashes, meaning the hihats aren't being used. The user wants to add hihats while keeping the cymbals. 

I should think about where to place the hihats. Typically, hihats are played on offbeats or to add rhythm. Maybe I can add them on the offbeats in each beat. Let's see, each beat has four 16th notes, so the offbeats would be the second and fourth notes in each beat.

Looking at the H line, it's all dashes. I'll replace some of those with 'x' or 'o' to denote soft closed hits. Maybe start with 'x' on the second note of each beat. So each beat would have 'x' on the second note, making the H line look like x---|x---|x---|x---.

Wait, but the user also mentioned cymbals. The original has a crash on the first note of the first beat. I should keep that. Maybe add a ride cymbal on the last note of the last beat to give it some movement. So the R line would have an 'O' on the last note.

Let me check each instrument:

K: The kick is on beats 1, 2, and 4. I'll keep that as is.

S: The snare is on beat 3. That's good, maybe add a soft hit on beat 4's second note for some flavor.

H: Adding 'x's on the second note of each beat to create a steady rhythm.

T: The toms have a pattern, but maybe simplify it to just the first note of each beat with 'O's for consistency.

C: Keep the crash on the first note of the first beat.

R: Add a soft hit on the last note of the last beat for a subtle ending.

Putting it all together, I think this will balance both cymbals and hihats without overcrowding the groove.

I'll add hihat patterns while keeping the cymbal elements. I'll use soft closed hihat hits (x) on offbeats to create a rhythmic foundation while maintaining the crash and ride cymbal elements.
