Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both hihat and tom. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided. 

Looking at the original groove, the hihat is already present with a steady rhythm, which is good. The tom is missing, so I need to add that in. 

I'll start by analyzing each instrument line. The hihat (H) is already playing a steady 16th-note rhythm with a mix of open and closed hits. I should keep that as it is to maintain the groove.

Next, I'll look at the tom (T). Since the user wants the groove to have not only hihat but also tom, I'll need to add some hits on the tom. I'll choose the 5th and 13th notes to add a tom hit, using 'O' for a hard hit. This will add some accents without overpowering the existing hihat rhythm.

I'll make sure the tom hits are placed in a way that complements the overall rhythm without clashing with the hihat or other instruments. 

Finally, I'll ensure that the rest of the instruments (K, S, C, R) remain unchanged unless necessary. In this case, they seem fine, so I'll leave them as they are.

Putting it all together, I'll update the tom line with the new hits and keep everything else consistent. This should fulfill the user's request to have both hihat and tom in the groove.
