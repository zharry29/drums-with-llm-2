Alright, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both hihat and tom. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, I'll look at the original drum groove they provided. It seems like the hihat is already present but not very active, and the tom is missing. The user wants to enhance the groove by adding more hihat activity and incorporating the tom.

I'll start by analyzing each instrument's current pattern. The kick drum (K) has a solid foundation, the snare (S) has some hits, but the hihat (H) is either missing or not prominent. The tom (T) is completely absent, which is what the user wants to fix.

Next, I'll think about how to add the hihat. Hihat usually provides a rhythmic foundation, so I'll consider adding it in a steady 16th-note pattern, alternating between open and closed hits for variety. This will make the groove feel more dynamic.

Then, I'll focus on the tom. Toms are often used to add flavor and rhythm, especially on the off-beats. I'll decide where to place the tom hits to complement the kick and snare without clashing. Maybe adding a soft hit (o) on the 8th and 12th notes in the third beat would work well.

I'll also ensure that the crash cymbal (C) and ride cymbal (R) are appropriately placed to enhance the overall sound without overpowering the new additions.

Finally, I'll put it all together, making sure each instrument's pattern aligns and creates a cohesive groove. I'll double-check that the hihat is now more prominent and the tom is integrated smoothly.
