Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both cymbal and snare. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

The original groove has:
- Kick (K) on beats 1 and 3
- Snare (S) on beat 3
- Toms (T) on every beat
- No Crash (C) or Ride (R) hits

The user wants to add cymbal hits. From the previous interactions, it seems they want both crash and ride cymbals, but the edit request specifically mentions "cymbal," so I'll include both to cover all bases.

I'll add crash cymbals on beats 1 and 3 for accentuation and ride cymbals on the offbeats to add rhythm. I'll also ensure the snare is present on beats 2 and 4 to complement the kick and toms.

Looking at the notation, I'll place 'O' for crash on beats 1 and 3 in the C line and 'X' for ride on the offbeats in the R line. I'll keep the snare hits on beats 2 and 4 as 'O' in the S line.

I'll make sure the changes fit within the 16th note structure and that the articulations make sense for each instrument. Finally, I'll format the new groove correctly, ensuring each instrument's line is updated as needed.
