Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove by adding both cymbal and ride elements. Let me start by understanding the current groove they provided. 

Looking at their drum notation:

- **K:** `----|----|----|----` - The kick drum isn't being used at all. That's interesting because usually, the kick provides the foundation in most genres.
- **S:** `----|----|----|----` - The snare is also not used. This makes the groove very minimalistic, maybe too much so.
- **H:** `----|x---|----|x---` - The hihat is being played on the 2nd and 4th beats of each measure, but it's using 'x' which indicates a soft closed hit. It's a bit subtle.
- **T:** `----|----|----|----` - Toms are completely absent.
- **C:** `----|----|----|----` - Crash cymbal isn't used either.
- **R:** `x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-` - The ride cymbal is being used extensively, which is good, but it's missing the crash cymbal hits that could add accents.

The user's edit request is to make sure the groove has not only cymbal (I assume they mean crash cymbal) but also ride. So, I need to add crash cymbal hits and ensure the ride is well-integrated.

First, I'll add crash cymbals. Crash cymbals are usually used on the first beat of a measure to mark the beginning and add a bright, sharp sound. So, I'll place an 'O' on the crash cymbal line at the start of each measure.

Next, the ride cymbal is already present, but I can make it more dynamic by varying between open and closed hits. Using 'X' for hard closed hits and 'x' for soft closed hits can add texture. Maybe alternate between them to create a more interesting rhythm.

The hihat is currently using soft closed hits. To make it more driving, I can switch to hard open hits ('O') on the off-beats. This will give the groove more forward motion and make the rhythm more engaging.

I notice the kick and snare are not used. Adding a subtle kick on beats 1 and 3 can provide a better foundation without overpowering the other elements. For the snare, adding a soft hit on beats 2 and 4 can add some movement and make the groove feel more complete.

Toms aren't necessary for this groove, so I'll leave them out to keep it simple.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust each line to incorporate these changes, ensuring that the crash cymbal, ride, hihat, kick, and snare all work together harmoniously.
