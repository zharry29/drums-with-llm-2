Alright, I need to help the user add both kick and hihat to their drum groove. Let me start by understanding the current groove they provided. 

Looking at the groove, I see that the kick drum (K) isn't being used at all, which is unusual for most songs as the kick typically provides the foundational beat. The snare drum (S) is also not used, which is a bit surprising. The hihat (H) is being used minimally, with only a few notes, and the toms (T) aren't used either. The crash (C) and ride (R) cymbals are also not present, which means the groove is quite sparse.

The user's edit request is to add both kick and hihat to the groove. So, my goal is to enhance the groove by incorporating these elements without changing the existing structure too much. 

First, I'll focus on the kick drum. In most genres, the kick drum is on beats 1 and 3, providing a solid foundation. I'll add 'O' on those beats to represent hard hits. Next, the hihat should be more active to add rhythm and drive. I'll use 'x' to indicate soft closed hits on the off-beats to create a smoother rhythm.

I'll go through each beat and add the kick on beats 1 and 3, and fill in the hihat with closed hits on the off-beats. This should make the groove more dynamic and give it a better structure.

After making these changes, I'll review the updated groove to ensure it flows well and meets the user's request. I'll make sure that the notation is correct and that each character aligns with the appropriate instrument and articulation.

Finally, I'll present the updated groove, ensuring it's formatted correctly within the @@@ symbols as specified. This should fulfill the user's request by adding both kick and hihat to the groove, making it more complete and engaging.
