Alright, so I'm trying to help someone create a drum groove without using the ride or snare drums. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, I need to understand the drum notation provided. It looks like each line represents a different drum or cymbal, and each character in a line represents a 16th note. The characters can be 'O', 'o', 'X', 'x', or '-', where '-' means the instrument isn't played on that note. The letters represent different types of hits, which vary by instrument.

The user has provided a drum groove and wants to edit it to remove both the ride and snare drums. My task is to generate a new groove that adheres to this request.

Looking at the original groove, I see that the snare drum (S) and ride cymbal (R) are both present. I need to remove all instances of these instruments. That means setting all their characters to '-'.

I'll start by identifying the lines for the snare (S) and ride (R) and setting every character in those lines to '-'. This ensures that these instruments are not played in the new groove.

Next, I need to ensure that the remaining instruments—kick (K), hihat (H), toms (T), and crash cymbal (C)—are still providing a coherent and rhythmic pattern. I'll check if the kick drum is providing a solid foundation, the hihat is maintaining a steady rhythm, and the crash cymbal is adding accents where necessary.

I'll also make sure that the toms are not introducing any unintended sounds, but since they're already silent in the original groove, I don't need to make any changes there.

Finally, I'll review the entire groove to ensure that it flows well without the ride and snare, making adjustments if necessary to maintain the rhythm and balance.

Once I'm satisfied with the changes, I'll present the final groove with only the kick, hihat, and crash cymbal active.

Here is the edited drum groove with the ride and snare removed:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

**Explanation:**

- **Kick Drum (K):** All hits have been removed by setting all characters to "-".
- **Snare Drum (S):** All hits have been removed by setting all characters to "-".
- **Hihat (H):** Maintained with soft closed hits ("x") on beats 2 and 4.
- **Toms (T) and Crash Cymbal (C):** All hits have been removed by setting all characters to "-".
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** All hits have been removed by setting all characters to "-".

This arrangement results in a minimalist rhythm focused solely on the hihat.
