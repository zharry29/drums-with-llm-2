Okay, so I need to help the user edit a drum groove to include both hihat and ride cymbal. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided.

Looking at the original groove, I see that the hihat is already present but the ride cymbal isn't. The user wants both to be included. So, my goal is to add ride cymbal hits while keeping the hihat pattern intact.

First, I'll look at each instrument's part:

- **Kick Drum (K):** It's not specified, so I'll assume it's already okay.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Also not specified, so I'll leave it as is.
- **Hihat (H):** It's already present with soft closed hits on beats 2 and 4.
- **Toms (T):** Not mentioned, so I'll keep it silent.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Not needed here, so I'll leave it out.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** This is what I need to add.

I'll add ride cymbal hits on the offbeats to complement the hihat. Using a mix of soft and hard hits will add texture without overpowering the hihat. I'll make sure the ride cymbal pattern is steady and rhythmic, enhancing the overall groove.

Finally, I'll ensure that both the hihat and ride cymbal are clearly represented in the notation, making the groove dynamic and balanced.

Here's the revised drum groove with both hihat and ride cymbal prominently featured:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
R: x-X-x|X-x-X|x-X-x|X-x-X
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Hihat (H):** Maintains soft closed hits ("x") on beats 2 and 4, providing a steady rhythm.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with a dynamic pattern alternating between soft ("x") and hard ("X") closed hits, adding texture and interest.
- **Kick Drum (K), Snare Drum (S), Toms (T), and Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept silent to focus on the hihat and ride cymbal.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both hihat and ride cymbal featured prominently.
