Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both snare and hihat. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

Looking at the original groove, I see that the kick (K), snare (S), hihat (H), toms (T), crash cymbal (C), and ride cymbal (R) are all set to '-' except for the ride cymbal, which has a specific pattern. The user wants to add snare and hihat to this groove.

First, I'll focus on adding the snare drum hits. In a typical groove, the snare usually plays on beats 2 and 4, often referred to as the "backbeat." So, I'll place 'S' on the 5th and 13th positions of the snare line.

Next, for the hihat, it's common to have a steady rhythm, often playing on every 8th note. I'll alternate between 'X' (closed hit) and 'x' (open hit) to create a dynamic rhythm. This means placing 'X' on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, and 15th positions.

I'll make sure not to disrupt the existing ride cymbal pattern, keeping it as is. The rest of the instruments like kick, toms, and crash cymbals can remain unchanged unless specified.

Putting it all together, I'll update the snare and hihat lines accordingly, ensuring the new hits are correctly placed within the 16th note structure.
