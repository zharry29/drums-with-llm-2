Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both kick and ride cymbal. Let's see what they have and what they need.

First, looking at the original groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user wants to add ride cymbal hits. The ride cymbal is usually played with a steady rhythm, often on the 'and' of beats or in a shuffle pattern. Since the kick is already present on beats 1 and 3, adding ride on the off-beats could complement it well.

I notice the hihat and crash cymbal lines are empty or minimal. Adding ride cymbal hits here will fill out the rhythm section. I'll place 'X' in the ride line to indicate closed hits, which are softer and suitable for a steady rhythm.

So, the final groove would look like:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: X---|X---|X---|X---

This adds a steady ride rhythm without overpowering the existing kick and snare hits. It keeps the groove balanced and adds the requested ride cymbal.
