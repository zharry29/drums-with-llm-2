Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove by removing any snare or cymbal hits. Let me first understand the problem and the requirements.

The user provided a drum groove with the following instruments: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash Cymbal (C), and Ride Cymbal (R). The current groove is:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

The edit request is to remove any snare or cymbal hits. That means I need to eliminate all hits from the Snare drum (S), Crash Cymbal (C), and Ride Cymbal (R). The user wants only the Kick drum (K), Hihat (H), and Toms (T) to remain, but since Toms are already silent, they'll stay as they are.

First, I'll look at each line and see what needs to be changed.

1. **Kick Drum (K):** The user hasn't mentioned any changes to the kick, so I'll leave it as is.
   - Current: `O---|---o|O-O-|----`
   
2. **Snare Drum (S):** All hits need to be removed. In the current groove, S has `----|O---|----|O---`. I'll set all characters to `-` to remove the snare hits.
   - To change: `----|----|----|----`

3. **Hihat (H):** The user hasn't mentioned removing the hihat, so I'll leave it as is.
   - Current: `--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`

4. **Toms (T):** Already silent, so no changes needed.
   - Current: `----|----|----|----`

5. **Crash Cymbal (C):** All hits need to be removed. Currently, C has `O---|----|----|----`. I'll set all characters to `-`.
   - To change: `----|----|----|----`

6. **Ride Cymbal (R):** All hits need to be removed. Currently, R has `----|----|----|----`, so it's already silent.

After making these changes, the updated groove will have the snare and cymbal lines silenced.

I should also ensure that the formatting remains correct, with each line properly aligned and separated by `|`.

So, the final groove should look like this:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

I need to make sure that I've correctly replaced the S and C lines with all `-` to remove any hits. The rest of the instruments should remain unchanged.

Double-checking the changes:
- **Snare Drum (S):** All hits removed.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** All hits removed.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Already silent.

Yes, that looks correct. This edited groove now excludes any snare and cymbal hits, focusing solely on the kick and hihat.

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This groove now features:
- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern to provide a solid foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".
- **Hihat (H):** Maintained its dynamic pattern with soft and hard hits.
- **Toms (T):** Kept silent as per the original groove.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Kept silent as per the original groove.

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focused on the kick and hihat without any snare or cymbal hits.
