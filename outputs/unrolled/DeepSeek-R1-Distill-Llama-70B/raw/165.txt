Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a drum groove and an edit request. The goal is to modify the given drum groove so that it includes both kick and snare, ensuring that both instruments are prominent in the rhythm.

First, I'll start by understanding the drum notation provided. Each line represents a different drum or cymbal, and each character corresponds to a 16th note. The characters can be 'O', 'o', 'X', 'x', or '-', where '-' indicates no note is played. The specific meanings of 'O', 'o', 'X', and 'x' vary depending on the instrument, but generally, uppercase letters denote harder hits, and lowercase denote softer hits or different articulations.

The given drum groove is as follows:

```
K: OOO-|---O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

From this, I can see that the kick drum (K) has a busy pattern with multiple hits in the first and third beats, the snare drum (S) has hits on the second and fourth beats, the crash cymbal (C) is played on the first beat of each measure, and the hihat (H), toms (T), and ride cymbal (R) are not played in this groove.

The edit request is to ensure that the groove has "not only kick but also snare." This means that while the kick drum is already prominent, the snare drum should also have a noticeable presence in the rhythm. Currently, the snare is only played on beats 2 and 4, which is standard in many drum grooves, but perhaps the user wants a more balanced or interactive rhythm between the kick and snare.

To achieve this, I'll consider enhancing the snare drum's role without overpowering the kick drum. One approach is to add additional snare hits that complement the kick drum pattern. For example, adding snare hits on off-beats or syncopated rhythms can create a more dynamic interplay between the two instruments.

I'll also ensure that the overall rhythm remains cohesive and doesn't become too cluttered. It's important to maintain a clear pulse and ensure that the added snare hits enhance the groove rather than making it sound busy or disjointed.

Now, I'll proceed to modify the drum groove accordingly, ensuring that both the kick and snare are prominent and work well together.
