Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both hihat and cymbal. Let's start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

First, looking at the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** O--O|----|--O-|---- (Plays on beats 1, 2, and 4)
- **Snare (S):** ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o (Plays on beats 2 and 4 with some syncopation)
- **Hihat (H):** ----|----|----|---- (No hihat)
- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|---- (No toms)
- **Crash (C):** ----|----|----|---- (No crash)
- **Ride (R):** o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O- (Ride is playing a steady pattern)

The user wants the groove to have not only hihat but also cymbal. So, I need to add hihat and cymbal hits.

1. **Hihat (H):** Currently, there's no hihat. I'll add a steady 16th-note pattern using 'x' for soft closed hits. So, something like x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-.

2. **Crash Cymbal (C):** The crash cymbal is currently not used. I'll add crash hits on beats 1 and 3. So, O---|----|O---|----.

3. **Ride Cymbal (R):** The ride is already playing, but to incorporate the cymbal better, I might adjust it to complement the crash. Maybe change it to x---|X-x-|x---|X-x- to include both soft and hard hits.

4. **Kick and Snare:** I'll keep the kick and snare as they are since they form the foundation.

Putting it all together:

- **K:** O--O|----|--O-|----
- **S:** ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- **H:** x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
- **T:** ----|----|----|----
- **C:** O---|----|O---|----
- **R:** x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

I think this adds the necessary hihat and cymbal elements while keeping the original feel intact.
