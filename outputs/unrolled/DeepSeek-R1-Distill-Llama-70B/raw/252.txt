Okay, so I need to edit the given drum groove to include both kick and ride. Let me look at the original groove first.

The kick drum (K) is already present, so I need to make sure the ride cymbal (R) is added. Looking at the original, the ride is not used at all. I should add some ride hits to complement the kick.

I'll go through each beat and decide where to place the ride hits. Maybe on the off-beats to add some rhythm. I'll use 'X' for the ride hits since that's the hard closed hit. 

I'll also check if the kick drum pattern can be adjusted to work better with the ride, but it seems fine as it is. So, I'll leave the kick as is and add the ride in the spaces where it makes sense.

Finally, I'll make sure the notation is correct, with each instrument's line updated accordingly.
