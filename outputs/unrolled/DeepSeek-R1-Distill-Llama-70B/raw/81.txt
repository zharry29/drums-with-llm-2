Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove to include both cymbals and toms. Let me first look at the given groove to understand what's already there. 

The current groove is:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

From this, I can see that the kick (K) has a solid pattern, the snare (S) has a hit on the third beat, the hihat (H) is playing steady 16th notes, the toms (T) have a hit on the third beat of the third bar, and the crash cymbal (C) is played on the first beat of each bar. The ride cymbal (R) isn't being used here.

The edit request is to have not only cymbals but also toms. Since the cymbals (both crash and ride) are already present, I need to enhance the tom hits to make them more prominent or add more hits. 

Looking at the T line, there's only one 'O' on the third beat of the third bar. To add more tom hits, I can add hits on other beats, maybe on the off-beats or in a rhythmic pattern that complements the kick and snare. 

I'll go through each bar and see where I can add tom hits without clashing with the existing patterns. Maybe adding a hit on the 'e' of beat 2 in the first bar, and similarly in other bars to create a consistent tom pattern.

After adding the tom hits, I'll make sure the cymbals are still present and perhaps adjust their pattern slightly if needed. I'll ensure that the overall groove remains balanced and that the toms add depth without overpowering the other elements.

Finally, I'll format the new groove correctly, ensuring that each line has 16 characters (excluding the |) and that the articulations are correct based on the notation rules provided.
