Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both snare and cymbals. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided. 

Looking at the original groove, the snare drum is already present on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O"), which is good. However, there are no cymbals in the original pattern. The user wants to add cymbals to the groove, so I need to decide where to place them.

I'll start by considering where cymbals can be added to enhance the rhythm without making it too busy. Typically, crash cymbals are used on accents, often on the first beat of a measure or on key hits. Ride cymbals can be played on offbeats to add texture.

I'll add crash cymbals on the first beat of each measure to give the groove a strong accent. For the ride cymbal, I'll add it on the offbeats with a mix of soft and hard hits to create interest.

I'll also make sure the snare drum remains prominent on beats 2 and 4. The kick drum and toms can stay as they are to keep the foundation solid. 

Finally, I'll review the changes to ensure the groove is balanced and dynamic, with both snare and cymbals featured prominently.

Here's the final drum groove with both snare and cymbals prominently featured:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: x---|X---|x---|X---
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Added hard hits ("O") on beats 1 and 3 to add strong accents and fulfill the cymbal requirement.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Maintained its backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O").
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with a dynamic pattern alternating between soft ("x") and hard ("X") hits, complementing the crash cymbal.
- **Kick Drum (K):** Kept unchanged to provide a solid foundation on beats 1 and 3.
- **Hihat (H):** Added soft closed hits ("x") on every offbeat to provide a steady rhythm.
- **Toms (T):** Kept silent to avoid overcrowding the groove.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and cymbals featured prominently.
