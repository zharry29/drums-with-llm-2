Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both kick and ride. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided. 

Looking at the original, the kick (K) has a solid pattern, but the ride (R) is already present with a specific rhythm. The user wants to ensure that both kick and ride are included, so I need to make sure both are clearly represented.

I notice that the kick is already well-defined, so I'll keep that. The ride is there, but maybe I can enhance its presence to make it more prominent. I'll check the notation for ride hits, which can be O, o, X, or x. Since the user didn't specify, I'll stick with the existing ride pattern but ensure it's consistent.

I'll go through each line and make sure that both kick and ride have their parts without clashing. I'll keep the snare and hihat as they are since the edit request is about kick and ride. 

After reviewing, I'll adjust the ride line to make sure it's clear and complements the kick drum. I'll ensure that the final notation is correct and balanced, showing both instruments effectively.
