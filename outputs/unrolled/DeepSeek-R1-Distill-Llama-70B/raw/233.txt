Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both kick and tom. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided.

Looking at the original groove, the kick drum (K) is already present and active, which is good because the edit request is to ensure it's there. The snare drum (S) is also present, but the user specifically wants to make sure the kick and tom are both included.

First, I'll check the tom (T) line. In the original, the toms are mostly inactive except for the last beat of the fourth bar. To meet the request, I need to add more tom hits. I'll think about where to place them to make the groove balanced without clashing with the kick.

I notice that the kick is on beats 1 and 3, so adding toms on beats 2 and 4 could complement it well. I'll use 'O' for hard hits on the toms to keep it consistent with the kick.

Next, I'll update the tom line to include these hits. I'll make sure not to overload any beats where the kick is already playing to avoid muddying the sound. 

Finally, I'll review the entire groove to ensure that both the kick and tom are present and work well together. I'll also check that the other instruments (snare, hihat, crash, ride) are still playing their parts correctly without any unintended changes.

Once I'm satisfied with the changes, I'll present the updated groove with both kick and tom included as requested.
