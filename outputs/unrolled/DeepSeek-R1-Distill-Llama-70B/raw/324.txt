Alright, so I need to help the user modify their drum groove by removing both the ride and snare drums. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided. 

Looking at the original notation, I see that the kick drum (K) has a pattern like "O--O|----|--O-|----", which means it's hitting on beats 1 and 3 with a soft hit on beat 2. The snare drum (S) has a more complex pattern with "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o", indicating a mix of hard hits, soft open hits, and sidesticks. The hihat (H) is pretty busy with "X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-", suggesting a dynamic rhythm with both hard and soft closed hits. The toms (T) are silent, the crash cymbal (C) is also silent, and the ride cymbal (R) is completely absent.

The user's edit request is to remove both the ride and snare drums from this groove. So, my first thought is to eliminate the snare drum's line entirely and ensure the ride cymbal remains silent. 

I'll start by removing the snare drum hits. In the original groove, the snare is quite active, so removing it will significantly change the feel of the groove. I'll set all the snare's characters to "-", indicating no hits. 

Next, I'll ensure that the ride cymbal remains silent. Since it was already absent in the original groove, I'll leave it as is, with all characters set to "-".

Now, I need to focus on the remaining instruments: kick drum, hihat, toms, and crash cymbal. The kick drum's pattern seems to be the foundation, so I'll keep it as "O--O|----|--O-|----" to maintain the rhythmic base. 

The hihat is quite active, which is good because it can take over some of the rhythmic responsibilities now that the snare is removed. I'll keep its pattern as "X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-".

The toms (T) are silent in the original groove, so I'll leave them as "-".

The crash cymbal (C) is also silent, so I'll leave it as "-".

Finally, the ride cymbal (R) will remain silent, so I'll set all its characters to "-".

Putting it all together, the revised groove will have the kick drum and hihat providing the rhythm, with the snare and ride cymbals completely removed. This should meet the user's request of having no ride or snare in the groove.

I also need to ensure that the final notation is correctly formatted and only includes the necessary instruments. I'll double-check each line to confirm that the snare and ride cymbals are silent and that the remaining instruments are accurately represented.

After making these changes, I'll review the groove to ensure it flows well and meets the user's requirements. It's important that the groove remains balanced and dynamic even without the snare and ride cymbals, so the kick and hihat will need to carry the rhythm effectively.

Overall, the key steps are:
1. Remove all snare drum hits by setting them to "-".
2. Ensure the ride cymbal remains silent by setting all its characters to "-".
3. Keep the kick drum and hihat patterns to maintain the rhythmic foundation.
4. Verify that the toms and crash cymbal are silent as per the original groove.
5. Review the final notation for accuracy and flow.

By following these steps, I can create a drum groove that aligns with the user's request of having no ride or snare drums.

Here's the revised drum groove with both ride and snare drums removed:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

1. **Kick Drum (K):** Maintained the original pattern to provide a solid foundation.
2. **Snare Drum (S):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-", eliminating its presence.
3. **Hihat (H):** Kept the dynamic pattern with hard and soft closed hits to maintain rhythm.
4. **Toms (T), Crash Cymbal (C), and Ride Cymbal (R):** All kept silent as per the edit request.

This arrangement focuses solely on the kick drum and hihat, creating a minimalist rhythm without snare or ride cymbals.
