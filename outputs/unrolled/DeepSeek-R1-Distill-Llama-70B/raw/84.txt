Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both cymbal and tom. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided. 

Looking at the drum notation, each line represents a different drum or cymbal. The user wants to add more cymbal and tom hits. 

First, I'll check the Cymbal (C) and Tom (T) lines in the original groove. The Cymbal line already has hits, but I can make it more prominent by adding more hits. The Tom line is empty, so I'll need to add some hits there to give it a stronger presence.

I'll go through each beat and decide where to place the cymbal and tom hits. For the cymbal, I'll add hits on the off-beats to make it more dynamic. For the tom, I'll add hits on beats 2 and 4 to create a solid rhythm section.

I'll make sure not to overwrite the existing kick (K) and snare (S) hits, as they are crucial for the groove. Instead, I'll enhance the cymbal and tom lines to complement them.

Finally, I'll review the changes to ensure the groove flows well and meets the user's request of having both cymbal and tom elements.
