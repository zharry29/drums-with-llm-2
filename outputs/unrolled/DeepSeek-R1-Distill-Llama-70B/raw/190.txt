Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both tom and snare. Let's see what the original groove looks like.

The original groove has:
- Kick drum (K) on beats 1 and 3
- Snare drum (S) on beats 2 and 4
- Hihat (H) playing on every 16th note
- No toms (T) or crash cymbal (C)
- No ride cymbal (R)

The user wants to add both tom and snare. Wait, the snare is already present on beats 2 and 4. Maybe they want to enhance the snare or add more snare hits. But the main request is to add toms.

Looking at the current T line, it's all dashes, so no toms are played. I need to add some tom hits. Toms are often used to add flavor and rhythm, so I'll add them on off-beats or syncopated rhythms.

I'll add a soft hit (o) on the "and" of beat 2 and a hard hit (O) on the "and" of beat 4 to give it some variation and interest.

So, the T line becomes: ----|---o|----|---O

I'll keep the rest of the groove the same since the snare is already present and the user didn't specify any other changes.
