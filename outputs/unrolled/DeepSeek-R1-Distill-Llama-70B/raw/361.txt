Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to remove any cymbal or ride cymbal hits. Let me look at the original groove they provided.

The original groove has the following instruments:
- **Kick Drum (K):** O--O|----|--O-|----
- **Snare Drum (S):** ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- **Hihat (H):** ----|----|----|----
- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** ----|----|----|----
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

The user wants to remove any cymbal or ride. So, I need to make sure that both the Crash Cymbal (C) and Ride Cymbal (R) are removed. 

First, I'll look at the Ride Cymbal (R) line: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-. To remove the ride, I'll set all its characters to "-".

Next, the Crash Cymbal (C) is already set to "----|----|----|----", so it's already removed. 

Now, I'll keep the Kick Drum (K), Snare Drum (S), Hihat (H), and Toms (T) as they are since the user didn't ask to remove them.

So, the edited groove will be:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I'll make sure to only include the final groove in the specified format.

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This groove now features:
- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern to provide a solid foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Maintains its dynamic pattern with "O", "o", and "X".
- **Hihat (H):** Kept silent as per the original groove.
- **Toms (T):** Kept silent as per the original groove.
- **Crash Cymbal (C) and Ride Cymbal (R):** Both removed by setting all characters to "-".

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focused on the kick and snare drum without any cymbal or ride hits.
