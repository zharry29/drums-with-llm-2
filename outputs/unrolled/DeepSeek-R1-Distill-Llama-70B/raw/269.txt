Alright, so I'm trying to help this user edit their drum groove. The main request is to have not only cymbals but also hihats in the groove. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, I look at the drum notation they provided. It seems like each line represents a different drum or cymbal, and each character represents a 16th note. Beats are separated by |, and there are four beats per measure. The characters can be O, o, X, x, or -, with specific meanings for each instrument.

The user provided their current groove, and they want to add hihats to it. The hihat line in their current groove is all x-x-x-x-, which means it's playing soft closed hits on every 16th note. That's a steady rhythm, but maybe it's too busy or doesn't leave room for the cymbals to shine.

Looking at the cymbal lines, the crash cymbal (C) is already being used on the first beat of each measure, which is good. The ride cymbal (R) isn't being used at all in the current groove. The user wants to incorporate both cymbals and hihats, so I need to make sure both are present and complement each other.

I think the first step is to simplify the hihat pattern so it's not playing on every single 16th note. Maybe have it play on the offbeats or in a more syncopated rhythm to leave space for the cymbals. That way, the groove feels more balanced and not too cluttered.

Next, I'll look at the kick drum (K) and snare drum (S) patterns. The kick is playing on beats 1 and 3, which is pretty standard. The snare is playing on beat 2 and near the end of beat 4, which gives a nice backbeat. I don't think I need to change these, as they provide a solid foundation.

For the toms (T), they're only playing a soft hit near the end of beat 4. That's fine, but maybe adding a few more tom hits could add some flavor. However, the main focus is on adding hihats and cymbals, so I'll keep the toms minimal.

Now, for the hihats. Instead of playing every 16th note, I'll have them play on the offbeats (the 'and' of beat 1, the 'and' of beat 3, etc.). This creates a more dynamic rhythm without overpowering the other instruments. I'll use soft closed hits (x) for a subtle sound.

For the cymbals, I'll keep the crash cymbal (C) on the first beat of each measure for a strong accent. Then, I'll add the ride cymbal (R) on the offbeats to complement the hihats. Using a mix of hard and soft hits on the ride will add texture without being too overwhelming.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust the hihat line to play on the offbeats, keep the kick and snare as they are, add some minimal tom hits for flavor, and incorporate both crash and ride cymbals to meet the user's request.

I also need to make sure that the final notation is correct, with each instrument's line properly formatted and only the final groove enclosed within @@@. No markdown or extra text should be included in the final answer.

After making these adjustments, I'll review the groove to ensure it flows well and meets the user's specifications. Once satisfied, I'll present the final groove as per the instructions.
