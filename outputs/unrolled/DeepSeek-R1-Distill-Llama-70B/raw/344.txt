Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove by removing the snare and cymbal parts. Let me start by understanding the notation and the current groove.

The drum notation has lines for each instrument: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash Cymbal (C), and Ride Cymbal (R). Each character represents a 16th note, and a '-' means the instrument isn't played. When a character is present, it indicates the type of hit, like 'O' for a hard hit or 'o' for a soft hit.

Looking at the user's drum groove, I see that the snare (S) and crash cymbal (C) are active. The snare has a mix of 'O' and 'o', and the crash cymbal has 'O's on the first beat of each measure. The ride cymbal isn't present, but the hihat (H) and toms (T) are. However, the user wants to remove any snare or cymbal hits, so I need to focus on that.

First, I'll look at the snare drum line. It's currently set to "----|----|S---|----", which means it's not playing on beats 1, 2, and 4, but has an 'S' on beat 3. To remove the snare, I'll set all characters to '-'.

Next, the crash cymbal (C) is set to "O---|O---|O---|O---", meaning it plays a hard hit on the first beat of each measure. To remove the cymbal, I'll set all characters to '-'.

I'll leave the kick drum (K) as it is since it's not part of the edit request. The hihat (H) and toms (T) are already set to their patterns, but since the user didn't mention them, I'll keep them unchanged.

So, the final groove will have the kick drum, hihat, and toms, but no snare or cymbals. This should fulfill the user's request for a groove without snare or cymbal hits.

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|----|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This groove now features:
- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern to provide a solid foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".
- **Hihat (H):** Maintained its dynamic pattern with soft and hard closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** Maintained the original hit on the third beat of the third measure for added flavor.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focused on the kick, hihat, and toms without any snare or cymbal hits.
