Alright, so I need to help edit a drum groove to include both kick and snare. Let's start by understanding the notation. Each line represents a different drum or cymbal, and each character corresponds to a 16th note. The symbols denote different types of hits, like hard or soft, open or closed.

Looking at the original groove, the kick drum (K) has a soft hit on the first beat and a hard hit on the third beat in the first bar, then it's mostly soft hits. The snare drum (S) has some activity but it's not very prominent. The hihat (H) has a mix of open and closed hits, which is good for rhythm. The toms (T) and crash cymbal (C) are barely used, and the ride cymbal (R) is mostly soft closed hits.

The edit request is to have not only kick but also snare. So, I need to make sure the snare is more prominent. Maybe add some hard hits on beats 2 and 4 to give it a backbeat feel. Also, ensure the kick drum has a consistent pattern to drive the rhythm.

I'll start by adjusting the kick drum to have a mix of hard and soft hits to keep it dynamic. Then, I'll add snare hits on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits (O) for emphasis. I'll keep the hihat pattern to maintain the rhythmic flow but maybe alternate between open and closed hits for variety. The toms and crash cymbal can be added sparingly to add flavor without overpowering the main rhythm. The ride cymbal can remain with soft closed hits to keep a steady pulse.

Let me sketch this out:

- **Kick (K):** Start with a hard hit, then a soft hit, and alternate to keep it interesting.
- **Snare (S):** Add hard hits on beats 2 and 4 to create a strong backbeat.
- **Hihat (H):** Alternate between open and closed hits to add texture.
- **Toms (T):** Maybe add a hit on the "and" of beat 3 for some movement.
- **Crash (C):** Add a crash on the first beat for emphasis.
- **Ride (R):** Keep the soft closed hits to maintain a steady rhythm.

Putting it all together, I'll ensure that each instrument's hits align with the beats and that the overall groove feels balanced with both kick and snare being prominent.
