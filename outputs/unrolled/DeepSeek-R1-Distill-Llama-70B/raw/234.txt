Alright, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both snare and tom. Let's see what they have and what needs to be done.

First, looking at the original groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----  

The user wants to add both snare and tom. The current groove already has snare on beats 2 and 4, which is good. Now, I need to incorporate the tom without disrupting the existing rhythm.

I notice the tom line is empty, so I'll add some hits there. Toms usually play on off-beats or to add flavor. Maybe adding a soft hit on the "and" of beat 2 and a hard hit on the "and" of beat 4 would work. That way, it complements the snare and kick without clashing.

So, I'll modify the T line to include 'o' on the third 16th note of the second beat and 'O' on the third 16th note of the fourth beat. This should give the groove more depth without making it too busy.

Let me put it all together to make sure it flows well.
