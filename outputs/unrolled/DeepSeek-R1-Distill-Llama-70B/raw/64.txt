Alright, so I need to help the user by editing their drum groove to include both ride and hihat. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, I see that the user has provided a drum notation system and a specific groove they're working on. The current groove is:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The edit request is to ensure the groove has both ride and hihat. Looking at the current groove, I notice that the Hihat (H) and Ride (R) lines are empty. That means the groove is missing those elements.

I need to add hihat and ride cymbal hits. Let me recall the notation:

- **H:** O is a hard open hit, o is a soft open hit; X and x are hard and soft closed hits.
- **R:** O is a hard open hit on the bell, o is a soft open hit on the bell; X and x are hard and soft closed hits on the bow.

I should add some hihat patterns to give the groove a better rhythm. Maybe alternating between open and closed hits would work. For the ride cymbal, adding some soft closed hits (x) on off-beats could complement the hihat.

Let me sketch out the changes:

1. **Hihat (H):** Start with a soft closed hit on the first beat, then alternate with open hits to create a dynamic rhythm.
2. **Ride (R):** Add soft closed hits on the off-beats to add texture without overpowering the hihat.

Putting it all together, the updated groove would look like:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: x---|X---|x---|X---
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|x---|x---|x---

This way, both hihat and ride are incorporated, enhancing the groove as requested.
