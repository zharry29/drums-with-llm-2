Alright, so I've got this drum groove to edit, and the main request is to add snare drum hits to a groove that currently only has kick drum. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the existing groove. Looking at the notation:

@@@
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

From this, I can see that:

- **Kick Drum (K):** All characters are '-', meaning no kick drum hits in this bar.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Similarly, all '-', so no snare hits either.
- **Hihat (H):** There's a soft closed hit ('x') on the second and fourth beats of the second and fourth bars.
- **Toms (T):** No activity here, all '-'.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** No crashes, all '-'.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** There's a mix of soft closed hits ('x') and hard closed hits ('X') on various beats.

So, the current groove is quite minimal, with only the ride cymbal and hihat providing any rhythm. The user wants to add snare drum hits to this, and also include kick drum hits. The original instruction says the groove should have "not only kick but also snare," which implies that kick drum hits should be present alongside snare hits.

Given that, my goal is to create a balanced groove that includes both kick and snare, while maintaining a cohesive rhythm with the existing hihat and ride cymbal patterns.

**Step 1: Adding Kick Drum Hits**

First, I'll add kick drum hits. In most drum grooves, the kick drum typically plays on beats 1 and 3, providing the foundational pulse. However, depending on the genre and feel, it might also play on off-beats or other rhythmic points.

Looking at the existing hihat pattern:

- H: ----|x---|----|x---

This indicates that the hihat is playing on the second and fourth beats of each measure, specifically on the second 16th-note of those beats. This is a common pattern in many genres, providing a steady rhythmic underpinning.

Given that, I'll place kick drum hits on beats 1 and 3 to complement the hihat. This will create a basic "kick-snare" pattern, which is fundamental in many styles of music.

So, for the kick drum:

- K: O---|----|O---|----

This places hard kick hits ('O') on beats 1 and 3.

**Step 2: Adding Snare Drum Hits**

Next, I'll add snare drum hits. The snare typically plays on beats 2 and 4, creating the "backbeat" that gives the music its forward momentum. Given the existing hihat on beats 2 and 4, adding snare hits on these beats will enhance the rhythm and provide a more driving feel.

For the snare drum:

- S: ----|O---|----|O---

This places hard snare hits ('O') on beats 2 and 4.

**Step 3: Adjusting for Feel and Balance**

Now, I'll consider the overall feel and balance of the groove. The hihat is playing on every second and fourth beat, which is standard, but I want to ensure that the kick and snare are prominent without clashing with the hihat.

One thing to note is that the hihat is playing on the second 16th-note of beats 2 and 4, which is a common way to add a bit of "swing" or "feel" to the rhythm. To make the kick and snare hits clear and defined, I'll ensure that they are placed on the downbeats (the first 16th-note of each beat).

**Step 4: Finalizing the Groove**

Putting it all together, the updated groove will look like this:

@@@
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This groove now includes:

- Kick drum hits on beats 1 and 3
- Snare drum hits on beats 2 and 4
- Hihat playing on the second 16th-note of beats 2 and 4
- Ride cymbal with a mix of soft and hard closed hits

This creates a basic but solid rhythmic foundation that incorporates both kick and snare drums, fulfilling the user's request.
