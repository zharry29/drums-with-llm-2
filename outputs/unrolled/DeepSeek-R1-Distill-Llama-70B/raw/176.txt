Alright, so I need to edit this drum groove to include not only the tom but also the cymbal. Let me first understand the current groove and then figure out where to add the cymbal hits.

Looking at the given groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Okay, so the kick drum (K) is playing on beats 1, 2, and 4 in the first bar, with a soft hit on the second beat. The snare drum (S) is playing on the third beat of the third bar. The hihat (H) isn't playing at all in this groove. The toms (T) have a steady pattern with hard and soft hits alternating. The crash cymbal (C) and ride cymbal (R) aren't playing at all.

The edit request is to have the groove include not only tom but also cymbal. So, I need to add cymbal hits. The cymbals can be either crash (C) or ride (R). Since crash cymbals are typically used for accents and ride cymbals for rhythmic patterns, I'll consider adding crash cymbals on key beats to add flavor to the groove.

I'll start by adding crash cymbal hits on beats 1 and 3 of each bar. This will give a nice accent and complement the kick drum hits. Also, since the ride cymbal isn't playing, maybe adding a soft ride pattern could enhance the groove without overpowering it.

So, I'll update the C line to have O on beats 1 and 3 of each bar, and maybe add a soft ride pattern on the R line.

Let me sketch this out:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Wait, the user wants the final answer only between @@@, so I'll format it properly.
