Alright, I need to edit this drum groove so that there's no ride or snare. Let's start by looking at the original groove.

First, I see that the ride cymbal (R) has a pattern with both soft and hard hits. Since I don't want any ride, I'll set all its characters to "-".

Next, the snare drum (S) has a mix of hard hits and sidestick hits. To remove the snare, I'll also set all its characters to "-".

I'll keep the kick drum (K) as it is to maintain the foundation. The hihat (H) is already silent, so I'll leave it. The toms (T) and crash cymbal (C) are also silent, which is good because I don't want any additional flavors.

Finally, I'll review the pattern to ensure that only the kick drum is present. This way, the groove is minimalist and focuses solely on the kick drum without any ride or snare.

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This groove now features:
- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern, providing a solid foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash Cymbal (C), and Ride Cymbal (R):** All silenced as per the request.

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focused solely on the kick drum.
