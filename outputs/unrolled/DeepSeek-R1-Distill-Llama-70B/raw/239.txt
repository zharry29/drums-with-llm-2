Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both snare and tom hits. Let's see, the original groove is:

The user wants the groove to have not only snare but also tom. So, I need to add tom hits where appropriate.

First, I'll look at the snare drum line. It has hits on the second and fourth beats, which is a standard backbeat pattern. That's good. Now, for the toms, they're currently not being used. I should add some tom hits to complement the snare and kick.

Looking at the kick drum pattern, it's active on beats 1, 2, and 4, with some syncopation. I don't want the tom hits to clash with the kick, so I'll place them on off-beats or where the kick isn't playing.

In the first beat, the kick is on the first and third 16th notes. Maybe I can add a soft tom hit on the second 16th note to add some movement. In the third beat, the kick is on the first 16th note, so I can add a soft tom hit on the third 16th note.

I'll adjust the Tom line to include soft hits (o) on these off-beat positions to add texture without overpowering the kick and snare. This should make the groove more dynamic and balanced.

So, the updated Tom line will have soft hits on the second 16th note of the first beat and the third 16th note of the third beat. This way, the groove now includes both snare and tom hits as requested.
