Alright, so I've got this drum groove that I need to edit. The user wants the groove to have not only snare but also cymbal. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the current setup. The groove has a kick drum, snare drum, hihat, toms, crash cymbal, and ride cymbal. Each line represents a different drum or cymbal, and each character shows when it's played.

Looking at the given groove:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
```

I see that the kick drum is playing on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits ("O"). The snare drum has a mix of hard hits, soft open hits, and sidesticks. The ride cymbal is played with a mix of soft and hard hits. However, the crash cymbal isn't being used at all, and the hihat is completely silent.

The user wants to add more cymbal elements to the groove. Since the crash cymbal is currently unused, I can incorporate it to add accents. I'll add crash cymbal hits on the first beat of each measure to give the groove a stronger, more dynamic feel.

Also, to make sure the snare is prominent, I'll keep its current pattern but ensure it's balanced with the added cymbal hits. I'll also introduce the hihat with soft closed hits on the offbeats to provide a steady rhythm without overpowering the other elements.

Here's how I'll modify each line:

- **Kick Drum (K):** Keep the pattern as it is to maintain the foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Keep the existing pattern to ensure it remains a focal point.
- **Hihat (H):** Add soft closed hits on the offbeats to add texture.
- **Toms (T):** Keep silent to avoid overcrowding.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Add hard hits on the first beat of each measure.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Keep the dynamic pattern but adjust to complement the crash cymbal.

After making these changes, the groove should have a nice balance between the snare and cymbals, making both elements stand out without clashing.

Here's the revised drum groove with both snare and cymbals prominently featured:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Added hard hits ("O") on the first beat of each measure to add strong accents and fulfill the cymbal requirement.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Maintained its dynamic pattern with a mix of hard hits ("O"), soft open hits ("o"), and sidestick hits ("x").
- **Hihat (H):** Added soft closed hits ("x") on every offbeat to provide a steady rhythm.
- **Kick Drum (K):** Kept unchanged to provide a solid foundation on beats 1 and 3.
- **Toms (T):** Kept silent to avoid overcrowding the groove.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Maintained its dynamic pattern with a mix of soft ("o") and hard ("O") hits, complementing the crash cymbal.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and cymbals featured prominently.
