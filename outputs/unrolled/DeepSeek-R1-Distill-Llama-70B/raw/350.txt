Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any snare or cymbal hits from the given pattern. 

First, I'll look at the original groove:

```
K: OOO-|---O-|OOO-|---O
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

**Kick Drum (K):** It's already set with a mix of hard and soft hits. I'll keep this as is since the user didn't mention changing it.

**Snare Drum (S):** The user wants no snare, so I'll set all its hits to "-".

**Hihat (H):** It's already silent, so no changes needed.

**Toms (T):** Also silent, so no changes.

**Crash Cymbal (C):** Needs to be removed, so I'll set all its hits to "-".

**Ride Cymbal (R):** Already silent, so no changes.

After making these changes, the final groove will only have the kick drum and any other unchanged parts. I'll make sure to set all snare and cymbal lines to "-" to fulfill the request.
</think>

```
K: OOO-|---O-|OOO-|---O
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This groove now features:
- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern with both hard and soft hits.
- **Snare Drum (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash Cymbal (C), and Ride Cymbal (R):** All silenced as per the edit request.

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focused solely on the kick drum without any snare or cymbal hits.
