Alright, so the user wants me to create a drum groove that includes both snare and ride cymbal. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided. It looks like the kick drum is playing on beats 1 and 3, the snare is on beat 3, and the toms have a busy pattern. There's no hihat or ride cymbal in the original.

First, I need to make sure the snare is prominent. In the original, it's only on beat 3, so maybe I can add it to beat 4 as well for a stronger backbeat. Next, I need to incorporate the ride cymbal. I'll add it on the offbeats to give it a steady rhythm without overpowering the snare. 

I'll also simplify the kick drum pattern to keep it solid on beats 1 and 3. The toms can stay busy to add flavor, but I'll make sure they don't clash with the snare and ride. Finally, I'll add a crash cymbal on the first beat to give the groove a strong start.

Here's the revised drum groove with both snare and ride cymbal prominently featured:

```
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
R: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Kick Drum (K):** Simplified to play on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits ("O"), providing a solid foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Added on beats 3 and 4 with hard hits ("O"), making it more prominent and driving.
- **Hihat (H):** Added with soft closed hits ("x") on every eighth note, providing a steady rhythm.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with soft closed hits ("x") on every eighth note, complementing the hihat and adding texture.
- **Toms (T):** Maintained the original busy pattern with alternating hard and soft hits, adding flavor.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Added on beat 1 with a hard hit ("O"), providing a strong accent.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and ride cymbal featured prominently.
