Alright, I need to add some cymbal to this drum groove. Let me look at the current groove first.

The kick drum (K) has a pretty steady rhythm with some soft hits. The snare drum (S) is also active with a mix of hard and soft hits. The hihat (H) is playing a consistent pattern with open and closed hits. The toms (T) are not being used here, and the crash cymbal (C) has some hits, but I can add more. The ride cymbal (R) isn't being used at all.

I want to enhance the groove by adding more cymbal sounds. Crash cymbals are great for accents and adding drama, while ride cymbals can provide a steady rhythmic texture. I'll add crash cymbals on beats 1 and 3 of the first and third measures to give it some accents. For the ride cymbal, I'll add a steady rhythm in the fourth measure to build up the groove.

Let me update the notation accordingly.
