Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove based on their request. The user has provided a drum groove and an edit request. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the original drum groove they provided. It's in a specific notation where each line represents a different drum or cymbal. The lines are for K (Kick), S (Snare), H (Hihat), T (Toms), C (Crash cymbal), and R (Ride cymbal). Each character in these lines represents a 16th note, and the beats are separated by "|".

The user's edit request is: "The groove should have not only tom but also ride." So, they want the Toms (T) and Ride cymbal (R) to be more prominent or present in the groove.

Looking at the original groove, the Toms (T) line is all dashes, meaning they're not played at all. The Ride cymbal (R) has a pattern with "x" and "X" indicating soft and hard closed hits, but it's not very active throughout the bar.

My goal is to modify this groove to include both Tom hits and Ride cymbal hits. I should ensure that the Toms are added without making the groove too busy, and the Ride cymbal should complement the rhythm.

I'll start by adding Tom hits. Since the original groove doesn't have any Toms, I'll place them in beats where it makes sense rhythmically, perhaps on the "and" of beats to add some syncopation. I'll use "O" for hard hits on the Toms.

Next, I'll enhance the Ride cymbal line. The original has a good pattern, but I can make it more consistent by adding a few more hits, maybe on the offbeats, to give it a driving feel. I'll alternate between "X" and "x" to vary the articulation.

I'll also check the other instruments to ensure that adding Toms and Ride hits doesn't clash with the existing patterns. The Kick (K) and Snare (S) have a straightforward pattern, and the Hihat (H) is providing a steady rhythm. Adding Toms and Ride should enhance the overall feel without conflicting.

Finally, I'll make sure the modified groove adheres to the 16th note structure and that the beats are correctly separated by "|". I'll review each line to ensure there are no errors and that the groove flows naturally.

After making these changes, I'll present the final groove to the user, ensuring it's formatted correctly between "@@@" as they requested.
