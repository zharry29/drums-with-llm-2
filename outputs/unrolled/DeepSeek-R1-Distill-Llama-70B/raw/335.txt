Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove according to the user's request. Let me see what they asked for. They don't want any hihat or tom in the groove. 

Looking at the original groove, I see that the hihat is present on beats 2 and 4 with soft closed hits ("x"). The toms are also present but set to "-" in the given groove, so they're already silent. The crash cymbal and ride cymbal are also present, but the user didn't mention them, so I guess they can stay.

First, I need to remove the hihat completely. That means setting all the hihat characters to "-". Since the toms are already "-", they're already removed, so I don't need to change anything there.

I should also ensure that no other instruments are affected. The kick, snare, crash, and ride should remain as they are unless specified otherwise.

So, I'll go through each line and set the hihat and tom lines to all "-". The final groove should only have the kick, snare, crash, and ride, with hihat and tom removed.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any hihat or tom hits. Yep, they're all set to "-", so the groove now only features the requested instruments.

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

**Explanation:**

- **Kick Drum (K):** All hits have been removed by setting all characters to "-".
- **Snare Drum (S):** All hits have been removed by setting all characters to "-".
- **Hihat (H):** All hits have been removed by setting all characters to "-".
- **Toms (T):** All hits have been removed by setting all characters to "-".
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** All hits have been removed by setting all characters to "-".
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** All hits have been removed by setting all characters to "-".

This results in a completely silent groove with no instruments playing, as all lines have been set to "-" to remove any hits.
