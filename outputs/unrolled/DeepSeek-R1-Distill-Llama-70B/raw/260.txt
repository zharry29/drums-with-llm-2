Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both kick and ride cymbal. Let me first understand the original groove and the edit request.

The original groove has:
- **Kick (K):** O---|----|O---|---- (so, beats 1 and 3)
- **Snare (S):** ----|----|S---|---- (beat 3)
- **Hihat (H):** x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x- (steady 16th notes)
- **Toms (T):** ----|----|---O|---- (beat 3)
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** O---|O---|O---|O--- (beats 1, 2, 3, 4)
- **Ride (R):** ----|----|----|---- (no hits)

The edit request is to have not only kick but also ride. So, I need to add ride cymbal hits without removing the kick drum hits.

Looking at the original, the kick is on beats 1 and 3, and the crash cymbal is on every beat. The ride cymbal is currently not played at all.

I need to add ride cymbal hits. Since the crash is already on every beat, adding ride on off-beats or specific beats can add texture without clashing. Maybe adding ride on beats 2 and 4 would complement the kick on 1 and 3.

So, I'll modify the ride line to have hits on beats 2 and 4. I'll use 'X' for a hard closed hit to keep it subtle and not overpowering.

Final ride line: X---|----|X---|----
