Okay, so I need to help edit a drum groove by adding cymbals. Let's start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

First, looking at the original groove, it's a 4/4 time bar with four beats, each beat having four 16th notes. The instruments are Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash cymbal (C), and Ride cymbal (R).

The original groove looks like this:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

From this, I can see that the Kick drum has hits on the first and third beats, the Snare has some hits on the second and fourth beats with some variations, the Hihat is playing a steady rhythm, and the Toms, Crash, and Ride cymbals are not being used.

The edit request is to add cymbals to the groove. The user mentioned that the groove should have not only kick but also cymbal. Since the user didn't specify which cymbal, I'll assume they mean adding Crash cymbals, which are typically used to accentuate the start of a new section or to add flavor at specific points in the music.

I need to decide where to place the Crash cymbals. A common practice is to have the Crash cymbal hit on the first beat of the bar to mark the beginning of a new section or to add emphasis. Sometimes, it's also used on the fourth beat to lead into a new section.

Looking at the original groove, the first beat of the first measure already has a Kick drum hit. Adding a Crash cymbal on the same beat could create a stronger, more impactful sound. Additionally, adding a Crash on the fourth beat could help in creating a sense of movement towards the next bar.

So, I'll add a Crash cymbal (C) on the first and fourth beats of the first measure. The notation for a hard hit on the Crash cymbal is 'O'. Therefore, the C line will change from '----|----|----|----' to 'O---|----|----|O---'.

Let me visualize the updated groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This way, the Crash cymbal adds emphasis on the first and fourth beats, complementing the Kick drum and enhancing the overall feel of the groove without overpowering the existing rhythm.

I should also double-check that I'm not overcomplicating the groove. Since the edit request is to add cymbals, and I've added them in logical places, this should meet the user's requirements.

Finally, I'll present the updated groove in the required notation format.
