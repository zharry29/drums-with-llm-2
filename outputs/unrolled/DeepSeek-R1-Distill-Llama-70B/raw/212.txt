Alright, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both hihat and cymbal. Let me start by understanding the problem and the existing groove.

First, I'll look at the provided drum groove:

```
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

From this, I can see that the kick (K) is active on beats 1 and 3, the snare (S) is on beat 3, the toms (T) are playing a steady rhythm, and there's no hihat (H) or cymbal (C) activity.

The user's edit request is to have not only hihat but also cymbal in the groove. So, my task is to add both hihat and cymbal parts to this existing groove.

First, I'll think about the hihat. In drum grooves, the hihat usually provides a rhythmic foundation, often playing on off-beats or in a steady 8th or 16th note pattern. Since the user wants a more dynamic groove, adding the hihat on off-beats could enhance the rhythm.

Next, the cymbal. Crash cymbals are typically used to accentuate certain beats or to add color to the groove. They can be placed on beat 1 or at the end of a phrase to give a sense of resolution.

Looking at the existing groove, the kick and snare are already providing a basic foundation. Adding the hihat on the off-beats (like the 'e' and 'a' of each beat) will make the rhythm more driving. For the cymbal, placing a crash on the first beat of each measure will add a bright, accentuated sound.

Now, I'll map out how to integrate these into the existing groove:

- **Hihat (H):** I'll add 'x' on the off-beats to create a steady rhythm. This will go in the second and fourth positions of each beat, as those are the off-beats in a 4/4 time signature.
  
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** I'll place an 'O' on the first beat of each measure to add a crash, giving the groove a more dynamic feel.

I'll also ensure that the existing elements like kick, snare, and toms remain unchanged to maintain the original feel of the groove.

Putting it all together, the updated groove will have the hihat playing on the off-beats and the crash cymbal accenting the beginning of each measure. This should fulfill the user's request by adding both hihat and cymbal to the groove.
