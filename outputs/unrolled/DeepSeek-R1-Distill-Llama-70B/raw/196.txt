Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both tom and snare. Let's start by understanding the current setup.

Looking at the provided drum groove, the snare (S) is already present with some hits, but the tom (T) isn't being used. The edit request specifically asks to add tom hits alongside the snare. 

First, I'll review the existing snare hits to ensure they're balanced and effective. The snare is on beats 2 and 4, which is standard for backbeats. I'll keep these as they are since they provide a solid foundation.

Next, I'll focus on adding the tom hits. Toms are typically used to add flavor and rhythm, often on off-beats or to create a fill. I'll look for spots where adding a tom hit won't clash with the snare or kick. 

I notice that the third beat in the second and fourth bars are empty for the tom. Adding a soft tom hit (o) here will complement the existing rhythm without overpowering it. This creates a subtle but effective addition that enhances the groove.

I'll also ensure that the crash cymbal (C) and ride cymbal (R) are balanced. The crash is already on beat 1, providing a strong accent, and the ride is playing a steady rhythm. No changes are needed there.

Finally, I'll review the entire groove to make sure all elements are in harmony and that the additions don't disrupt the flow. The kick (K) and hi-hat (H) patterns remain unchanged, maintaining the song's foundation.

By adding the tom hits strategically, the groove becomes more dynamic without losing its original feel.
