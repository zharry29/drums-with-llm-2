Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a drum groove and an edit request. The goal is to modify the groove according to the request and present the final result in the specified notation. 

First, I need to understand the drum notation provided. It seems each line represents a different drum or cymbal, and each character within those lines denotes whether that instrument is played on that particular 16th note. The characters can vary based on the instrument, indicating different types of hits or articulations.

The user's edit request is to remove both the hihat and tom from the groove. That means I need to ensure that in the final notation, the lines corresponding to H (Hihat) and T (Toms) are completely silent, i.e., all characters in those lines should be set to "-".

Looking at the provided drum groove:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|X--o|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|-O--|---o
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----
```

And the edit request is to remove hihat and tom, I'll need to:

1. **Silence the Hihat (H):** Set all characters in the H line to "-".
2. **Silence the Toms (T):** Set all characters in the T line to "-".

The other instruments (K, S, C, R) can remain as they are unless the user specifies further changes, which they haven't in this case.

So, the modified groove would look like:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|X--o|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----
```

I need to ensure that I don't accidentally alter any other parts of the groove. It's crucial to only modify the lines specified in the edit request to avoid introducing unintended changes.

Additionally, I should double-check that the final notation adheres to the 16-character per line format, not counting the "|" separators, to maintain the integrity of the 4/4 time signature with 16 16th notes.

Finally, I'll present the final groove as per the user's instructions, ensuring it's enclosed within the "@@@" markers and free of any additional text or explanations, as per their request.
