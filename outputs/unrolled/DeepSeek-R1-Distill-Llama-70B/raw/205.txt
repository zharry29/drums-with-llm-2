Okay, so I'm trying to help the user edit their drum groove based on their request. The user provided a drum groove and an edit request. The groove is in a specific notation, and the edit request is to have "not only snare but also hihat." 

First, I need to understand the current groove. Looking at the provided notation, each line represents a different drum or cymbal. The user's groove has the following:

- **K:** Kick drum
- **S:** Snare drum
- **H:** Hihat
- **T:** Toms
- **C:** Crash cymbal
- **R:** Ride cymbal

The edit request is to add both snare and hihat to the groove. So, I need to ensure that both the snare and hihat are present in the edited version.

Looking at the current groove, I can see that the snare (S) is already present with some hits, and the hihat (H) is also present but might need to be enhanced or adjusted based on the edit request.

I should check each line to see where the snare and hihat are played and see if they can be adjusted or added to meet the request. The goal is to make sure both instruments are included and perhaps make their parts more prominent or balanced.

I'll go through each instrument line by line to see what's currently there and where I can make changes to include both snare and hihat effectively.

After analyzing, I'll make the necessary adjustments to the notation to ensure both snare and hihat are included as per the edit request.
