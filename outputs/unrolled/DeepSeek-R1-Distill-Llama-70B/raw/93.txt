Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove by adding more hihat. Let me see what they have so far. The original groove has the hihat part as "--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-". The user wants to make sure the groove has not only kick but also hihat, so I guess they want more hihat activity.

First, I should understand the current hihat pattern. It looks like it's a mix of open and closed hits, which is good. But maybe it's not prominent enough. To make the hihat more present, I can make it play on every offbeat or add more closed hits.

I remember that in drum notation, "x" and "X" are closed hits, while "o" and "O" are open hits. So, if I change some of the open hits to closed hits, the hihat will be more consistent. Maybe alternating between open and closed hits on the offbeats would make it more dynamic.

Looking at the current pattern: "--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-". It seems like the second note in each beat is an open hit, and the fourth is a closed hit. I can make the second note a closed hit and keep the fourth as is. So it would look like "X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-".

I should check if this makes the hihat more prominent without clashing with other instruments. The kick and snare are on beats 1 and 3, so the hihat on the offbeats should complement them without overlapping.

I think this change will make the hihat more consistent and give the groove a better rhythm. Let me update the hihat line accordingly and make sure the rest of the groove stays the same.
