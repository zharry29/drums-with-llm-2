Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove to include both tom and hihat. Let me look at the current groove first.

The Kick (K) is already being used with "O---|----|O---|----", which is a good foundation. The Snare (S) is on beats 2 and 4 with "----|O---|----|O---", which is standard. The Hihat (H) is playing all the time with "X---|X---|X---|X---", which is a continuous rhythm. The Toms (T) are not being used at all, and the Crash (C) and Ride (R) are also not present.

The edit request is to have not only tom but also hihat. Wait, the hihat is already there, but maybe they want more prominent hihat hits or a different pattern. Also, the tom needs to be added.

I think I should add the tom hits on specific beats to complement the kick and snare. Maybe on the off-beats or on the 'and' of beat 2 and 4. For the hihat, since it's already playing, perhaps I can vary it a bit to make it more dynamic, maybe adding some open and closed hits.

Let me sketch this out. I'll keep the kick and snare as they are. For the hihat, I'll add some variation, maybe using "O" for open and "X" for closed hits. For the tom, I'll add hits on beats where the kick isn't playing to add depth.

So, the final groove would have the kick on beats 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat with a mix of open and closed hits, and toms on the off-beats to fill in the gaps.
