Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both kick and snare drums. Let's start by understanding the original groove they provided.

Looking at the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** It has hits on the first, third, and fourth beats. It's pretty active, which is good, but there's no snare to back it up on beats 2 and 4.
  
- **Snare (S):** There are some hits here, but they're not consistent. The user wants a groove that includes both kick and snare, so I need to make sure the snare is prominent on beats 2 and 4, which is typical in many music genres.

- **Hihat (H):** It's playing a steady 16th-note pattern with closed hits (X and x). This is good for keeping the rhythm tight.

- **Toms (T):** There are no tom hits in the original groove, so that's something I could add for extra flavor, maybe on off-beats to add some movement.

- **Crash (C) and Ride (R):** These are not used in the original groove. Adding a crash on beat 1 could give a nice accent, and using the ride to add some texture on other beats might enhance the overall sound.

Now, thinking about how to incorporate the snare effectively. I'll place hard snare hits (O) on beats 2 and 4 to create a solid backbeat. Maybe add some softer snare hits (o) on other beats to add some variety without overpowering the main rhythm.

For the kick drum, I'll keep it active but ensure it doesn't clash with the snare. Maybe add some syncopation to make the groove more interesting. Perhaps a soft kick (o) on the "and" of beat 1 to add some movement.

The hihat is already providing a good foundation, so I'll keep that steady. Adding a crash on beat 1 will help define the start of each measure. For the ride cymbal, using soft closed hits (x) on beats 2 and 4 will add some subtle texture without being too overpowering.

Toms can be added on the off-beats to give the groove some dynamic interest. Maybe a hard tom hit (O) on the "and" of beat 2 and a soft hit (o) on the "and" of beat 4.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each beat to ensure that the kick and snare are balanced, with the other instruments complementing the rhythm without making it too busy.

I need to make sure that the notation is correct, with each line representing the correct instrument and each character accurately showing when and how the instrument is played. Also, ensuring that the bars are correctly divided into beats with the | separator.

After making these adjustments, I'll review the groove to ensure it flows well and meets the user's request of having both kick and snare prominent in the mix.
