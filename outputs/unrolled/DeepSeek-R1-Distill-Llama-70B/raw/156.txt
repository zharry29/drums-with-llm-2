Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove based on their request. Let's see what they have and what they want.

First, looking at the original drum groove they provided:

@@@  
K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----  
@@@  

They mentioned that the groove should have "not only cymbal but also kick." So, I need to understand what that means.

In drum notation, "cymbal" could refer to either the crash cymbal (C) or the ride cymbal (R). In their original groove, both C and R are not being usedâ€”they're all dashes, meaning those instruments aren't played. The kick drum (K) is being used, but the user wants more emphasis on both the cymbals and the kick.

So, the goal is to adjust the groove so that both the kick drum and the cymbals are more prominent. Since the user mentioned "not only cymbal but also kick," it implies that currently, the groove might be lacking in one or both of these elements, and they want both to be present.

Looking at the original groove, the kick drum (K) has some hits, but the cymbals (C and R) are entirely absent. The hihat (H) is being used extensively, which is good, but the user wants to incorporate cymbals as well.

So, I'll need to add cymbal hits to the groove. Since crash cymbals are typically used on beats 1 and 3 in many grooves, I'll consider adding them there. Alternatively, ride cymbals can be used on off-beats to add texture.

But since the user wants "not only cymbal but also kick," I'll focus on crash cymbals (C) because they provide a more pronounced sound that can complement the kick drum. I'll add crash cymbal hits on beats 1 and 3 to give the groove more definition.

Also, I should ensure that the kick drum is used appropriately. The original groove already has some kick hits, but perhaps adding a few more or adjusting their placement could enhance the overall feel.

Let's plan the changes:

1. **Kick Drum (K):** Keep the existing pattern but maybe add a kick on beats where the snare is playing to create a stronger backbeat.

2. **Snare Drum (S):** The snare is already on beats 2 and 4, which is standard. I'll keep that as it is.

3. **Hihat (H):** The hihat is already being used on every 16th note, which is great for rhythm. I'll keep that unchanged.

4. **Crash Cymbal (C):** Add crash cymbal hits on beats 1 and 3 to emphasize those beats.

5. **Ride Cymbal (R):** Since the user didn't specify ride cymbals, I'll leave them out for now.

Now, let's apply these changes to the original groove.

Original K line: O---|----|O---|----  
I'll add a kick on the 4th beat of the first measure and adjust the second measure to have kicks on beats 1 and 3.

Original C line: ----|----|----|----  
I'll add crash cymbals on beats 1 and 3 of each measure.

Putting it all together, the updated groove would look like this:

@@@  
K: O---|O---|O---|O---  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|----|O---|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

This way, the groove now has both the kick drum and crash cymbals prominent on beats 1 and 3, fulfilling the user's request.
