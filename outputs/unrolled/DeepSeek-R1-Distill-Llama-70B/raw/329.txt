Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove by removing both the ride and snare drums. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided.

Looking at the original groove, I see that the snare drum (S) has some hits, and the ride cymbal (R) is also present. The user wants both of these removed. 

First, I'll focus on the snare drum. In the original groove, the snare has hits on the third beat of the second measure and the fourth beat of the fourth measure. To remove the snare, I'll set all its characters to "-", which means it won't play anything.

Next, I'll look at the ride cymbal. In the original groove, the ride is silent, so there's nothing to remove there. But since the user explicitly mentioned not wanting any ride, I'll make sure it remains silent by keeping all its characters as "-".

Now, I'll go through each instrument line by line to apply these changes:

- **Kick Drum (K):** I'll keep the original pattern as it is since the user didn't mention any changes to the kick.
- **Snare Drum (S):** I'll set all characters to "-" to remove any hits.
- **Hihat (H):** I'll keep the hihat pattern unchanged to maintain the rhythm.
- **Toms (T):** The toms have a hit on the third beat of the third measure. Since the user didn't mention removing toms, I'll leave this as is.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** I'll keep the crash cymbal hits on the first beat of each measure to add accents.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** I'll ensure all characters are "-" to remove any ride hits.

After making these changes, I'll review the groove to ensure that both the snare and ride are completely removed and that the remaining instruments still provide a coherent rhythm.

Finally, I'll present the edited groove with only the kick, hihat, toms, and crash cymbal playing, as per the user's request.

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|----|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

**Explanation:**

- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintained the original pattern to provide a solid foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".
- **Hihat (H):** Kept the dynamic pattern with soft and hard closed hits to maintain rhythm.
- **Toms (T):** Maintained the original hit on the third beat of the third measure for added flavor.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept the accents on the first beat of each measure for added emphasis.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".

This arrangement creates a rhythm focused on the kick, hihat, toms, and crash cymbal without any snare or ride cymbal.
