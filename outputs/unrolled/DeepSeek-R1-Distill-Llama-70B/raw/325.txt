Okay, so I need to help the user edit a drum groove according to their request. Let's see what they've given me.

First, they provided a drum notation system with various instruments: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash cymbal (C), and Ride cymbal (R). Each line represents a different instrument, and each character in a line denotes a 16th note. The characters can be '-', 'O', 'o', 'X', or 'x', each representing different types of hits or silences.

The user then gave me a specific drum groove they want to edit. The original groove has some activity on the kick, snare, hihat, toms, and crash cymbal, but the ride cymbal is silent. The user's edit request is to remove both the ride and snare drums from the groove.

Alright, so my task is to take the given drum groove and modify it by removing any hits on the snare and ride cymbals. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the original groove:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

Looking at this, the snare drum (S) has hits on the second and fourth beats of each measure, represented by 'O'. The ride cymbal (R) is completely silent, with all '-'.

The user wants to remove both the snare and ride cymbals. Since the ride is already silent, I only need to focus on removing the snare hits.

To remove the snare, I'll set all its hits to '-', effectively silencing it. So, the snare line will look like:

```
S: ----|----|----|----
```

The rest of the instruments should remain unchanged unless specified, so I'll leave the kick, hihat, toms, and crash cymbal as they are.

Putting it all together, the edited groove should look like this:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This way, the snare and ride cymbals are removed, and the groove now focuses solely on the kick, hihat, and crash cymbal, creating a simpler rhythm without the backbeats and additional cymbal work.
</think>

Here is the edited drum groove with the ride and snare removed:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This groove now features:
- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern, providing a solid foundation.
- **Hihat (H):** Continues with a mix of soft and hard hits, adding texture.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Provides accents on the first beat of each measure.
- **Snare Drum (S) and Ride Cymbal (R):** Silenced as per the request.

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focusing on the kick, hihat, and crash cymbal.
