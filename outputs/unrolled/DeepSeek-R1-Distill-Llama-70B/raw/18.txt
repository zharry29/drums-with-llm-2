Okay, I need to add some cymbal to the groove. Let me look at the current drum groove first. 

The Kick (K), Snare (S), and Tom (T) lines are all empty except for the Ride (R) and Hihat (H) which have some notes. The Crash (C) is completely empty. 

Cymbals like Crash (C) and Ride (R) can add flavor and accents to the music. Since the request is to add some cymbal, I think adding Crash cymbals on beats 1 and 3 would make the groove more dynamic. 

I'll add a hard hit "O" on the Crash line at the first and third beats. This should give the groove a nice accent without overpowering the other instruments.
