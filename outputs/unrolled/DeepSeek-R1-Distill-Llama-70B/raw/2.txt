Alright, so I need to help the user add some tom hits to their drum groove. Let's see what they've provided.

First, I'll look at the original drum groove they gave. It seems like they have a pretty simple pattern with the kick, snare, and toms already, but they want to enhance it by adding more tom hits.

Okay, so the original groove is:

K: O---|O---|----|O---

H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Hmm, the toms are already being used here with a pattern of O-o- repeated in each beat. But maybe the user wants to add more variety or emphasis with additional tom hits.

I should consider where it would make sense to add tom hits without clashing with the existing kick and snare hits. Let's break it down beat by beat.

In the first beat, the kick is on the first 16th note, and the tom is on the third. Maybe I can add a soft hit on the second 16th note to create a little rhythm.

In the second beat, the kick is on the first note again, and the tom on the third. Adding a soft hit on the second note here as well could maintain consistency.

The third beat has a snare on the third note. Maybe adding a tom on the second note could add some interest without conflicting.

The fourth beat has the kick on the first note and the tom on the third. Adding a soft hit on the second note here would keep the pattern consistent.

So, I'll modify the T line to include these additional soft hits. The original T line is O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-. I'll change it to O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o- with the added soft hits on the second 16th notes of each beat.

Let me write out the updated groove with these changes.
