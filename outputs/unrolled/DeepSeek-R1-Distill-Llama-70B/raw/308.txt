Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both snare and cymbals. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided. It looks like this:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

From this, I can see that the kick drum (K) is silent, the snare drum (S) isn't being used, the hihat (H) has some soft hits on beats 2 and 4, the toms (T) are silent, the crash cymbal (C) isn't used, and the ride cymbal (R) has a dynamic pattern with soft and hard hits.

The user's request is to modify this groove so that it includes both snare and cymbals. Since the original groove already has a ride cymbal pattern, I assume they want to add crash cymbals as well. Additionally, they want the snare drum to be included.

First, I'll think about where to place the snare hits. Typically, snares are placed on beats 2 and 4 to create a backbeat. So, I'll add snare hits on those beats. I'll use "O" for hard hits on the snare drum.

Next, for the cymbals, the ride is already present, so I'll add crash cymbals on beats 1 and 3 to add accents. Crash cymbals are usually used to emphasize the start of a measure or to add impact.

I'll keep the hihat pattern as it is, with soft closed hits on beats 2 and 4, to maintain a steady rhythm without overpowering the snare and cymbals.

The kick drum was silent in the original, but to provide a solid foundation, I'll add soft hits ("o") on every other beat. This will give a subtle but steady bass drum presence.

Putting it all together, the revised groove will have:
- Kick drum (K): Soft hits on beats 1 and 3.
- Snare drum (S): Hard hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Hihat (H): Soft closed hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Toms (T): Silent to keep the focus on the snare and cymbals.
- Crash cymbal (C): Hard hits on beats 1 and 3.
- Ride cymbal (R): Maintained dynamic pattern for texture.

I'll make sure to only include the final groove between the "@@@" as per the instructions.

Here's the final drum groove with both snare and cymbals prominently featured:

```
K: o---|----|o---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

This groove now includes:
- **Snare Drum (S):** Added hard hits ("O") on beats 2 and 4, creating a driving backbeat.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Added hard hits ("O") on beats 1 and 3 to add accents and fulfill the cymbal requirement.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Maintained with a dynamic pattern alternating between soft ("x") and hard ("X") hits, complementing the crash cymbal.
- **Kick Drum (K):** Added soft hits ("o") on beats 1 and 3 to provide a subtle foundation.
- **Hihat (H):** Kept with soft closed hits ("x") on beats 2 and 4 to support the rhythm.
- **Toms (T):** Kept silent to avoid overcrowding the groove.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and cymbals featured prominently.
