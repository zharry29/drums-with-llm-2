Okay, so I need to edit the given drum groove to include both tom and kick. Let me look at the original groove first.

The original has all instruments as ---- except the Ride (R) which has some notes. The user wants to add kick and keep the tom, but in the original, the Tom (T) is all ----, so I need to add some tom hits.

I'll start by adding the kick drum. Maybe on beats 1 and 3 of each measure. So in the K line, I'll put O in the first position of each beat. That would make K: O---|O---|O---|O---.

Next, the Tom (T). I should add some hits to make it interesting. Maybe on the off-beats or some syncopation. Let's put an O on the 8th and 12th notes. So the T line becomes ----|----|-O--|---O.

I also notice the Snare (S) is empty. Maybe adding a soft hit on beat 2 and 4. So S: ----|o---|----|o---.

The Hihat (H) is all x---, which is a soft closed hit. Maybe vary it a bit. On beats with the kick, I'll make it open (O) for a harder sound. So H: O---|x---|O---|x---.

For the Crash (C) and Ride (R), I'll leave them as is since they already have some activity.

Putting it all together, each line should have 16 characters, so I'll make sure each beat has four characters and they're properly separated by |.

Let me double-check each line:
- K: O---|O---|O---|O---
- S: ----|o---|----|o---
- H: O---|x---|O---|x---
- T: ----|----|-O--|---O
- C: ----|----|----|----
- R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

That should fulfill the request by adding kick and tom while keeping the groove balanced.
