Alright, I need to help the user create a drum groove that includes both snare and kick drums. Let me start by understanding the current groove they provided. It looks like the kick drum is using soft hits ("o") on every other beat, which is a bit subtle. The snare drum has some hard hits ("X") but could be more prominent. 

First, I'll focus on enhancing the kick drum. I want it to have a stronger presence, so I'll change the soft hits ("o") to hard hits ("O") on beats 1 and 3. This will give the groove a solid foundation. 

Next, the snare drum. It currently has some hard hits, but I can make it more dynamic by adding more hard hits ("O") on beats 2 and 4. This will create a driving backbeat that complements the kick drum.

I'll keep the hihat and toms as they are since they provide a good rhythmic texture without overpowering the main elements. The crash and ride cymbals are also fine, adding the necessary accents and texture.

Finally, I'll ensure that the overall rhythm is balanced and dynamic, making sure that both the snare and kick drums are featured prominently without clashing.

```
K: O---|---O|O---|---O
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: -x--|-x--|-x--|-x--
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

1. **Kick Drum (K):** Changed from soft hits ("o") to hard hits ("O") on beats 1 and 3 to create a stronger foundation.
2. **Snare Drum (S):** Added hard hits ("O") on beats 2 and 4 to emphasize the backbeats.
3. **Hihat (H):** Maintained soft closed hits ("x") to provide a steady rhythm.
4. **Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept hard hits ("O") on the first beat for accents.
5. **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added soft closed hits ("x") on the offbeats to complement the hihat.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and kick drum featured prominently.
