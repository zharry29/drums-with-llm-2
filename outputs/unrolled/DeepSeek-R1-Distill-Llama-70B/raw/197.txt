Okay, so I need to help edit a drum groove to include both tom and snare. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

First, the original drum groove is:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

From this, I can see that the Kick (K) has hits on the 1st, 2nd, and 4th beats, with a soft hit on the 2nd beat of the second bar. The Snare (S) has hits on the 2nd and 4th beats. The Hihat (H) has a steady rhythm with a mix of open and closed hits. The Tom (T) isn't being used, and the Crash (C) and Ride (R) cymbals are also not used.

The edit request is to have the groove include not only tom but also snare. So, the current groove already has snare on beats 2 and 4, but it's missing the tom. My task is to add tom hits while maintaining a balanced and musical feel.

I need to decide where to place the tom hits. Toms are often used to add flavor and rhythm, especially on off-beats or to accentuate certain parts of the rhythm. Since the original groove has a steady kick and snare, adding tom hits on the off-beats could enhance the rhythm without clashing with the existing hits.

Looking at the Hihat line, it has a pattern of open and closed hits. Maybe I can mirror some of that rhythm with the toms to create a cohesive sound. Alternatively, placing tom hits on the "and" of beats 2 and 4 could add some movement.

I'll start by adding a soft tom hit (o) on the "and" of beat 2 in the first bar and on the "and" of beat 4 in the second bar. This should complement the existing snare hits without overpowering them.

So, updating the Tom line:

T: ----|---o|----|---o

This adds soft tom hits on the off-beats, giving the groove more texture without disrupting the main rhythm.

I'll keep the rest of the groove as is to maintain consistency and ensure that the addition of the toms enhances the overall feel without making it too busy.

Now, putting it all together, the updated groove with both tom and snare will look like this:

@@@
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|---o|----|---o
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This way, the groove now includes both snare and tom hits, fulfilling the edit request.
