Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both cymbal and snare. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

The original groove is:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

From this, I can see that the kick (K) and snare (S) are not active, the hihat (H) has a steady rhythm on the off-beats, the toms (T) are silent, the crash cymbal (C) isn't used, and the ride cymbal (R) has a mix of open and closed hits.

The edit request is to have not only cymbal but also snare. So, I need to add snare hits and ensure the cymbals are also present.

First, I'll look at the snare. In a typical groove, snares are on beats 2 and 4. I'll add 'S' on those beats. For the cymbals, the crash (C) is usually on beat 1 for emphasis, so I'll add 'O' there. The ride (R) is already present, so I'll keep it as is but maybe adjust it to complement the new elements.

I'll also check the hihat (H) to make sure it's providing a steady rhythm. The original has 'x' on the off-beats, so I'll keep that.

Putting it all together, the new groove should have snares on beats 2 and 4, crash cymbal on beat 1, and a steady hihat. The ride can remain, but I'll adjust it to fit better with the new elements.

I'll structure it like this:

- Kick (K): Keep it as is since the user didn't specify changes.
- Snare (S): Add 'S' on beats 2 and 4.
- Hihat (H): Keep the steady 'x' on off-beats.
- Toms (T): No changes since the user didn't mention them.
- Crash Cymbal (C): Add 'O' on beat 1.
- Ride (R): Adjust to fit the new rhythm, maybe simplify it.

So the final groove will look like:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|S---|----|S---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|x---|x---|x---

This way, the groove now includes both snare and cymbal, fulfilling the user's request.
