Alright, so I'm trying to help edit this drum groove based on the user's request. The user wants the groove to have "not only ride but also cymbal." Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the current groove. Looking at the provided notation:

- **K**: The kick drum has some hits, which is good.
- **S**: The snare drum is mostly inactive except for a sidestick on the third beat.
- **H**: The hihat is active with a pattern of soft closed hits.
- **T**: The toms have a hit on the third beat, which adds some flavor.
- **C**: The crash cymbal is active on every beat, which is quite prominent.
- **R**: The ride cymbal is completely inactive.

The user wants to ensure that both the ride and the crash cymbals are used. Currently, the crash cymbal is heavily used, but the ride isn't used at all. So, the main task is to incorporate the ride cymbal into the groove while keeping the crash cymbal active.

I should think about how to balance both cymbals without making the groove too busy. Maybe alternate between crash and ride hits to create a dynamic rhythm. Let's consider adding ride hits on off-beats or specific beats to complement the crash cymbal.

Looking at the crash cymbal line:
```
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
```
It's active on every beat, which is a bit overwhelming. Perhaps I can reduce the crash cymbal hits to specific beats and introduce ride hits on others.

For the ride cymbal, I can add hits on beats where the crash cymbal isn't hitting, or maybe on the same beats but with a different articulation. Since the ride cymbal can have both open and closed hits, I can use 'O' for open hits on the bell and 'X' or 'x' for closed hits on the bow.

Let me sketch out a possible ride cymbal pattern:
```
R: O---|x---|O---|x---
```
This way, the ride cymbal alternates between open and closed hits, adding variety without clashing with the crash cymbal.

Now, adjusting the crash cymbal to complement this:
```
C: O---|---O|O---|---O
```
By placing crash cymbal hits on beats 1 and 3, and ride cymbal hits on beats 2 and 4 (with different articulations), the groove becomes more balanced and interesting.

I also need to ensure that the other instruments (kick, snare, hihat, toms) still make sense with these changes. The kick and snare provide the backbone, the hihat adds rhythm, and the toms add accents. The cymbals should enhance this without overpowering it.

After making these adjustments, the final groove should have both ride and crash cymbals contributing to the overall rhythm, fulfilling the user's request.
