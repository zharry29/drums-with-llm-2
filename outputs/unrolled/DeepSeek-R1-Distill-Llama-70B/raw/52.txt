Alright, I need to add some hihat to the given drum groove. Let me look at the current groove first. 

The hihat part is currently:
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

This seems like a good foundation, but maybe I can make it more dynamic. I notice that the hihat is already playing on the off-beats, which is great for a rhythmic feel. However, to make it more interesting, I could vary the articulation between open and closed hits.

Looking at the kick and snare, the kick is on beats 1 and 3, and the snare is on beats 2 and 4. The toms are not being used much, so maybe I can add some tom hits to fill in the gaps. 

For the hihat, I'll keep the basic rhythmic pattern but alternate between open (O) and closed (X) hits to add texture. On beats where the kick and snare are playing, I'll use closed hits to keep it tight, and on the off-beats, I'll use open hits to create a sense of movement.

I'll also add some subtle variations in the hihat pattern to match the feel of the song. For example, on the second beat of each measure, I'll switch between closed and open hits to add some variety without disrupting the overall groove.

Finally, I'll make sure that the hihat pattern complements the other instruments and doesn't overpower them. The goal is to enhance the groove without making it too busy.
