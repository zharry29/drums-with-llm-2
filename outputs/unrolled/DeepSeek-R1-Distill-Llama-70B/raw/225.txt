Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I'm given a drum groove and an edit request. The original groove doesn't have any kick drum or tom hits, and the edit request is to add both. 

First, I need to understand the drum notation. It looks like each line represents a different drum or cymbal. The characters in each line show when and how each instrument is played. For example, "O" is a hard hit for the kick drum, and "o" is a soft hit. For the snare, "O" is a hard hit, "o" is a soft open hit, and "X" and "x" are sidestick hits.

Looking at the original groove, the kick drum (K) and tom (T) lines are all "-", meaning they're not played at all. The edit request is to add both kick and tom, so I need to decide where to place these hits.

I'll start by adding kick drum hits. In most music, the kick drum often plays on beats 1 and 3, providing a solid foundation. So, I'll place "O" on the first and third beats of each bar for the kick drum.

Next, for the tom hits, they usually play on off-beats or to add flavor. I'll add a soft tom hit ("o") on the second and fourth beats of the second bar to give it some movement without overpowering the kick.

I'll make sure not to change the other instruments unless necessary. The hihat (H) has a steady rhythm, and the ride cymbal (R) has a nice pattern, so I'll leave those as they are.

Finally, I'll double-check to ensure that the kick and tom hits are added correctly and that the overall groove still flows well together.
