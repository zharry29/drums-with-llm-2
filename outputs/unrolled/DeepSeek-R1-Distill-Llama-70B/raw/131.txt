Alright, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both tom and ride. Let's see what they've provided.

First, I'll look at the original drum groove they've given. It looks like this:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
```

From the notation, I can see that the kick (K) and snare (S) are already being used, along with the ride (R) cymbal. The hihat (H), toms (T), and crash (C) cymbal are mostly silent except for the ride.

The user's edit request is to have the groove include not only tom but also ride. So, I need to ensure that both the tom and ride cymbal are being used in the groove.

Looking at the original, the ride cymbal is already active with a pattern of 'o-O-' in each beat. The tom, however, is completely silent. So, my task is to add some hits on the tom while keeping the ride cymbal active.

I'll start by deciding where to place the tom hits. Since the groove seems to have a steady rhythm with the kick and snare, adding toms on off-beats or specific beats can add texture without clashing. Maybe adding a tom hit on the third note of the second beat and the first note of the fourth beat could work.

Next, I'll check the ride cymbal. It's already being used, but perhaps alternating between open and closed hits can add variety. The ride cymbal in the original is using 'o' and 'O', which correspond to soft and hard open hits. I can introduce some 'X' and 'x' to add closed hits, making the rhythm more dynamic.

I'll also ensure that the crash cymbal remains silent as per the original, unless needed, but since the user didn't mention it, I'll leave it out.

Now, I'll draft the new groove:

- Keep the kick and snare as they are.
- Add tom hits where appropriate.
- Modify the ride cymbal to include both open and closed hits.

So, the edited groove would look like this:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|---O|----|---O
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|X-x-|o-O-|X-x-
```

This way, the toms are added on specific beats, and the ride cymbal has a mix of open and closed hits, making the groove more interesting and fulfilling the user's request.
