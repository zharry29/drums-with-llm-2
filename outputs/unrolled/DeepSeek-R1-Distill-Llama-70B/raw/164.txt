Okay, so I'm trying to help the user edit their drum groove to include both kick and snare. The original groove has a good kick pattern, but the snare is either missing or not prominent enough. The user wants a balance where both kick and snare are featured.

First, I'll look at the kick drum line. It has a pattern like "O--O|----|--O-|----". That's a good foundation. I don't want to remove any of the kick hits because they provide the main pulse. Maybe I can keep them as they are.

Now, looking at the snare drum line, it's mostly empty with some soft hits and sidesticks. To make the snare more prominent, I should add some hard hits. Maybe on beats 2 and 4, which are typical places for snare hits in many music genres. So, I'll change the snare line to "----|O---|----|O---".

The hihat line is empty in the original. Adding hihat will make the groove more dynamic. I'll alternate between open and closed hits to create a rhythmic pattern. Something like "x-X-x|x-X-x|x-X-x|x-X-x".

The toms are also not used in the original. Adding a tom hit on the "and" of beat 3 can add some flavor. So, I'll put an "O" there.

The crash cymbal is already present at the beginning, which is good for accentuating the start. I'll keep that as is.

The ride cymbal isn't used, so I'll leave it empty.

Putting it all together, the new groove should have a balanced mix of kick and snare, with added hihat and a touch of toms and crash for depth.
