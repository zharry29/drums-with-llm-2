Alright, I need to help the user by modifying their drum groove according to their request. The user has provided a specific drum notation format and a current drum groove. They want to remove any cymbal or ride elements from the groove.

First, I'll look at the current groove to understand what needs to be changed. The groove includes kick, snare, hihat, toms, crash cymbal, and ride cymbal. The user wants to eliminate the cymbal and ride cymbal parts.

I'll start by identifying the lines for crash cymbal (C) and ride cymbal (R) in the groove. In the provided groove, the crash cymbal is present on the first beat of each measure, and the ride cymbal is not active. To fulfill the request, I'll set all characters in the crash cymbal and ride cymbal lines to "-", effectively removing their hits.

Next, I'll ensure that the kick, snare, and hihat are preserved as they are, since the user only wants to remove cymbal and ride elements. The toms are already silent in the provided groove, so they remain unchanged.

After making these changes, I'll review the final groove to ensure that it meets the user's requirements and adheres to the notation format. I'll make sure that the kick, snare, and hihat are correctly represented and that all cymbal and ride parts are removed.

Finally, I'll present the revised groove in the specified format, ensuring clarity and correctness.

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern to provide a solid foundation.
2. **Snare Drum (S):** Maintains its backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O").
3. **Hihat (H):** Maintained with a dynamic pattern using "O" and "o".
4. **Toms (T):** Kept silent as per the original groove.
5. **Crash Cymbal (C) and Ride Cymbal (R):** Both removed by setting all characters to "-".

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focused on the kick, snare, and hihat without any cymbal or ride hits.
