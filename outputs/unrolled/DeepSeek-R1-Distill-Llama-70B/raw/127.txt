Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove based on the request. The user provided a drum groove and an edit request. The edit request is to "have not only tom but also ride." 

First, I'll look at the original drum groove they provided. It looks like this:

@@@
K: OOO-|---O|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

I notice that in this groove, the Tom (T) and Ride (R) lines are empty except for the Crash cymbal (C) having some hits. The user wants to add both Tom and Ride to the groove.

So, my goal is to modify the groove to include both Tom and Ride. I'll need to add hits to the T and R lines. 

I'll start by looking at where it makes sense to add Tom hits. Maybe on beats 3 and 4 to add some rhythm. I'll put an 'O' in the third and fourth positions of the T line.

Next, for the Ride cymbal, I'll add some hits to give it a steady rhythm. I'll alternate between 'O' and 'x' in the R line to create a mix of open and closed hits, which should add texture to the groove.

I'll make sure not to interfere with the existing hits in the Kick (K), Snare (S), and Crash (C) lines. The Hihat (H) is empty, so I'll leave it as is unless I think it needs some fills, but the edit request doesn't mention it, so it's safer to leave it.

Putting it all together, I'll update the T and R lines accordingly. I'll double-check to ensure that the additions make sense rhythmically and don't clash with the other instruments.

Finally, I'll present the updated groove with the Tom and Ride added, making sure it's formatted correctly between the @@@ symbols.
