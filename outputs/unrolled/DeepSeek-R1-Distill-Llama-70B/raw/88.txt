Alright, let's tackle this edit request. The user wants to modify the given drum groove by adding both cymbal and tom elements. 

First, I'll look at the original groove provided:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
```

I notice that the Hihat (H) and Tom (T) lines are mostly empty, and the Crash Cymbal (C) is not used. The Ride Cymbal (R) is already present, so that's a good start.

The user wants to add cymbal and tom. Since the Ride is already there, adding Crash Cymbal hits will complement it. For the Toms, I'll introduce some soft hits (o) to add depth without overpowering the main rhythm.

I'll start by adding Crash Cymbal hits on the off-beats to give the groove a brighter feel. Then, I'll add Tom hits on the 8th and 12th notes to create a subtle rhythmic pattern that supports the Kick and Snare.

Here's how I'll modify each line:

- **H (Hihat):** I'll add a steady rhythm with closed hits (x) on the off-beats to maintain a driving feel.
- **T (Toms):** I'll place soft hits (o) on specific notes to add movement without overwhelming the other instruments.
- **C (Crash Cymbal):** I'll add hard hits (O) on the off-beats to accentuate the rhythm and add brightness.

The final modified groove will look like this:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|o---|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
```

This should fulfill the user's request by incorporating both cymbal and tom elements into the groove.
