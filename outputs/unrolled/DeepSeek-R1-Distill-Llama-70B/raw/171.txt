Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove based on their request. The user has provided a drum groove and wants it modified so that it includes not only tom hits but also cymbal hits. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the original drum groove they provided:

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

From this, I can see that the kick drum (K) has a soft hit on the first and third beats, and a slightly offset soft hit on the second and fourth beats. The snare drum (S) has some hard and soft sidestick hits on the second and third beats. The hihat (H) is playing on the offbeats, and the ride cymbal (R) has a mix of open and closed hits.

However, the toms (T) and crash cymbal (C) are completely silent in this groove. The user wants to add cymbal hits, so I need to introduce the crash cymbal and possibly the ride cymbal more prominently. Also, since the user mentioned "not only tom but also cymbal," I should ensure that the toms are included as well.

Wait, in the original groove, the toms are already present in the example they provided earlier, but in the current groove, the toms are silent. So, I need to add tom hits to this groove. Additionally, I need to add cymbal hits, probably crash cymbals on key beats to accentuate the rhythm.

Looking at the original example they provided earlier, the toms had hits on the third beat, so maybe I can incorporate that here. For the crash cymbals, they are often used on beat 1 to mark the start of a new measure or to add accents.

I should also consider the articulations for each instrument. For the crash cymbal (C), 'O' is a hard hit, and 'o' is a soft hit. I'll use 'O' for a strong accent on beat 1.

For the toms (T), 'O' is a hard hit, and 'o' is a soft hit. I'll add a hard hit on the third beat of the first and third bars to match the original example.

Now, I'll go through each instrument and decide where to place the hits:

- **Kick (K):** Keep the existing pattern as it provides a steady foundation.
- **Snare (S):** Keep the sidestick hits to maintain the rhythm.
- **Hihat (H):** Keep the offbeat pattern to maintain the groove.
- **Toms (T):** Add hard hits on the third beat of the first and third bars.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Add a hard hit on the first beat of each bar to add accents.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Keep the existing pattern as it adds movement without overpowering the groove.

Putting it all together, I'll update the groove accordingly.
