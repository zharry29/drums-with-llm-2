Alright, so I need to add some cymbal to this drum groove. Let's see what the current groove looks like. The Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash cymbal (C), and Ride cymbal (R) are all set up in the notation.

Looking at the given groove, the Crash cymbal (C) and Ride cymbal (R) parts are empty or minimal. The user wants more cymbal in the groove, so I should focus on adding hits to C and maybe R.

First, I'll look at where it makes sense to add cymbal hits. Typically, cymbals are used to accentuate beats or add flavor at the start or end of phrases. In this groove, the first beat of each measure is a good place to add a crash cymbal for emphasis.

So, I'll add an 'O' in the C line at the beginning of each measure. That should give a nice, crisp sound to start each measure. Also, I'll make sure the Ride cymbal continues its pattern to keep the rhythm flowing smoothly.

I'll go through each measure and add the 'O' in the C line where it feels natural. This should enhance the overall sound without overpowering the other instruments.
