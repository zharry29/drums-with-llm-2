Alright, so I need to help the user create a drum groove without any cymbal or ride. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided. It looks like it's a 4/4 time signature with 16 16th notes per bar. Each line represents a different drum or cymbal, and each character shows what's played on that 16th note. A '-' means it's not played, while other characters represent different hits or articulations.

The user wants to remove any cymbal or ride hits. Looking at the original groove, I see that the ride and crash cymbal are already not present, so there's not much to remove there. The main elements are the kick, snare, hihat, and toms.

I'll focus on keeping the kick and snare as the primary elements. The hihat can stay since it's not a cymbal. I'll make sure the ride and crash cymbal lines are all '-' to ensure they're silent.

Finalizing the groove, I'll ensure it's balanced and maintains a good rhythm without the cymbals or ride.

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This groove now features:
- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original soft hit pattern to provide a subtle foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Maintains its dynamic pattern with "X".
- **Hihat (H):** Maintained with soft closed hits ("x") on beats 2 and 4.
- **Toms (T):** Kept silent as per the original groove.
- **Crash Cymbal (C) and Ride Cymbal (R):** Both removed by setting all characters to "-".

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focused on the kick and snare without any cymbal or ride hits.
