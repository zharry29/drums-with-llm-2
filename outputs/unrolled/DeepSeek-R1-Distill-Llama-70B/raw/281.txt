Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants the groove to have not only snare but also ride. So, I need to ensure both the snare and ride cymbal are prominently featured in the final pattern.

First, I'll look at the original groove provided:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

I notice that the snare drum (S) is already present on beats 2 and 4, which is good. However, the ride cymbal (R) isn't being used at all. My task is to incorporate the ride cymbal into the groove while keeping the snare drum prominent.

I'll start by adding the ride cymbal. The ride cymbal typically plays steady rhythms, often on offbeats or every eighth note. To complement the snare, I'll have the ride play on the offbeats with soft closed hits (x) and maybe some harder hits (X) for accentuation.

Next, I'll review the hihat (H) pattern. The original hihat pattern is quite busy with a mix of open and closed hits. To make the ride cymbal stand out, I might simplify the hihat to closed hits (x) on every eighth note. This way, the ride cymbal can take the lead without clashing with the hihat.

The kick drum (K) and crash cymbal (C) seem fine as they are, providing the necessary accents and foundation. I'll leave them unchanged to maintain the song's structure.

Now, I'll sketch out the new pattern:

- **Kick Drum (K):** Keep the original pattern to maintain the song's foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Keep the backbeats on beats 2 and 4 to ensure the snare is prominent.
- **Hihat (H):** Simplify to closed hits (x) on every eighth note to support the rhythm without overpowering the ride.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Add soft closed hits (x) on the offbeats and harder hits (X) on key beats to make it stand out.
- **Toms (T):** Keep them out of the pattern as per the original.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Keep the crash on beat 1 to maintain the accent.

Putting it all together, the revised groove should look like this:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
R: x---|X---|x---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
```

This pattern ensures that both the snare and ride cymbal are featured prominently, with the ride cymbal adding texture and rhythm without overshadowing the snare. The hihat provides a steady foundation, and the kick and crash maintain the song's structure.

I think this should meet the user's request effectively.

To fulfill the user's request to include both snare and ride cymbal in the drum groove, I've revised the original pattern to enhance the ride cymbal's presence while maintaining the snare drum's prominence. Here's the final version:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
R: x---|X---|x---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern, playing on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits ("O") and a soft hit ("o") on beat 2.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Retains its backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O").
- **Hihat (H):** Simplified to soft closed hits ("x") on every eighth note, providing a steady rhythm without overpowering the ride cymbal.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with soft closed hits ("x") on the offbeats and harder hits ("X") on key beats to make it stand out and add texture.
- **Toms (T):** Kept silent as per the original pattern.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Maintains its accent on beat 1 with a hard hit ("O").

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and ride cymbal featured prominently.
