Alright, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both tom and ride. Let's start by understanding the current groove they provided.

Looking at the drum notation, each line represents a different drum or cymbal. The user wants to add more tom and ride elements. I see that the tom is already present in the third beat, but it's only hit once. To make it more prominent, I can add another tom hit in the fourth beat. 

For the ride cymbal, it's currently not being used at all. I'll need to add some ride hits to give the groove more texture. Maybe I can add ride hits in the second and fourth beats to complement the existing rhythm.

I should also check the other instruments to ensure the additions don't clash. The kick and snare are already set, and the hihat is providing a steady rhythm. Adding toms and rides should enhance the overall feel without making it too busy.

So, I'll update the tom line to include another hit and add ride hits where appropriate. This should fulfill the user's request to have both tom and ride in the groove.
