Okay, I need to help the user by editing their drum groove according to their request. They don't want any kick or cymbal in the final groove. Let me look at the original groove they provided.

Original Groove:
```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

The user wants to remove both kick and cymbal. So, I'll need to set the K (Kick), C (Crash), and R (Ride) lines to all "-" to silence them.

Looking at the Kick line: It has "O---|----|O---|----". I'll change this to "----|----|----|----".

For the Cymbals, both C and R are already all "-", so I don't need to change those.

The Snare (S) and Hihat (H) can stay as they are since the user didn't mention removing them.

So, the final groove should have K, C, and R lines set to all "-", while keeping S and H as they are.

Final Groove:
```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This way, the kick and cymbals are removed, and the snare and hihat remain.

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Kick Drum (K):** Removed by setting all characters to "-".
2. **Snare Drum (S):** Maintains its backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O").
3. **Hihat (H):** Maintained its dynamic pattern with hard closed hits ("X").
4. **Toms (T):** Kept silent as per the original groove.
5. **Crash Cymbal (C) and Ride Cymbal (R):** Both removed by setting all characters to "-".

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focused on the snare and hihat without any kick or cymbal hits.
