Alright, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both hihat and tom. Let me start by understanding the problem. The user provided a drum groove in a specific notation and wants to modify it to include both hihat and tom. 

First, I'll review the notation to make sure I understand each part. The notation has lines for different drum instruments, and each character represents a 16th note. The user's current groove doesn't have any hihat or tom hits, so I need to add those.

I'll look at the hihat line. It's currently all dashes, meaning it's not being played. I'll need to add some hits there. Hihat notation uses 'x' for soft closed hits and 'X' for hard closed hits. Maybe I'll add a steady rhythm with 'x's to give it a soft, closed feel.

Next, the tom line is also all dashes. Toms are usually used for accents, so I'll add some 'o's for soft hits on the off-beats to give the groove some movement.

I'll go through each beat and decide where to place the hihat and tom hits. I'll make sure the hihat has a consistent pattern and the toms add some interest without overpowering the kick and snare.

After making these changes, I'll double-check the notation to ensure it fits the 16 characters per line and that the beats are correctly separated by '|'. I'll also make sure that the articulations make sense for each instrument.

Finally, I'll present the updated groove with the hihat and tom added, ensuring it's formatted correctly between '@@@' as the user requested.
