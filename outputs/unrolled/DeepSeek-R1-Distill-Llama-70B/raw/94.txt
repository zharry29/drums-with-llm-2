Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove by adding more hihat and keeping the kick drum. Let's look at the original groove they provided:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user wants to enhance the groove with more hihat and keep the kick drum. The hihat line already has a good pattern with "X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-", so maybe I can add some variations to make it more dynamic.

I notice that the kick drum (K) has a solid pattern, so I'll keep that as is. For the hihat, perhaps adding some open and closed hits in different positions could add texture. I'll consider adding "O" for open hits and "X" for closed hits in different beats to create a more interesting rhythm.

I'll go through each beat and see where I can add or modify the hihat hits without making it too busy. Maybe alternating between open and closed hits on different beats could work well. I'll also make sure to maintain the overall feel and not clash with the snare or other instruments.

After making these adjustments, I'll review the pattern to ensure it flows well and meets the user's request. I'll make sure to keep the kick drum prominent as requested and enhance the hihat presence effectively.
