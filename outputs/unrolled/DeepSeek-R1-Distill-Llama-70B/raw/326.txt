Alright, so the user wants me to edit a drum groove by removing both the ride and snare drums. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided.

Looking at the original groove, the kick drum (K) has a pattern of "o---|--o-|o---|--o-". It uses soft hits, which is a bit unusual since kicks are usually hard hits. The snare drum (S) has "----|X---|--X-|----", which means it's using sidesticks on beats 2 and 4. The hihat (H) is "----|x---|----|x---", playing soft closed hits on beats 2 and 4. The toms (T) are silent, the crash cymbal (C) is also silent, and the ride cymbal (R) has a dynamic pattern with both soft and hard hits.

The user's request is to remove both the ride and snare drums. So, I need to set all their hits to "-" to silence them. That means the snare line will become "----|----|----|----", and the ride line will also be "----|----|----|----".

Now, I need to ensure that the kick and hihat can carry the rhythm on their own. The kick is currently using soft hits, which might not provide enough punch without the snare. Maybe I should consider changing the kick hits to hard hits ("O") for a stronger foundation. However, the user didn't specify changing the kick, so I'll keep it as is unless necessary.

The hihat is already providing a steady rhythm, so it should be fine. I'll keep it unchanged. The crash cymbal and toms are already silent, so no changes are needed there.

Putting it all together, the final groove will have the kick and hihat only, with the snare and ride silenced. This should meet the user's request of having no ride or snare in the groove.

Here is the edited drum groove with the ride and snare removed:

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This groove now features:
- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original soft hit pattern.
- **Hihat (H):** Continues with soft closed hits on beats 2 and 4.
- **Snare Drum (S), Toms (T), Crash Cymbal (C), and Ride Cymbal (R):** All silenced as per the request.

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focusing on the kick and hihat.
