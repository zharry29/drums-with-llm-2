Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both tom and snare. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

First, looking at the original groove, I see that the kick drum (K) is not present, the snare drum (S) is also not played, the hihat (H) has a steady pattern on the second and fourth beats, the toms (T) are not played, the crash cymbal (C) is absent, and the ride cymbal (R) has a specific pattern with both open and closed hits.

The edit request is to have "not only tom but also snare." So, the user wants both the tom and snare drums to be included in the groove. 

I'll start by adding snare hits. Typically, snares are played on beats 2 and 4, so I'll add soft open hits (o) on those beats. This will give a subtle backbeat without overpowering the rest of the groove.

Next, I'll incorporate the tom hits. Since the original groove didn't have any, I'll add them on the off-beats to create some movement and interest. I'll use soft hits (o) on the toms to keep it balanced.

I'll leave the hihat and ride cymbal patterns as they are to maintain the rhythmic foundation. The crash cymbal isn't necessary in this edit, so I'll keep it out.

Putting it all together, I'll update the snare and tom lines while keeping the rest of the groove intact. This should fulfill the user's request by adding both snare and tom hits to the existing pattern.
