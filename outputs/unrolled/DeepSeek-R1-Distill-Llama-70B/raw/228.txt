Okay, so I need to help edit this drum groove to include both kick and tom. Let me start by understanding the original groove and what needs to be changed.

Looking at the original drum groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I see that the kick drum (K) has hits on the first and third beats, with some variations. The snare drum (S) is also present, which is good. The hihat (H) has a steady rhythm, which is nice. However, the tom (T) isn't being used, and the crash (C) and ride (R) cymbals are also absent.

The edit request is to have not only kick but also tom. So, I need to add tom hits to the groove. I should make sure that the tom hits complement the kick drum and don't clash with it. Maybe I can add a soft hit on the tom (using 'o') on beats where the kick isn't playing, to add some depth without overpowering the kick.

I'll go through each beat and decide where to place the tom hits. Let's see:

- Beat 1: Kick is already playing a soft 'o' on the second 16th note. Maybe I can add a soft tom hit on the fourth 16th note to add some movement.
- Beat 2: Kick is playing a hard 'O' on the first 16th note. I can add a soft tom hit on the third 16th note to fill in the gap.
- Beat 3: Kick is playing a hard 'O' on the fourth 16th note. I'll add a soft tom hit on the second 16th note to create a nice rhythm.
- Beat 4: Kick is playing a hard 'O' on the third 16th note. I'll add a soft tom hit on the first 16th note to start the beat.

By adding these soft tom hits, the groove will have more texture without overpowering the kick drum. I'll make sure the tom hits are soft ('o') to keep the overall balance.

Now, I'll update the tom line accordingly:

T: o---|---o|o---|o---

This way, the tom adds a subtle rhythm that supports the kick drum without clashing. I'll keep the rest of the groove the same to maintain consistency.

Finally, I'll present the updated groove with the added tom hits.
