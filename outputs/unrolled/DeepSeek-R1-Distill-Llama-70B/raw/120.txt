Alright, so I've got this drum groove that I need to edit. The user wants the groove to have not only ride but also cymbal. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the original groove provided:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

From this, I can see that the Kick (K), Snare (S), and Hihat (H) are being used, but the Tom (T), Crash cymbal (C), and Ride cymbal (R) are not. The user specifically wants to add both Ride and Cymbal elements to the groove. 

Now, I need to understand what each instrument represents and how they're notated:

- **Kick (K):** O for a hard hit, o for a soft hit.
- **Snare (S):** O for a hard hit, o for a soft open hit, X and x for hard and soft sidestick hits.
- **Hihat (H):** O for a hard open hit, o for a soft open hit, X and x for hard and soft closed hits.
- **Tom (T):** O for a hard hit, o for a soft hit.
- **Crash cymbal (C):** O for a hard hit, o for a soft hit.
- **Ride cymbal (R):** O for a hard open hit on the bell, o for a soft open hit on the bell, X and x for hard and soft closed hits on the bow.

The user wants to add both Ride and Cymbal. From the original groove, I notice that the Crash cymbal (C) is not used at all, and the Ride cymbal (R) is also not present. So, I need to incorporate these into the groove.

Let's think about where to place the Ride and Crash cymbals to enhance the groove without making it too busy. Typically, the Crash cymbal is used to accentuate certain beats or to add color at specific points, like at the beginning or before a fill. The Ride cymbal is often used to maintain a steady rhythm, especially in jazz or more complex time signatures.

Looking at the original groove, the Kick is on beats 1 and 3, with some activity on the "and" of beat 2. The Snare is on beats 2 and 4, with some ghost notes (the o's) to add texture. The Hihat is playing a steady 16th-note rhythm, which is common in many genres.

To incorporate the Ride cymbal, I can add it on certain beats to add rhythmic interest. Maybe on beats 1 and 3, alternating with the Kick, to create a more driving rhythm. For the Crash cymbal, I can add it on beat 1 of the first measure to give a strong accent at the beginning of the bar.

I also notice that the Tom (T) is not used in the original groove. The user didn't specifically mention adding Tom, but since the instruction is about adding Ride and Cymbal, I'll focus on those. However, adding a Tom hit could add more depth, but I'll stick to the user's request.

Now, let's plan the changes:

1. **Crash Cymbal (C):** Add an 'O' on the first beat of the first measure to give a strong accent.
2. **Ride Cymbal (R):** Add 'O's on beats 1 and 3 of each measure to create a steady rhythm alongside the Kick.

Let's apply these changes to the original groove:

- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Change from `----|----|----|----` to `O---|----|----|----`.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Change from `----|----|----|----` to `O---|----|O---|----`.

The updated groove would look like this:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|O---|----
```

This way, the groove now includes both the Ride and Crash cymbals, enhancing the rhythm and adding the requested elements without overcrowding the pattern. The Crash on the first beat gives a strong accent, and the Ride on beats 1 and 3 adds a steady rhythmic element that complements the Kick drum.

I think this should meet the user's request effectively.
