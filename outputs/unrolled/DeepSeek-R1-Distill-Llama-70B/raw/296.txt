Alright, I need to help the user by editing their drum groove to include both hihat and ride cymbal. Let's break this down.

First, I'll look at the original drum groove they provided:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

I notice that the hihat is already present with a pattern of "X-x-" on every beat, which is good. However, the ride cymbal is completely silent. My task is to add the ride cymbal without losing the hihat's presence.

I'll start by deciding where to place the ride cymbal hits. Since the hihat is already on every offbeat, I'll place the ride cymbal on the onbeats to complement it. I'll use "X" for hard hits on the ride to make it stand out.

Next, I'll adjust the hihat pattern slightly to ensure it doesn't clash with the ride. Maybe I'll make the hihat a bit softer on the onbeats where the ride is playing. I'll use "x" for softer hits on the hihat.

I'll also check the other instruments to make sure they're balanced. The kick drum has a solid pattern, and the snare is providing good backbeats. I'll leave those as they are.

Putting it all together, the new pattern should have the hihat and ride cymbal working together to create a dynamic rhythm. I'll make sure the ride cymbal is prominent but doesn't overpower the rest of the groove.

Finally, I'll review the changes to ensure everything flows well and meets the user's request.

Here's the revised drum groove with both hihat and ride cymbal prominently featured:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: X---|X---|X---|X---
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Hihat (H):** Changed to soft closed hits ("x") to complement the ride cymbal.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with hard hits ("X") on the onbeats to add texture and interest.
- **Kick Drum (K) and Snare Drum (S):** Kept unchanged to preserve the foundational rhythm.
- **Toms (T) and Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept silent to focus on the hihat and ride cymbal.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both hihat and ride cymbal featured prominently.
