Alright, I need to help the user create a drum groove that includes both hihat and ride cymbal. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user provided a drum groove and wants it edited to include both hihat and ride. The original groove has hihat but not ride. I need to add ride cymbal hits without disrupting the existing rhythm.

First, I'll look at the original groove:

- **Kick Drum (K):** O---|---o|O-O-|----
- **Snare Drum (S):** ----|O---|----|O---
- **Hihat (H):** --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** O---|----|----|----
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** ----|----|----|----

I notice that the hihat is already present with a mix of soft and hard hits. The ride cymbal is currently not used. My goal is to incorporate ride cymbal hits to complement the hihat.

I'll start by deciding where to add the ride cymbal. Since the hihat is on the offbeats, I can add ride hits on the beats or alternate with the hihat to create a layered rhythm. I'll use "X" for hard ride hits and "x" for soft ones to add dynamics.

Looking at the hihat pattern (--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-), I can add ride cymbal hits on the first and third beats of each measure. This will create a balanced rhythm without clashing with the hihat.

So, the ride cymbal pattern will be:

- **Ride Cymbal (R):** X---|X---|X---|X---

This way, the ride cymbal plays hard hits on the first beat of each measure, complementing the hihat's offbeat pattern.

I'll keep the rest of the groove the same to maintain the original feel. Now, I'll compile the final groove with the added ride cymbal.

Here's the final groove:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: X---|X---|X---|X---
```

This revised groove includes both hihat and ride cymbal, providing a dynamic and balanced rhythm section.

Here's the final drum groove with both hihat and ride cymbal prominently featured:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: X---|X---|X---|X---
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Hihat (H):** Maintained with a mix of soft ("o") and hard ("O") hits, providing a dynamic rhythm.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with hard hits ("X") on the first beat of each measure, complementing the hihat and adding texture.
- **Kick Drum (K):** Retained its original pattern, playing on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits ("O") and a soft hit ("o") on beat 2.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Maintained its backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O").
- **Toms (T):** Kept silent to focus on the hihat and ride cymbal.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Maintained its accent on beat 1 with a hard hit ("O").

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both hihat and ride cymbal featured prominently.
