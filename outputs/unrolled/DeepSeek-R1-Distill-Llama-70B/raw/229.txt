Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both kick and tom. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

First, looking at the original drum groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
S: ----|X---|--X-|----  
H: ----|x---|----|x---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-  

I can see that the kick drum (K) has a steady pattern with hits on the 1st and 3rd beats in the first and third bars. The snare drum (S) is played on the 2nd and 4th beats in the second and fourth bars. The hihat (H) has a basic 8th-note pattern, and the ride cymbal (R) alternates between open and closed hits. The toms (T) and crash cymbal (C) are not played in this groove.

The user's edit request is to have a groove that includes not only kick but also tom. So, I need to add tom hits to this pattern. 

I should consider where to place the tom hits to make the groove sound good. Toms are often used to add flavor and rhythm, especially on off-beats or to build tension. Since the kick is already on beats 1 and 3, adding toms on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4 could work well. This will create a syncopated rhythm that complements the kick.

Looking at the original pattern, I'll add a soft hit (o) on the 8th note after the second beat and a hard hit (O) on the 8th note after the fourth beat in the tom line. This will give the groove some movement without overpowering the kick.

So, the updated tom line will look like:

T: ----|---o|----|---O

I'll keep the rest of the groove the same to maintain consistency. Now, I'll put it all together in the drum notation format.
