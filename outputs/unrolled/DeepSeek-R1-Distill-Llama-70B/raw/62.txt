Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove by adding more cymbal hits. The user provided a drum groove with the following instruments: Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash cymbal (C), and Ride cymbal (R). The current groove has the kick and hihat, but the user wants to add cymbals.

First, I'll look at the current groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-  
S: ----|----|S---|----  
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-  
T: ----|----|---O|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

I notice that the crash cymbal is already being used on every beat, which is good. The ride cymbal isn't being used, so that's an area to add cymbal hits. I'll consider adding ride hits on off-beats to create a more dynamic rhythm.

I'll add ride hits on the 8th and 12th 16th notes in each beat to complement the kick and hihat. This should give the groove more texture without overpowering the existing elements. I'll make sure to use 'x' for soft closed hits on the ride to keep it subtle.

The final groove will have the ride cymbal added, enhancing the overall feel without changing the foundational rhythm.
