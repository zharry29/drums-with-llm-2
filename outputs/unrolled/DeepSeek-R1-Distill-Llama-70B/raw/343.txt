Alright, so I'm trying to help the user create a drum groove without any snare or cymbals. Let's see, the user provided a drum notation system, and they have a specific groove they want to modify. They want to remove both the snare and cymbals from the groove.

First, I need to understand the notation system they're using. It looks like each line represents a different drum or cymbal, with characters indicating when and how to hit them. For example, "O" is a hard hit, "o" is a soft hit, and "-" means no hit. The user also provided a specific groove that they want to edit.

Looking at the original groove, I see that there are lines for Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash Cymbal (C), and Ride Cymbal (R). The user wants to remove both the snare and cymbals, which means I need to eliminate any hits on the Snare (S), Crash Cymbal (C), and Ride Cymbal (R) lines.

So, I'll start by setting all characters on the Snare (S), Crash Cymbal (C), and Ride Cymbal (R) lines to "-", which means no hits. That leaves only the Kick (K), Hihat (H), and Toms (T) lines. But wait, the user didn't mention removing the Hihat or Toms, so I should leave those as they are unless instructed otherwise.

Let me double-check the edit request to make sure I'm addressing it correctly. The user said, "I don't want any snare or cymbal." Cymbals include both Crash and Ride, so I need to make sure those are removed. The Hihat is technically part of the cymbal family, but in drum notation, it's often treated separately. However, since the user specifically mentioned "cymbal," I should confirm whether they want the Hihat removed as well. But based on the edit, it seems they only want to remove the snare and cymbals, so I'll keep the Hihat as is.

Now, I'll go through each line and set the Snare, Crash, and Ride lines to all "-", ensuring no hits are present. The Kick, Hihat, and Toms can remain unchanged. This will result in a groove that features only the Kick, Hihat, and Toms, fulfilling the user's request to remove the snare and cymbals.

Finally, I'll present the updated groove, making sure it's formatted correctly within the "@@@" symbols as the user instructed.

```
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern to provide a solid foundation.
2. **Snare Drum (S):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".
3. **Hihat (H):** Kept silent as per the original groove.
4. **Toms (T):** Maintained the original pattern for added flavor.
5. **Crash Cymbal (C):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".
6. **Ride Cymbal (R):** Removed all hits by setting all characters to "-".

This arrangement creates a rhythm focused on the kick and toms without any snare or cymbal hits.
