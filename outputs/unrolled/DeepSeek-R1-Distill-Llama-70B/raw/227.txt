Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm supposed to edit a given drum groove to include both kick and tom, based on the user's request. First, I need to understand the drum notation provided.

Looking at the notation, each line represents a different drum or cymbal. The characters in each line correspond to 16th notes, and each beat is separated by a "|". The letters represent different hits, with "O" being a hard hit and "o" being a soft hit. For the snare drum, "X" and "x" are sidestick hits.

The original groove provided is:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

I need to ensure that the kick drum (K) and tom (T) are both present in the groove. The kick drum is already present, so I'll focus on adding the tom.

Looking at the T line, it's all "-", meaning the tom isn't being played. I'll add some hits to the tom line. I'll choose the 5th and 13th positions to add some "O" hits, making it:

T: ----|----|O---|----|O---

I'll update the T line accordingly. The rest of the groove seems fine, so I'll keep the other lines as they are.
