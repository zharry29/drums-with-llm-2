Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has given me a drum groove and wants me to edit it to include both hihat and tom. The original groove doesn't have any hihat or tom hits, so I need to add those in while keeping the rest of the groove intact.

First, I'll look at the original groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|----  
R: ----|----|----|----  

Okay, the kick (K) and snare (S) are already there, and the crash cymbal (C) is on the first beat. But there's nothing for hihat (H) or tom (T). My task is to add hihat and tom hits without disrupting the existing rhythm.

I'll start with the hihat. Since it's a 16th-note rhythm, I'll add a steady pattern. Maybe something like "x-x-" to give it a driving feel. I'll make sure it's consistent across all beats.

Next, for the tom, I'll add some hits to complement the kick and snare. Maybe on the off-beats or where it adds some flavor without clashing with the existing hits. I'll use "o" for soft hits to keep it subtle.

So, updating the hihat line to have a steady rhythm and adding some tom hits on the off-beats should do the trick. I'll make sure the crash cymbal stays on the first beat to keep the structure intact.

Let me put it all together:

K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-  
T: ----|---o|----|---o  
C: O---|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----  

I think this should fulfill the request. The hihat is now playing a steady rhythm, and the tom adds some texture on the off-beats without overpowering the main rhythm.
