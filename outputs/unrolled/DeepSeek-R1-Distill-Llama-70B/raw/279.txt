Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both snare and ride cymbal. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

The original groove has the following patterns:

- **Kick Drum (K):** Soft hits on every other beat.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Sidestick hits on beats 2 and 4.
- **Hihat (H):** Soft closed hits on beats 2 and 4.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** A mix of soft and hard closed hits, creating a dynamic rhythm.

The user wants the groove to have not only snare but also ride cymbal. This means I need to enhance the ride cymbal's presence while keeping the snare drum's role prominent.

First, I'll look at the ride cymbal (R) in the original groove. It has a pattern of soft (x) and hard (X) closed hits. To make it more prominent, I can increase the number of hard hits and maybe add some on the offbeats to give it more drive.

Next, the snare drum (S) is using sidesticks (X and x). To make it stand out more, I can add actual snare hits (O or o) on the backbeats (beats 2 and 4). This will give the groove a stronger backbeat and make the snare more audible.

I'll also check the hihat (H) pattern. It's currently playing soft closed hits on beats 2 and 4. To complement the ride cymbal, I can make the hihat pattern steadier, maybe playing on every eighth note with a mix of soft and hard hits.

The kick drum (K) is playing soft hits. To make the groove more driving, I can add more hard hits (O) on the kick drum, perhaps on beats 1 and 3.

I'll also ensure that the crash cymbal (C) and toms (T) are either removed or minimized since the focus is on snare and ride.

Putting it all together, I'll revise each instrument's pattern to emphasize both snare and ride cymbal, ensuring a balanced and dynamic rhythm section.

To fulfill the user's request to include both snare and ride cymbal in the drum groove, I've revised the original pattern to enhance the ride cymbal's presence while maintaining the snare drum's prominence. Here's the final version:

```
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: O---|X---|O---|X---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
R: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains soft hits ("o") on every other beat for a subtle foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Enhanced with hard hits ("O") on beats 1 and 3, and sidestick hits ("X") on beats 2 and 4, making it more prominent.
- **Hihat (H):** Added with soft closed hits ("x") on every eighth note, providing a steady rhythm.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with hard closed hits ("X") on every eighth note, complementing the hihat and adding dynamic interest.
- **Toms (T) and Crash Cymbal (C):** Removed to focus on the snare and ride cymbal.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and ride cymbal featured prominently.
