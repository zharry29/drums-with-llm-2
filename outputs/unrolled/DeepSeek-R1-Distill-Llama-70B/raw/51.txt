Okay, I need to help the user add some hihat to their drum groove. Let me look at the provided notation and the edit request.

The user's current groove has the hihat part as "x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-", which is a steady eighth-note pattern. They want to add more hihat, so maybe I can make it busier or add some syncopation.

I should consider varying the hihat hits. Perhaps adding some off-beat hits or mixing open and closed hits would make it more interesting. I'll check the notation for hihat: O is a hard open hit, o is a soft open hit, X and x are hard and soft closed hits.

I'll start by adding some variation in the first beat. Maybe an open hit on the second note. So, the first beat becomes "x-O-".

Next, I'll look at the second beat. Adding a closed hit on the third note could work, making it "x-X-".

I'll continue this pattern for the third and fourth beats, alternating between open and closed hits to create a dynamic rhythm. So, the hihat line becomes "x-O-|x-X-|x-O-|x-X-".

I'll make sure this fits with the rest of the groove and doesn't clash with other instruments. The kick, snare, toms, crash, and ride parts seem fine, so I'll leave them as they are.

Finally, I'll update the hihat line in the groove and present the new notation to the user.
