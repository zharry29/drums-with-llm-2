Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both hihat and ride cymbal. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided.

Looking at the original groove:

- **Kick Drum (K):** Soft hits on every other beat, which is a bit subtle.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Sidestick hits on beats 1 and 3, which adds some flavor.
- **Hihat (H):** Only on beats 2 and 4 with soft closed hits, pretty minimal.
- **Toms (T):** Not used at all.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Not used.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** A dynamic pattern with both soft and hard closed hits, which is already prominent.

The user wants the groove to have not only hihat but also ride cymbal. So, I need to enhance the hihat's presence while maintaining the ride cymbal's role.

First, I'll look at the hihat. It's currently only on beats 2 and 4. To make it more prominent, I'll add hihat hits on every offbeat. This means adding soft closed hits ("x") on the 8th and 12th notes. This will create a steady rhythm without overpowering the ride cymbal.

Next, the ride cymbal is already there with a good mix of soft and hard hits. I'll keep it as is to maintain its dynamic feel.

I'll also consider the kick and snare drums. The kick is soft, which might not provide enough foundation. I'll change the kick hits to hard hits ("O") on beats 1 and 3 to give it more presence. The snare has sidesticks, which is interesting, but to make it more traditional, I'll add backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O").

I'll keep the toms and crash cymbal silent to keep the focus on the hihat and ride cymbal.

Putting it all together, the new groove will have a solid kick, prominent snare, steady hihat, and dynamic ride cymbal. This should meet the user's request effectively.

Here's the revised drum groove with both hihat and ride cymbal prominently featured:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
R: x-X-x|X-x-X|x-X-x|X-x-X
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Kick Drum (K):** Changed to hard hits ("O") on beats 1 and 3 for a stronger foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Added hard hits ("O") on beats 2 and 4 for a more traditional backbeat.
- **Hihat (H):** Added soft closed hits ("x") on every offbeat to create a steady rhythm.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Maintained with a dynamic pattern alternating between soft ("x") and hard ("X") closed hits for texture.
- **Toms (T) and Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept silent to focus on the hihat and ride cymbal.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both hihat and ride cymbal featured prominently.
