Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a drum groove and an edit request. My task is to modify the groove according to the request and present the final result in the specified notation.

First, I'll start by understanding the drum notation provided. Each line represents a different drum or cymbal, and each character corresponds to a 16th note. The symbols denote different articulations depending on the instrument. For example, 'O' on the kick drum is a hard hit, while 'o' is a soft hit. Similarly, for the ride cymbal, 'O' is a hard open hit on the bell, and 'X' is a hard closed hit on the bow.

Now, looking at the given drum groove:

```
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

The edit request is to have "not only tom but also ride." This means I need to ensure that both the Tom (T) and Ride (R) are included in the groove. Currently, the Tom is active, but the Ride is not used at all. My goal is to add Ride hits to the groove without removing or significantly altering the existing Tom pattern.

I'll start by examining the current pattern. The Kick (K) is active on beats 1 and 2 of the first measure and on beat 4 of the second measure. The Snare (S) is active on beat 3 of the second measure. The Hihat (H) is inactive throughout. The Tom (T) has a repeating pattern of "O-o-" in each beat. The Crash (C) and Ride (R) are inactive.

To incorporate the Ride, I'll add 'O's or 'X's to the Ride line. Since the Ride can be played on the bell (O or o) or the bow (X or x), I'll choose 'O' for a hard open hit on the bell to keep it prominent and consistent with the Tom hits.

I'll add Ride hits on beats where the Tom is already active to create a complementary rhythm. This way, the Tom and Ride can play off each other without clashing. I'll place 'O's in the Ride line on beats 1 and 3 of each measure to match the Tom's pattern, ensuring they don't overlap in a way that might sound messy.

Here's how the modified groove looks:

```
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|----|O---|----
```

In this version, the Ride (R) has 'O's on beats 1 and 3, mirroring the Tom's pattern and enhancing the rhythmic texture without overpowering the existing elements. The Kick and Snare patterns remain unchanged to maintain the song's structure and feel.

I'll double-check to ensure that the Ride hits are placed correctly and that they complement the Tom hits without causing any unintended rhythmic conflicts. This should fulfill the edit request by including both Tom and Ride in the groove.
