Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both tom and hihat. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user provided a drum groove that currently doesn't have any tom hits, and they want to add toms while also ensuring the hihat is included. From the initial groove, I can see that the hihat is already present, so my main task is to add tom hits without removing the hihat.

First, I'll look at the given drum groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-  
S: ----|----|S---|----  
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-  
T: ----|----|---O|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

I notice that the hihat (H) is already active throughout the bar, which is good. The user wants to add toms, so I'll focus on the T line.

In the current T line, there's a single 'O' in the third beat. To enhance the groove, I can add more tom hits. I'll consider adding a soft hit 'o' in the second beat and another 'O' in the fourth beat to create a more dynamic rhythm.

So, the updated T line would look like:  
T: ----|---o|---O|---O  

This way, the toms are added without overpowering the existing hihat pattern. The crash cymbal (C) is already present, so I'll leave that as is. The kick (K) and snare (S) can remain unchanged to maintain the original feel.

Putting it all together, the final groove will have both tom and hihat, fulfilling the user's request.
