Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants a groove that includes both snare and ride cymbal. I need to make sure both are prominent without making the rhythm too busy.

First, I'll look at the original groove:

```
K: OOO-|---O|OOO-|---O
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

The kick drum (K) is pretty busy with "OOO-" and "OOO-" patterns. Maybe I can simplify it to make room for the ride cymbal. Let's try having the kick on beats 1 and 3 with "O---".

The snare drum (S) is already on beats 2 and 4 with "O---", which is good. I'll keep that as it is.

The hihat (H) is currently not used. Adding soft closed hits ("x---") on every offbeat will provide a steady rhythm without overpowering the ride.

The ride cymbal (R) needs to be prominent. I'll add a mix of soft and hard closed hits, maybe alternating between "x" and "X" to add texture.

The toms (T) and crash cymbal (C) can stay as they are, but I might adjust the crash to accentuate the start of each measure.

Putting it all together, here's the revised groove:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
R: x-X-x|X-x-X|x-X-x|X-x-X
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
```

This should give a balanced rhythm with both snare and ride cymbal featured prominently.

Here's the revised drum groove with both snare and ride cymbal prominently featured:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
R: x-X-x|X-x-X|x-X-x|X-x-X
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Kick Drum (K):** Simplified to play on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits ("O"), providing a solid foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Maintains its backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O").
- **Hihat (H):** Added with soft closed hits ("x") on every eighth note, providing a steady rhythm.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with a dynamic pattern alternating between soft ("x") and hard ("X") closed hits, making it stand out and add texture.
- **Toms (T):** Kept silent to keep the focus on the snare and ride cymbal.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Added on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits ("O"), providing strong accents.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and ride cymbal featured prominently.
