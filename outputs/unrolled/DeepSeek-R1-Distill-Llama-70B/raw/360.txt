Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to remove any cymbal or ride cymbal hits. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided.

Looking at the original groove, I see that the Crash Cymbal (C) and Ride Cymbal (R) are both active. The user wants to remove any cymbal or ride hits, so I need to eliminate those parts.

First, I'll focus on the Crash Cymbal line. In the original, it's "O---|----|----|----", which means it's only hitting on the first beat. To remove the cymbal, I'll set all characters to "-", resulting in "----|----|----|----".

Next, the Ride Cymbal (R) is already "----|----|----|----", so it's already silent. I don't need to change anything here.

Now, I'll check if there are any other cymbal hits in other lines. The Hihat (H) is "X---|X---|X---|X---", which is fine since it's not a cymbal. The Snare (S) has "----|O---|----|O---", which is also acceptable.

Finally, the Toms (T) are "----|----|----|----", so they remain unchanged.

Putting it all together, the edited groove removes the crash cymbal and keeps the ride cymbal silent, fulfilling the user's request to remove any cymbal or ride hits.

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This groove now features:
- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern to provide a solid foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Maintains its backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O").
- **Hihat (H):** Maintained its dynamic pattern with hard closed hits ("X").
- **Toms (T):** Kept silent as per the original groove.
- **Crash Cymbal (C) and Ride Cymbal (R):** Both removed by setting all characters to "-".

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focused on the kick, snare, and hihat without any cymbal or ride hits.
