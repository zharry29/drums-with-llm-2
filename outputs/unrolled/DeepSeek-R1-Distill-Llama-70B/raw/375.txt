**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern to provide a solid foundation.
2. **Snare Drum (S):** Maintains its backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with "O".
3. **Hihat (H):** Maintained with hard closed hits on every offbeat.
4. **Toms (T):** Removed to remove any tom.
5. **Crash Cymbal (C):** Maintains its accents on beats 1 and 3 with "O".
6. **Ride Cymbal (R):** Removed to remove any ride cymbal.

This arrangement keeps the core rhythm intact while removing the toms and ride cymbal as requested.
