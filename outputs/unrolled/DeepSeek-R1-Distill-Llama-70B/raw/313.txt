Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both snare and cymbal elements. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

First, looking at the original drum groove provided by the user:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

From this, I can see that the Kick drum (K) has a mix of hard and soft hits, the Snare drum (S) has backbeats on beats 2 and 4, the Hihat (H) has a dynamic pattern with both open and closed hits, the Toms (T) are silent, the Crash cymbal (C) has an accent on the first beat, and the Ride cymbal (R) is silent.

The user's edit request is to "have not only snare but also cymbal." This means I need to enhance the groove by making sure both the snare and cymbals (both crash and ride) are prominently featured.

First, I'll look at the Snare drum. It already has backbeats on beats 2 and 4, which is good. To make it more prominent, I might consider adding more dynamics or variations, but it seems sufficient for now.

Next, the cymbals. The Crash cymbal (C) is already used on the first beat, which is a strong accent. To fulfill the request, I should also incorporate the Ride cymbal (R). The Ride cymbal can add a steady rhythm or accents on offbeats to complement the Crash cymbal.

Looking at the Hihat (H), it has a dynamic pattern with both open and closed hits. This is good and adds texture to the groove. I'll keep this as it is since it supports both the snare and cymbals.

The Kick drum (K) has a mix of hard and soft hits. I'll keep this to maintain the foundation of the groove.

Now, to incorporate the Ride cymbal, I'll add it to the pattern. I'll use soft closed hits on the offbeats to create a subtle rhythm that complements the Crash cymbal accents. This will ensure the cymbals are not only present but also add texture to the groove.

I'll also ensure that the Crash cymbal remains on the first beat to maintain its strong accent, and the Ride cymbal will be added on the offbeats.

So, the final groove will include:

- **Snare Drum (S):** Maintained backbeats on beats 2 and 4.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept on the first beat.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added on the offbeats with soft closed hits.
- **Hihat (H):** Maintained dynamic pattern.
- **Kick Drum (K):** Kept the mix of hard and soft hits.
- **Toms (T):** Remained silent.

This should fulfill the user's request by having both snare and cymbals prominently featured in the groove.

Here's the final drum groove with both snare and cymbals prominently featured:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|X---|x---|X---
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Snare Drum (S):** Maintained its backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O").
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept its accent on the first beat with a hard hit ("O").
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with soft closed hits ("x") on the offbeats and hard closed hits ("X") on key beats, complementing the crash cymbal.
- **Hihat (H):** Maintained its dynamic pattern with both open and closed hits.
- **Kick Drum (K):** Kept its mix of hard and soft hits to provide a solid foundation.
- **Toms (T):** Kept silent to avoid overcrowding the groove.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and cymbals featured prominently.
