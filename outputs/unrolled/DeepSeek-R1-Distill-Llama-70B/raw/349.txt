Okay, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to remove any snare or cymbal hits from the given drum groove. 

First, I'll look at the original groove:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

I need to ensure that both the snare (S) and cymbals (C and R) are completely removed. 

Starting with the **Snare Drum (S):** It's already all "-", so no changes are needed there.

Next, the **Crash Cymbal (C):** It's also all "-", so it's already removed.

Now, the **Ride Cymbal (R):** The user wants no cymbals, so I'll set all characters in the R line to "-".

Finally, I'll double-check the **Hihat (H)** to ensure it's not accidentally playing, but it seems it's already set to "-" except for some "x" hits. Since hihat isn't a cymbal, I'll leave it as is.

So, the final edited groove will have all S, C, and R lines set to "-", and K and H remain unchanged.
</think>

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This groove now features:
- **Kick Drum (K):** Silent as per the original groove.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Silent as per the edit request.
- **Hihat (H):** Maintained with soft closed hits ("x") on beats 2 and 4.
- **Toms (T):** Silent as per the original groove.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Silent as per the edit request.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Silent as per the edit request.

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focused solely on the hihat without any snare or cymbal hits.
