Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both ride and tom elements. Let's start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

The original groove has:
- Kick drum (K) with a pattern that includes both hard and soft hits
- Snare drum (S) with a few hits
- Hihat (H) with a steady 16th-note pattern
- No Tom hits
- Crash cymbal (C) on the first beat of the first bar
- No Ride cymbal (R) hits

The user's request is to modify this groove to include not only ride but also tom. So, I need to add both ride and tom elements without disrupting the existing rhythm too much.

First, I'll look at where to add the ride cymbal. Ride cymbals are often used to add texture and rhythm, so I'll add them on off-beats or in a pattern that complements the hihat. I'll use 'X' for hard closed hits and 'x' for soft closed hits to add variety.

Next, for the tom hits, I'll add them sparingly to emphasize certain beats. Toms can add depth and interest to the rhythm. I'll place them in the third and fourth beats to create a dynamic contrast.

I'll go through each beat and decide where to insert these new elements. For the ride, I'll add it on the second and fourth beats of the first bar, using 'X' and 'x' to vary the dynamics. In the second bar, I'll continue the ride pattern and add a tom hit on the third beat. Similarly, in the third and fourth bars, I'll maintain the ride pattern and add toms where it feels natural.

I also need to ensure that the crash cymbal is still present on the first beat of the first bar, as it's part of the original groove. The snare and kick patterns will remain mostly unchanged to keep the groove consistent.

After making these adjustments, I'll review the entire pattern to ensure it flows well and meets the user's request. The final groove should have a balanced mix of ride cymbal and tom hits, enhancing the overall rhythm without overpowering the existing elements.
