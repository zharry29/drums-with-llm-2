Alright, so I need to edit this drum groove to make sure it includes both ride and cymbal elements. Let me start by understanding the current groove and the request.

First, looking at the given drum groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I see that the Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), and Crash Cymbal (C) are being used, but the Toms (T) and Ride Cymbal (R) are not active. The user wants the groove to have "not only ride but also cymbal." I interpret this as needing to incorporate both the Ride cymbal (R) and Crash cymbal (C) into the groove.

So, the Crash cymbal is already present, but the Ride cymbal isn't being used. My task is to add Ride cymbal hits while keeping the Crash cymbal active.

I'll start by adding some Ride cymbal notes. Maybe on beats 1 and 3 to give it a steady rhythm. I'll use 'O' for hard hits on the Ride to make it prominent.

Next, I'll check the Crash cymbal to ensure it's being used appropriately. It's currently on the first beat of the first measure. I'll leave that as is but maybe add another Crash on the fourth beat to give it more presence.

Now, looking at the Kick drum, it has a good pattern with some soft hits. I'll keep that as it is because it provides a solid foundation.

The Snare drum has a basic backbeat on beats 2 and 4. I'll keep that to maintain the groove.

The Hihat is quite active with a mix of open and closed hits. I'll leave that as it adds movement to the rhythm.

Since the user didn't mention the Toms, I'll assume they don't need to be added unless specified. So, I'll keep the Toms inactive.

Putting it all together, I'll add Ride cymbal hits on beats 1 and 3 in each measure and ensure the Crash cymbal is used on the first and fourth beats.

Let me visualize the updated groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|O---
R: O---|----|O---|----

This way, both the Ride and Crash cymbals are incorporated into the groove, fulfilling the user's request.
