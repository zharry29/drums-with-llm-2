Alright, so I've got this drum groove that I need to modify. The user wants the groove to have not only tom but also hihat. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the current drum groove. Looking at the provided notation:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I see that the Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), and Crash Cymbal (C) are being used, but the Toms (T) and Ride (R) are not. The user specifically wants to add both Tom and Hihat to the groove.

I'll start by analyzing each instrument's current pattern:

- **Kick Drum (K):** It has a mix of hard and soft hits, with a pattern that creates a dynamic rhythm.
- **Snare Drum (S):** It's used sparingly, adding accents on specific beats.
- **Hihat (H):** It's already present with a mix of open and closed hits, providing a steady rhythm.
- **Toms (T):** Currently not used. I'll need to add Tom hits to enhance the rhythm section.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Used on the first beat of the first and third measures, adding a bright, sharp sound.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Not used. Since the user wants to add Hihat, I'll focus on that, but I'll keep an eye on the Ride in case it's needed for balance.

Now, the main task is to incorporate the Toms (T) and ensure the Hihat (H) is well-integrated. I'll look for places where adding Tom hits can enhance the groove without clashing with other instruments.

Looking at the measures:

1. **First Measure (K: O---|---o|O-O-|----):**
   - The Kick starts with a hard hit, then a soft hit, followed by a hard-soft combo, and ends with a rest.
   - The Snare is resting.
   - The Hihat has a soft open hit, followed by a hard open, then alternating.
   - I can add a Tom hit on the third beat to add depth.

2. **Second Measure (K: ----|O---|----|O---):**
   - The Kick is resting, then a hard hit, rest, and another hard hit.
   - The Snare adds a hit on the fifth beat.
   - The Hihat continues its pattern.
   - Adding a Tom hit on the seventh beat could complement the Snare.

3. **Third Measure (K: O-O-|----|----|----):**
   - The Kick starts with a hard-soft combo, then rests.
   - The Snare is resting.
   - The Hihat continues.
   - A Tom hit on the first beat could emphasize the start of the measure.

4. **Fourth Measure (K: ----|----|----|----):**
   - The Kick rests throughout.
   - The Snare adds a hit on the thirteenth beat.
   - The Hihat continues.
   - Adding a Tom hit on the fifteenth beat can lead into the next measure.

I'll also ensure that the Hihat pattern remains consistent and supports the rhythm without overpowering the new Tom hits. The Crash Cymbal is already providing accents, so I'll leave that as is.

After considering all this, I'll adjust the Tom and Hihat lines to include the necessary hits while maintaining the groove's flow.
