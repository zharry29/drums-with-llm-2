Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both snare and tom. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

Looking at the original groove, the snare is already present, but the tom is not. The user wants the groove to have both snare and tom. 

I'll check each instrument's line. The snare (S) has some hits, so I need to ensure the tom (T) is added without clashing with the snare hits. I'll look for beats where the snare isn't playing and add tom hits there to create a balanced sound.

I'll go through each beat and decide where to place the tom hits. I'll make sure the tom hits complement the snare and kick, enhancing the rhythm without overpowering it. 

After making the adjustments, I'll review the notation to ensure it follows the correct format and that the articulations are accurate for each instrument.
