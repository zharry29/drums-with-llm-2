Alright, I need to help the user by editing their drum groove to include both ride and tom elements. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the original drum groove they provided:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

They want the groove to have not only ride but also tom. So, I need to make sure both the ride cymbal (R) and the tom (T) are included in the final groove.

Looking at the original, the ride cymbal is already present with a pattern: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-. That's good. Now, I need to add the tom hits without disrupting the existing rhythm too much.

I notice that the H (hihat) is not being used in the original, so I can incorporate that to add more texture. The hihat can be played on the offbeats to create a smoother rhythm.

For the tom, I'll add hits on specific beats to complement the kick and snare. Maybe on the second and fourth beats of the second bar to add some variety and keep it interesting.

I also need to ensure that the crash cymbal (C) is used sparingly to accentuate certain beats, perhaps on the first beat of the first and third bars.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust each line:

- **K (Kick Drum):** Keep the original pattern as it provides a solid foundation.
- **S (Snare Drum):** Retain the backbeat on beats 2 and 4 with some variations to add flavor.
- **H (Hihat):** Add closed hits on the offbeats to fill in the gaps and create a driving rhythm.
- **T (Toms):** Introduce tom hits on specific beats to add depth and interest without overpowering the other instruments.
- **C (Crash Cymbal):** Use it on beats 1 of the first and third bars to add accents.
- **R (Ride Cymbal):** Maintain the original pattern as it's already contributing well to the groove.

By making these adjustments, the groove will now include both ride and tom elements, creating a more dynamic and layered sound.
