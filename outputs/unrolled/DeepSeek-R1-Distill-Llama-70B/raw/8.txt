Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to add some tom hits to this drum groove. Let's see, the user has provided a specific drum notation format, and I need to make sure I follow it correctly. 

First, I'll look at the existing groove to understand where the toms can fit in without disrupting the current rhythm. The kick drum (K) has a pattern that seems to be on beats 2 and 4, with some variations. The snare drum (S) is mostly on beat 3, which is common in a lot of drum grooves. The hihat (H) is playing a steady 16th-note rhythm, which gives a nice driving feel. The crash cymbal (C) is accenting the first beat of each measure, which is typical for setting up a new section or adding emphasis.

Now, the toms (T) are currently not being used at all, so I have a blank slate to add some hits there. Since the user just wants "some tom" added, I don't want to overdo it and make the groove too busy. I'll aim for a subtle addition that complements the existing instruments.

I'll start by looking for spots where adding a tom hit would enhance the rhythm without clashing with other instruments. Maybe on the "and" of beat 2 in the first measure and the "and" of beat 4 in the second measure. That way, it adds a little flavor without overpowering the main groove.

I'll choose soft hits (o) for the toms to keep it subtle. So, in the first measure, I'll add an 'o' on the third 16th note of the second beat, and in the second measure, I'll add an 'o' on the third 16th note of the fourth beat. This should give a nice, understated tom presence that adds depth to the groove.

Let me double-check the notation to make sure I'm placing the 'o's correctly. Each beat is separated by a '|', and each character represents a 16th note. So, for the first measure, the second beat would be 'O---', and adding an 'o' on the third 16th note would make it 'O--o'. Similarly, in the second measure, the fourth beat would be 'OO--', and adding an 'o' on the third 16th note would make it 'OO-o'.

I think this addition maintains the balance of the groove and adds just the right amount of tom flavor as requested. I'll go ahead and update the drum groove accordingly.
