Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both hihat and ride cymbal. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

The original groove has the kick drum, snare drum, toms, crash cymbal, and ride cymbal, but the hihat is missing. The user wants the groove to feature both hihat and ride cymbal.

First, I'll look at each instrument's part in the original groove:

- **Kick Drum (K):** It's playing on beats 1, 3, and 4 with soft hits ("o") on beat 2.
- **Snare Drum (S):** It's playing on beats 2 and 4 with a mix of hard hits ("O") and soft open hits ("o").
- **Hihat (H):** It's not playing at all in the original groove.
- **Toms (T):** Not playing.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Not playing.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Playing a dynamic pattern with soft and hard hits on the bow.

To fulfill the user's request, I need to add hihat to the groove while keeping the ride cymbal. I'll decide where to place the hihat hits to complement the existing ride cymbal pattern without making it too busy.

I'll start by adding soft closed hihat hits ("x") on the offbeats to create a steady rhythm. This will support the ride cymbal and add texture without overpowering it. I'll keep the ride cymbal's dynamic pattern to maintain interest.

I'll also ensure that the kick and snare drums remain unchanged to preserve the foundational rhythm. The crash and toms can stay silent to keep the focus on the hihat and ride.

Finally, I'll review the changes to make sure the groove is balanced and dynamic, with both hihat and ride cymbal featured prominently.

Here's the revised drum groove with both hihat and ride cymbal prominently featured:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Hihat (H):** Added soft closed hits ("x") on every offbeat to create a steady rhythm.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Maintained with a dynamic pattern alternating between soft ("o") and hard ("O") hits on the bell.
- **Kick Drum (K) and Snare Drum (S):** Kept unchanged to preserve the foundational rhythm.
- **Toms (T) and Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept silent to focus on the hihat and ride cymbal.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both hihat and ride cymbal featured prominently.
