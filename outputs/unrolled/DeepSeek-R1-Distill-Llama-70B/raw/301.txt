Okay, so I need to edit the given drum groove to include both ride cymbal and snare drum. Let me first understand the current groove and then figure out how to incorporate the ride cymbal without losing the snare's presence.

Looking at the original groove, the kick drum is on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits ("O"), and there's a soft hit ("o") on beat 2. The snare drum has a mix of hard hits ("O"), soft open hits ("o"), and sidestick hits ("x"), which gives it a dynamic feel. The hihat is playing a steady rhythm with soft closed hits ("x") on every eighth note. The toms and crash cymbal are silent in this groove.

The user wants the groove to have not only ride but also snare. Since the snare is already present, I need to make sure the ride cymbal is added in a way that complements the snare without overpowering it.

I'll start by adding the ride cymbal. The ride cymbal can be played with soft closed hits ("x") on the offbeats to add texture without being too loud. I'll place these on beats 2 and 4, where the snare is already playing, to create a layered sound. On beats 1 and 3, I'll use hard closed hits ("X") to emphasize the rhythm, matching the kick drum's hard hits.

Next, I'll ensure the snare drum remains prominent. It already has a good mix of dynamics, so I'll keep it as is. The kick drum's pattern is solid, so I'll leave it unchanged. The hihat's steady rhythm supports both the snare and ride cymbal, so I'll keep that as well.

Finally, I'll make sure the toms and crash cymbal remain silent to keep the focus on the snare and ride cymbal.

Putting it all together, the revised groove should have a balanced mix of snare and ride cymbal, with the kick and hihat providing the foundation.

Here's the revised drum groove with both ride cymbal and snare drum prominently featured:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X---|x---|X---
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with soft closed hits ("x") on the offbeats and hard closed hits ("X") on beats 1 and 3, complementing the snare and adding texture.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Maintained its dynamic pattern with a mix of hard hits ("O"), soft open hits ("o"), and sidestick hits ("x").
- **Kick Drum (K):** Kept unchanged to provide a solid foundation.
- **Hihat (H):** Maintained with soft closed hits ("x") on every eighth note, supporting the rhythm.
- **Toms (T) and Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept silent to focus on the snare and ride cymbal.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both ride cymbal and snare drum featured prominently.
