Okay, so I need to help the user add some tom hits to their existing drum groove. Let me look at the original groove they provided.

First, I see that the Kick (K), Snare (S), and Hihat (H) are already filled out, but the Tom (T) line is all dashes, meaning no toms are being played. The user wants to add some toms to make the groove more interesting.

I should think about where to place the toms. Toms are often used to add flavor and rhythm, especially on off-beat or syncopated parts. Looking at the Snare line, I notice that the snare is played on beats 2 and 4, but there are some softer hits and variations in between. Maybe adding toms on the 'and' of beat 2 and the 'and' of beat 4 would complement the snare without clashing.

So, in the first beat of the second measure (after the first |), I can add a soft tom hit on the 3rd 16th note. That would be the third character in the second beat section. Similarly, in the fourth measure, on the same position, I can add another soft hit. This way, the toms are adding a subtle rhythm without overpowering the main groove.

I should make sure that the toms are soft hits, using a lowercase 'o' since that's the notation for soft hits on toms. I don't want them to be too prominent, just enough to add some movement. Let me check the placement again to ensure they fit well with the existing rhythm.

Yes, placing the 'o's in those positions should create a nice interplay with the snare and hihats without making the groove too busy. I think that's a good addition. Now, I'll update the Tom line accordingly.

Let me think about how to add some tom hits to this groove. Toms are often used to add flavor and rhythm, and in this case, I'll add some soft tom hits to complement the snare and hihat rhythm.

I'll add a soft tom hit on the "and" of beat 2 in the first measure, and another on the "and" of beat 4 in the second measure. This will create a subtle rhythmic interest without overpowering the main groove.

Here's the updated groove:
