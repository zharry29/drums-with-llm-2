Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove. They provided a drum notation system and a specific groove they want to modify. The edit request is to have "not only kick but also ride." Let me break this down.

First, I'll look at the original groove they provided. It looks like this:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

From this, I can see that the kick drum (K) isn't being used at all, and the ride cymbal (R) is being used in a specific pattern. The edit request is to add kick drum hits and adjust the ride cymbal if necessary.

I need to add kick drum hits to the groove. I'll look at where it makes sense to add them. Typically, the kick drum is used on beats 1 and 3 in a 4/4 time signature, but I can adjust based on the feel.

Looking at the Hihat (H) line, it's playing on the second 16th note of each beat. That suggests a steady rhythm. I'll add kick hits on beats 1 and 3 to complement the hihat and create a basic rock or pop groove.

So, I'll modify the K line to have 'O' on the first and third beats. I'll leave the R line as is since it's already providing a ride cymbal pattern, but I might adjust it slightly to fit with the kick hits.

Here's how I'll modify the groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This way, the kick drum is added on beats 1 and 3, and the ride cymbal continues to play its pattern, creating a balanced groove that meets the user's request.
