Alright, I'm trying to help the user edit their drum groove to include both cymbals and hihats. Let me see what they have and what they need.

First, I look at the original drum groove they provided:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

I notice that the Hihat (H) is already being used with a pattern of "X-x-" in each beat. So, there are hihats present. But the user wants to make sure that there are not only cymbals but also hihats. Maybe they feel the hihats are not prominent enough or want more cymbal elements.

Looking at the instruments:

- **K**: Kick drum has a pattern with hits on beats 1 and 2 in the first measure, beat 3 in the second, and nothing in the fourth.
- **S**: Snare drum has a mix of hard hits (O), soft open hits (o), and sidesticks (x).
- **H**: Hihat is being played with a mix of hard closed hits (X) and soft closed hits (x).
- **T**: Toms are not used here.
- **C**: Crash cymbal is not used at all.
- **R**: Ride cymbal is also not used.

The user wants to ensure that besides the cymbals (C and R), the hihats (H) are also present. Currently, there are no crash or ride cymbals in the groove. So, to fulfill the request, I need to add cymbal elements while keeping the hihats.

I think adding crash cymbals on key beats could enhance the groove. Maybe on beat 1 of each measure to give a strong accent. Also, incorporating ride cymbal hits on the offbeats could add more texture and rhythm.

I should also ensure that the hihats are still audible and complement the new cymbal additions. Perhaps adjusting the hihat pattern to be more consistent or adding some open hits could make them stand out more.

Let me sketch out a possible edit:

1. **Crash Cymbal (C)**: Add "O" on the first beat of each measure to create strong accents.
2. **Ride Cymbal (R)**: Add "O" on the offbeats (like beats 2 and 4) to add rhythmic interest.
3. **Hihat (H)**: Maybe simplify the pattern to "x-x-" to keep it steady and let the cymbals shine through.
4. **Kick (K)** and **Snare (S)**: Keep their patterns to maintain the foundational rhythm.

Putting it all together, the edited groove would look something like this:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--
```

This way, the groove now includes crash and ride cymbals while maintaining the hihats, creating a balanced and dynamic rhythm section.

To address the request of incorporating both cymbals and hihats into the drum groove, I have revised the original pattern to include these elements effectively. Here's the final version:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--
```

This revised groove features:
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Added on the first beat of each measure to create strong accents.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Played on the offbeats to add rhythmic interest and texture.
- **Hihat (H):** Maintains a steady rhythm with soft closed hits, complementing the cymbals.
- **Kick (K) and Snare (S):** Retain their original patterns to preserve the groove's foundational rhythm.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with the inclusion of both cymbals and hihats.
