Alright, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both snare and hihat. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

First, looking at the original drum groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The user wants the groove to have not only snare but also hihat. From the original, I can see that the snare (S) is already present with some hits, and the hihat (H) has a steady 16th-note pattern with "X-x-" in each beat. So, it seems the hihat is already included. Maybe the user wants to enhance or modify the hihat pattern to make it more prominent or adjust it to better complement the snare.

I should ensure that both the snare and hihat are clearly present and balanced in the groove. Perhaps adding more hihat articulations or adjusting the snare hits to create a better rhythm section.

I'll keep the existing hihat pattern as it's already providing a solid foundation. For the snare, I might add a few more hits to make it more dynamic, ensuring it doesn't clash with the kick drum (K). I'll also check the other instruments to make sure they're supporting the rhythm without overpowering the snare and hihat.

After making these adjustments, I'll present the updated groove with both snare and hihat clearly featured.
