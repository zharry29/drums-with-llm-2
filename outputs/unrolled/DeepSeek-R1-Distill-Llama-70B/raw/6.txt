Alright, so I need to add some tom hits to this drum groove. Let me first look at the existing groove to understand where the toms can fit in without clashing with the other instruments.

Looking at the Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), and other lines, it seems like the groove is pretty straightforward with the kick on beats 1 and 3, the snare on beats 2 and 4, and the hihat playing steady 16th notes. The toms are currently not being used, so adding them can add some flavor and rhythm.

I want to add the toms in a way that complements the existing rhythm. Maybe I can add a soft tom hit on the "and" of beat 2 in the first measure and another on the "and" of beat 4 in the second measure. This will create a subtle rhythmic interest without overpowering the main groove.

So, I'll add an 'o' (soft hit) on the 9th and 13th 16th notes in the T line. That should do it.
