Okay, so I need to help edit a drum groove to include both kick and tom. Let me start by understanding the original groove.

Looking at the original, the kick (K) is on beats 1 and 3, which is a common pattern. The snare (S) is on beats 2 and 4, which is also typical for a backbeat. The hihat (H) is playing steady 16th notes, which keeps the rhythm going. The toms (T) and crash cymbal (C) aren't used here, and the ride cymbal (R) is also not present.

The edit request is to have not only kick but also tom. So, I need to add the toms into the groove. Toms are often used to add flavor and rhythm, especially in fills or to accentuate certain beats.

I'll start by identifying where to place the tom hits. Since the kick is on beats 1 and 3, adding toms on the off-beats or on specific rhythms can add interest. Maybe I can add a tom hit on the "and" of beat 2 and on beat 4 to complement the snare. Using 'O' for a hard hit on the toms will make them stand out.

I'll update the T line to include these hits. I'll make sure not to clash with the kick and snare, so placing them in between makes sense. I'll also keep the hihat steady to maintain the rhythm.

So, the final groove will have the kick on beats 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4, hihat steady, and toms adding some rhythm in between.
