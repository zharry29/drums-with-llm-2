Alright, I need to help the user by editing their drum groove to include both ride cymbal and snare drum. Let's start by understanding the current groove and the edit request.

The user provided a drum groove where only the ride cymbal is active. The edit request is to have both ride and snare. So, my goal is to add snare drum hits while keeping the ride cymbal.

First, I'll look at the original groove:

- **Kick Drum (K):** All are "-", meaning no hits.
- **Snare Drum (S):** All are "-", so no hits.
- **Hihat (H):** Has "x" on beats 2 and 4, soft closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** All are "-", no hits.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** All are "-", no hits.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Alternates between "x" and "X" in a pattern, providing a dynamic rhythm.

To fulfill the edit request, I need to add snare drum hits. Typically, snare drums are used on beats 2 and 4 in a 4/4 time signature, providing a backbeat. I'll add "O" on beats 2 and 4 for the snare drum to make it prominent.

I'll keep the ride cymbal pattern as it is because it already adds a good dynamic element. The hihat can remain with soft hits to support the rhythm without overpowering the snare and ride.

So, the revised groove will have:

- **Snare Drum (S):** "O" on beats 2 and 4.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Keep the existing pattern.
- **Hihat (H):** Keep the existing pattern.
- **Kick Drum (K):** Remain silent to keep the focus on snare and ride.
- **Toms (T) and Crash Cymbal (C):** Remain silent for simplicity.

I'll ensure that the snare hits are prominent and the ride cymbal complements them without clashing. This should create a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both ride and snare featured.

Here's the revised drum groove with both ride cymbal and snare drum prominently featured:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Snare Drum (S):** Added hard hits ("O") on beats 2 and 4, providing a strong backbeat.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Maintained with a dynamic pattern alternating between soft ("x") and hard ("X") hits, adding texture and interest.
- **Hihat (H):** Kept with soft closed hits ("x") on beats 2 and 4 to support the rhythm.
- **Kick Drum (K), Toms (T), and Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept silent to focus on the snare and ride cymbal.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and ride cymbal featured prominently.
