Okay, so I need to add some tom hits to this drum groove. Let me look at the given groove first.

The groove is pretty minimal right now. The kick and snare are not playing anything, which is unusual for a typical drum groove. The hihat is only playing on the second and fourth beats, which is a common pattern, but it's pretty simple. The ride cymbal has a more intricate pattern with some hard and soft hits on the bell and bow. The toms are completely silent, so that's where I can add some flavor.

I want to add the toms in a way that complements the existing rhythm without making it too busy. Since the groove is minimal, I should probably keep the tom hits sparse and rhythmic. Maybe adding a tom hit on the "and" of beat 1 and beat 3 could add some interest without clashing with the ride cymbal pattern.

Let me visualize the current groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

I'll add soft tom hits ('o') on the 8th and 12th 16th notes. That would look like this:

T: ----|---o|----|---o

This way, the toms are adding a subtle rhythmic layer that enhances the groove without overpowering it. The soft hits will blend nicely with the hihat and ride cymbal.

So, the final groove with the added toms would be:
