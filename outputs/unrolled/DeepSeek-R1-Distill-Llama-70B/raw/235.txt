Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both snare and tom. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

The original groove has:
- **K:** No kick drum hits
- **S:** No snare drum hits
- **H:** Hihat on the 2nd and 4th beats
- **T:** No tom hits
- **C:** No crash cymbal
- **R:** Ride cymbal on beats 1, 3, and alternating with closed hits

The edit request is to add snare and tom. I need to ensure both are included without clashing with the existing rhythm.

First, I'll add snare hits. Typically, snares are on beats 2 and 4, so I'll place 'S' on those beats. Next, for the tom, I'll add hits on the "and" of beat 3 to add some syncopation, using 'o' for a soft hit to keep it subtle.

I'll make sure the hihat and ride cymbal patterns remain consistent, keeping the groove steady. I'll also ensure the crash cymbal isn't needed here since the focus is on snare and tom.

Finally, I'll review the notation to ensure it fits the 16-note structure and that each instrument's articulation is correct.
