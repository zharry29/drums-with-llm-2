Alright, I need to edit the given drum groove so that it includes both tom and hihat. Let me start by understanding the current groove and then make the necessary adjustments.

First, looking at the provided drum groove:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

I notice that the hihat (H) is already being used extensively with a pattern of "X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-". That's good because the edit request is to include hihat. Now, I need to ensure that the tom (T) is also included.

Currently, the tom line is all empty:

```
T: ----|----|----|----
```

To fulfill the request, I should add some tom hits. I'll choose appropriate spots that complement the existing rhythm without clashing with other instruments. Let's add a hard hit (O) on the third beat of the third measure and a soft hit (o) on the fourth beat of the fourth measure. This will add some texture without overwhelming the groove.

So, the updated tom line becomes:

```
T: ----|----|---O|---o
```

I'll leave the rest of the groove unchanged to maintain the original feel. Now, putting it all together, the revised groove with both tom and hihat is:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|---O|---o
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This should satisfy the edit request by incorporating both the tom and hihat effectively.
