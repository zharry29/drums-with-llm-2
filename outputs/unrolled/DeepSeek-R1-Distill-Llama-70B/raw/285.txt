Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both snare and ride cymbal. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided. 

Looking at their current setup:
- **Kick Drum (K):** It's completely silent. All characters are "-", which means it's not playing at all.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Also silent. No hits or sidesticks.
- **Hihat (H):** There's a soft closed hit ("x") on the second beat of the second and fourth measures. So, it's playing on beats 2 and 4, but very softly.
- **Toms (T):** Not playing at all.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Silent as well.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** This is where most of the action is. It has a mix of soft closed hits ("x") and hard closed hits ("X") in a pattern that alternates between soft and hard on different beats.

The user wants the groove to have not only snare but also ride. So, I need to introduce the snare drum into this setup while keeping the ride cymbal active.

First, I'll think about where to place the snare drum. Typically, the snare drum plays on the backbeats, which are beats 2 and 4 in a 4/4 time signature. So, I'll add snare hits on those beats. 

Next, I'll consider the type of hit. The user's original groove uses "X" and "x" for the ride cymbal, which are hard and soft closed hits. For the snare, I can use "O" for a hard hit or "o" for a soft open hit. Since the user didn't specify, I'll go with "O" for a more pronounced snare sound.

Now, I'll add "O" on beats 2 and 4 for the snare drum. 

I also notice that the hihat is playing softly on beats 2 and 4. To make the snare more prominent, I might want to adjust the hihat to play on different parts of the beat or make it softer. But since the user only asked to add snare and keep the ride, I'll leave the hihat as is for now.

Finally, I'll ensure that the ride cymbal remains active with its original pattern, which already adds a nice dynamic with the alternating soft and hard hits.

Putting it all together, the revised groove will have:
- **Snare Drum (S):** Hard hits on beats 2 and 4.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Maintains its original pattern with alternating soft and hard closed hits.
- **Hihat (H):** Soft closed hits on beats 2 and 4.
- **Kick Drum (K), Toms (T), and Crash Cymbal (C):** Remain silent as per the original setup.

This should fulfill the user's request to have both snare and ride cymbal in the groove.

Here's the revised drum groove with both snare and ride cymbal prominently featured:

```
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Snare Drum (S):** Added hard hits ("O") on beats 2 and 4, making it prominent and driving.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Maintains its dynamic pattern with alternating soft ("x") and hard ("X") closed hits, adding texture and interest.
- **Hihat (H):** Soft closed hits ("x") on beats 2 and 4, supporting the rhythm without overpowering the snare and ride.
- **Kick Drum (K), Toms (T), and Crash Cymbal (C):** Remain silent to keep the focus on the snare and ride cymbal.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and ride cymbal featured prominently.
