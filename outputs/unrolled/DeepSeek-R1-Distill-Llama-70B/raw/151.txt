Okay, so I need to help edit this drum groove to include both hihat and snare. Let me first understand what's going on in the current groove.

Looking at the given drum groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

I see that the Kick drum (K) has a soft hit every other beat, which is 'o' and '--o-' alternating. The Snare drum (S) has some sidestick hits on beats 2 and 4, with 'X' and '--X-'. The Hihat (H) is playing on the second half of beats 2 and 4 with 'x---' and '----|x---'. The Ride cymbal (R) is playing a pattern with 'x' and 'X' on beats 1 and 3.

The user wants the groove to have not only hihat but also snare. So, I need to make sure that the Snare drum is more prominent, maybe adding more snare hits where appropriate, while keeping the hihat pattern intact.

First, I'll look at the Snare drum line. Currently, it has 'X' on beats 2 and 4, which are sidesticks. Maybe I can change some of those to regular snare hits ('O' or 'o') to make the snare more audible. For example, changing the 'X' to 'O' on beat 2 and keeping the '--X-' on beat 4, or vice versa.

Next, the Hihat is currently playing on the second half of beats 2 and 4. To make it more prominent, I could change some of the 'x' to 'O' for harder hits, or maybe add more 'x' hits to create a more driving rhythm. Perhaps adding 'x' on the offbeats or varying the pattern to include both open and closed hits.

I also notice that the Kick drum is playing softly with 'o'. Maybe to make the groove more dynamic, I could alternate between soft ('o') and hard ('O') kicks, or adjust the pattern to complement the snare and hihat.

The Tom-toms (T) and Crash cymbal (C) are not playing in this groove. Since the focus is on adding snare and hihat, I might leave them as is unless I want to add some accents for flavor.

The Ride cymbal (R) has a nice pattern with 'x' and 'X'. I'll keep that as it is unless it's conflicting with the hihat.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust the Snare drum to include more regular hits and maybe vary the Hihat pattern to make it more interesting. I'll also ensure that the Kick drum complements the snare without overpowering it.

So, my plan is:

1. Modify the Snare drum to include both 'O' and 'X' hits for variety.
2. Adjust the Hihat pattern to include both 'x' and 'O' for dynamics.
3. Keep the Kick drum pattern but maybe alternate between 'o' and 'O' for variation.
4. Leave the Tom-toms and Crash cymbal as is.
5. Keep the Ride cymbal pattern unchanged.

Let me visualize the changes:

- Snare (S): Change 'X' to 'O' on beat 2 and keep '--X-' on beat 4, or maybe add an 'O' on beat 4 as well.
- Hihat (H): Maybe change some 'x' to 'O' on beats 1 and 3 for harder hits.
- Kick (K): Alternate between 'o' and 'O' for a dynamic feel.
- Ride (R): Keep the existing pattern.

I think that should make the groove have both hihat and snare more prominently featured.
