Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both snare and tom. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided.

Looking at the original groove:
- The kick drum (K) has a solid pattern with hits on beats 1 and 3, and some syncopation.
- The snare drum (S) is already present with a mix of open hits (O) and sidestick hits (X, x), which adds some texture.
- The hihat (H) has a steady 16th-note pattern, which is common in many grooves.
- The toms (T) are not used, and the cymbals (C, R) are mostly absent except for the ride.

The edit request is to have not only snare but also tom. So, I need to ensure that the tom is incorporated into the groove. 

First, I'll look at where the snare is placed and see if adding the tom in complementary spots makes sense. The snare is on beats 2 and 4, and the kick is on beats 1 and 3. Adding the tom on off-beat or syncopated parts could add interest without clashing with the kick and snare.

I'll consider adding the tom on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4, using soft hits (o) to keep it subtle. This way, the tom adds movement without overpowering the main rhythm.

I'll also check the hihat pattern to ensure it supports the rhythm without conflicting with the added tom hits. The current hihat pattern is steady, so it should work well with the additions.

Finally, I'll make sure the cymbals are used sparingly to accentuate the groove without making it too busy.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust the T line to include the tom hits and ensure the overall groove remains balanced and musical.
