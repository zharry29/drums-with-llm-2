Okay, so I need to create a drum groove that includes both snare and kick drums. Let me start by understanding the given drum notation. Each line represents a different drum or cymbal, and the characters denote when and how they're played.

Looking at the original groove, the kick drum (K) is already present, but it's a bit busy with "O---|---o|O-O-|----". I want to make it more prominent, so maybe I'll simplify it to "O---|---O|O---|---O" to have clear hard hits on beats 1 and 3 and soft hits on beat 2.

The snare drum (S) is currently "----|O---|----|O---", which is good, but I want to make it more dynamic. I'll change it to "----|O---|----|O---" to keep the backbeats on beats 2 and 4.

I notice the hihat (H) was "----|----|----|----", so I'll add a steady rhythm with "x---|x---|x---|x---" using soft closed hits to support the kick and snare.

The toms (T) and crash cymbal (C) are already there, but I'll keep them simple. The ride cymbal (R) wasn't in the original, so I'll add it with "-x--|-x--|-x--|-x--" to complement the hihat.

Finally, I'll make sure the groove is balanced and dynamic, with both snare and kick featured prominently.

```
K: O---|---O|O---|---O
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: -x--|-x--|-x--|-x--
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Kick Drum (K):** Simplified to "O---|---O|O---|---O" to provide clear hard hits on beats 1 and 3 and soft hits on beat 2.
2. **Snare Drum (S):** Maintained its backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O").
3. **Hihat (H):** Added a steady eighth-note rhythm with soft closed hits ("x").
4. **Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept its accents on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits ("O").
5. **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added a steady pattern on the offbeats with soft closed hits ("x").

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and kick drum featured prominently.
