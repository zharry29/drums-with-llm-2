Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both ride cymbal and snare drum. Let's see what they provided. 

First, they have a drum notation system where each line represents a different drum or cymbal. The given groove has Kick (K), Snare (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash Cymbal (C), and Ride Cymbal (R). 

Looking at the original groove, the Kick drum is pretty busy with "O--O| --O-|OOO-|-OOO". The Snare drum is playing on beats 2 and 4 with "O---| ----|O---". The Hihat is silent, which is unusual. The Toms and Crash Cymbal are also silent. The Ride cymbal is completely silent too. 

The user wants the groove to have not only ride but also snare. So, I need to make sure both the snare and ride cymbal are prominently featured.

First, I'll look at the snare drum. It's already playing on beats 2 and 4, which is good. Maybe I can add some flavor with sidesticks or different articulations, but it's already providing a good backbeat.

Next, the ride cymbal is currently not used at all. To include it, I should add some hits. Ride cymbals usually play steady rhythms, often on offbeats, to give a driving feel. I'll add some closed hits ("x") on the offbeats and maybe some accented hits ("X") on key beats to make it stand out.

I also notice the Hihat is silent. Since the user wants the groove to have both ride and snare, maybe keeping the Hihat silent is okay, but if I want to add more texture, I could include some soft hits. However, the user specifically asked for ride and snare, so I'll focus on those.

The Kick drum is quite busy. Maybe simplifying it to play on beats 1 and 3 would make the groove cleaner and let the snare and ride take the spotlight. So, I'll adjust the Kick drum to "O---| ----|O---| ----".

The Crash Cymbal is playing on every beat, which might be too much. I'll simplify it to play only on the first beat of each measure to add accents without overwhelming the other elements.

Putting it all together, the Kick drum will play on beats 1 and 3, the Snare drum will keep its backbeats on 2 and 4, the Ride cymbal will play a steady rhythm with some accents, and the Crash Cymbal will provide accents at the beginning of each measure.

I'll make sure the Hihat remains silent to keep the focus on the requested elements. 

So, the final groove should have:
- Kick drum on beats 1 and 3
- Snare drum on beats 2 and 4
- Ride cymbal with a steady pattern
- Crash Cymbal accents on beat 1
- Hihat and Toms silent

This should fulfill the user's request to have both ride and snare prominently featured in the groove.

Here's the revised drum groove with both ride cymbal and snare drum prominently featured:

```
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: x---|X---|x---|X---
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Kick Drum (K):** Simplified to play on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits ("O"), providing a solid foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Maintains its backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O").
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with soft closed hits ("x") on the offbeats and hard hits ("X") on key beats, adding texture and interest.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Simplified to play on the first beat of each measure with hard hits ("O"), providing strong accents.
- **Hihat (H) and Toms (T):** Kept silent to focus on the snare and ride cymbal.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and ride cymbal featured prominently.
