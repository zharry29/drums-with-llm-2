Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a drum groove and wants to edit it so that it includes both hihat and snare. The original groove seems to have the hihat (H) and kick drum (K) already, but the snare (S) isn't present or is minimal. The goal is to modify the groove to include snare hits while keeping the hihat active.

First, I'll look at the given drum groove:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

From this, I can see that the kick drum (K) has hits on beats 1, 3, and 4, with a soft hit on the second beat. The snare drum (S) has hits on beats 2 and 4, but they're not consistent across all beats. The hihat (H) is active throughout, with a mix of open and closed hits. The toms (T), crash cymbal (C), and ride cymbal (R) are either not played or minimally played.

The edit request is to ensure that the groove has not only hihat but also snare. So, my main focus should be on enhancing the snare drum's presence while maintaining the hihat's activity.

Looking at the hihat line (H), it's already quite busy with a pattern that alternates between open and closed hits. This is good because it provides a driving rhythm. However, the snare drum (S) only has hits on beats 2 and 4 in the first and third bars, which might make the groove feel a bit sparse in terms of snare presence.

To make the groove more dynamic and to include more snare hits, I should consider adding snare hits on beats that complement the kick drum and hihat. Typically, in many drum grooves, the snare is played on beats 2 and 4, but sometimes additional hits on off-beats can add flavor.

I'll start by analyzing each beat and see where adding a snare hit would enhance the groove without clashing with the existing kick drum hits. For example, in the first beat, the kick is on the first note, so adding a snare on the second or fourth note of that beat could work well.

Looking at the current snare line:

```
S: ----|O---|----|O---
```

This translates to snare hits on the second beat of the first bar and the second beat of the third bar. To make it more consistent and add more snare presence, I could add snare hits on every second and fourth beat across all bars. This would create a more driving rhythm and make the groove feel more complete.

So, modifying the snare line to:

```
S: ----|O---|----|O---|----|O---|----|O---
```

This way, the snare is consistently played on beats 2 and 4 throughout the groove, which is a common pattern in many drum grooves and should complement the hihat and kick drum nicely.

Now, I'll integrate this into the full drum groove, ensuring that the hihat remains active and that the snare is added appropriately without conflicting with the kick drum hits.

Finalizing the edited groove:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This should meet the user's request by incorporating both hihat and snare drum hits effectively.
