Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both ride and tom. Let me look at the original groove they provided.

The user wants to add both ride and tom. Currently, the T (Toms) and R (Ride) lines are empty or not used much. I need to add hits to these.

First, I'll look at the structure. The groove has four beats, each with four 16th notes. I'll need to add tom hits and ride hits without making it too busy.

For the Tom (T), I'll add some hits to give it more rhythm. Maybe on the off-beats or specific notes to add flavor. Let's say I add a hard hit on the third note of the first beat and a soft hit on the fourth note of the third beat.

For the Ride (R), I'll add some closed hits (x) on the second and fourth beats to give it a subtle rhythm. Maybe on the second note of the second beat and the fourth note of the fourth beat.

I'll make sure not to clash with the existing hits from other instruments. Let me adjust the T and R lines accordingly.

I think this adds the necessary ride and tom elements without overpowering the existing rhythm.
