Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. The user wants to add both crash cymbal and ride cymbal elements to the existing groove. 

First, I'll look at the current groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

I notice that the crash cymbal (C) and ride cymbal (R) are not being used. The user wants both to be included.

For the crash cymbal, I'll add hits on the first beat of each measure to give it a solid, driving feel. So, I'll place an 'O' on the first beat of each bar in the C line.

Next, for the ride cymbal, I'll create a steady rhythm to complement the hihat. I'll alternate between open (X) and closed (x) hits to add texture. Starting with a closed hit on the first beat, then open on the second, and so on, should work well.

Putting it all together, the updated groove should have the crash cymbal on beats 1 and 3, and the ride cymbal with a mix of open and closed hits throughout.

I'll make sure to update the C and R lines accordingly while keeping the rest of the groove intact. This should fulfill the user's request by incorporating both cymbal elements effectively.
