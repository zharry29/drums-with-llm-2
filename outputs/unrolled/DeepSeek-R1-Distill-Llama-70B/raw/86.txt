Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both cymbal and tom. Let me start by understanding the current groove they provided.

Looking at the groove, the kick (K) has a soft hit on the second and fourth beats, the snare (S) has some sidestick hits, the hihat (H) is playing on the off-beats, and the ride (R) is playing a steady rhythm with some variations. The crash cymbal (C) and toms (T) aren't being used much.

The user wants to add more cymbal and tom hits. I think adding crash cymbals on the first beat of each bar could give it a stronger start. For the toms, maybe adding some hits on the third beat to add depth and rhythm. I'll make sure not to overdo it so the groove stays balanced.

I'll go through each instrument line and insert the necessary hits. For the crash cymbal, I'll place an "O" on the first beat of each bar. For the toms, I'll add an "O" on the third beat. I'll also adjust the hihat to make it more dynamic by adding some closed hits with "X" and "x".

Let me put it all together and make sure everything aligns correctly with the beats. I'll double-check each line to ensure the changes fit the 16-note structure and that the articulations make sense for each instrument.
