Alright, so I need to help the user edit a drum groove based on their request. The user provided a drum notation system and a specific groove that needs to be modified. The edit request is to ensure that the groove includes both ride cymbal and tom hits, in addition to what's already there.

First, I'll look at the original groove provided by the user:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

From this, I can see that the kick (K) and snare (S) are already being used, along with the hihat (H). The tom (T), crash cymbal (C), and ride cymbal (R) are not being used.

The user's edit request is to have the groove include not only ride but also tom. So, I need to add both ride cymbal hits and tom hits to the existing groove.

I'll start by adding the ride cymbal. Looking at the ride cymbal line (R), it's currently all dashes, meaning it's not being played. I'll add some ride hits. Since the groove seems to have a steady rhythm, I'll add ride hits on the off-beats to give it a driving feel. I'll use "X" for hard closed hits on the ride cymbal.

Next, I'll add the tom hits. The tom line (T) is also all dashes. I'll add a hard hit "O" on the third beat of the second bar and a soft hit "o" on the fourth beat of the fourth bar to add some texture and rhythm without overpowering the main groove.

I'll make sure that the additions don't clash with the existing kick and snare hits and that the overall rhythm remains coherent. I'll also ensure that the crash cymbal (C) remains unused as per the original groove unless specified otherwise.

Finally, I'll review the modified groove to ensure that it meets the user's requirements and that the notation is correct.
