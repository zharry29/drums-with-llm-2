Alright, so I need to help edit a drum groove to include both cymbal and snare. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

First, looking at the original drum groove:

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

From this, I can see that the kick drum (K) has hits on beats 1 and 2 in the first measure, beat 3 in the second measure, and so on. The snare drum (S) is already present with some hits, which is good because the edit request wants more snare. The hihat (H) has a steady rhythm with "X-x-" pattern, which is common for a driving rhythm. The toms (T) are not used here, and the crash (C) and ride (R) cymbals are also not present.

The edit request is to have "not only cymbal but also snare." So, I need to ensure that both the cymbals (crash and ride) and the snare are included in the groove.

First, I'll look at the snare drum. It's already present, but maybe it can be emphasized more or added in places where it's missing. The current snare pattern is:

```
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
```

This means the snare is played on the second beat of the first measure, the second and fourth beats of the second measure, and the fourth beat of the fourth measure. To make the snare more prominent, I could add more hits or vary the articulation.

Next, the cymbals. The crash cymbal (C) is typically used to accentuate the start of a measure or to add color on specific beats. The ride cymbal (R) often provides a steady rhythm. In the original groove, neither is used, so I'll need to add them.

For the crash cymbal, I might add hits at the beginning of each measure and perhaps on the "and" of beat 2 in each measure to add some flavor. For the ride cymbal, I'll create a steady pattern, maybe playing on every eighth note or in a "x-x-x-x" pattern.

I also notice that the hihat (H) is already providing a steady rhythm, so maybe I can keep that as is or adjust it slightly to complement the ride cymbal.

Now, putting it all together, I'll modify the groove to include the crash cymbal on beats 1 and 3 of each measure and the ride cymbal with a steady pattern. I'll also ensure the snare is present on beats 2 and 4, perhaps adding some variations to make it more dynamic.

I should also check that the kick drum pattern remains consistent unless the edit request specifies changes there. Since the focus is on adding snare and cymbals, I'll keep the kick drum as is.

Finally, I'll review the modified groove to ensure that the cymbals and snare are well-integrated and that the overall rhythm feels cohesive and balanced.
