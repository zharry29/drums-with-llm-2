Okay, I need to edit the drum groove so that it doesn't include any hihat or tom hits. Let me start by looking at the original groove provided.

The original groove has the following instruments:
- **Kick Drum (K):** O--O|----|--O-|----
- **Snare Drum (S):** ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- **Hihat (H):** ----|----|----|----
- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** ----|----|----|----
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

The user wants to remove both the hihat and tom hits. Since the hihat and tom lines are already empty in the original groove, I don't need to make any changes to them. However, I should ensure that no new hits are added to these lines.

I should also review the other instruments to ensure that the groove remains balanced without the hihat and toms. The kick and snare drums are still present and provide a strong rhythm. The crash and ride cymbals add texture and accents.

So, the final groove will be the same as the original, with the hihat and tom lines remaining empty.

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
```

**Explanation:**

- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern, providing a solid foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S):** Keeps its dynamic pattern with a mix of hard hits ("O") and soft open hits ("o").
- **Hihat (H) and Toms (T):** Both are silenced as per the edit request.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept silent to avoid adding unnecessary accents.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Maintained with a mix of soft ("o") and hard ("O") hits, adding texture to the groove.

This arrangement creates a rhythm focused on the kick and snare drums without any hihat or tom hits.
