Alright, I need to help the user add some tom hits to their drum groove. Let's see what they have so far.

Looking at the drum groove they provided, I see that the kick drum (K) is quite active with a pattern like OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO. The snare drum (S) has hits on beats 2 and 4 in the second and fourth measures. The hihat (H) and toms (T) are currently not being used, and the crash cymbal (C) is being hit on every beat. The ride cymbal (R) isn't being used at all.

The user wants to add some tom hits to this groove. Toms are great for adding flavor and rhythm, so I should figure out where to place them without clashing with the existing instruments. Since the kick and snare are already providing a solid foundation, the toms can add some accents or fills.

I'll start by looking for gaps where adding a tom hit would complement the rhythm. In the first measure, the kick is playing on the first three 16th notes, so maybe adding a soft tom hit (o) on the fourth note would create a nice flow without conflicting with the kick. Similarly, in the second measure, after the snare hit on the second beat, adding a soft tom hit on the fourth note could add some movement.

In the third measure, the kick is again playing three hits, so adding a soft tom on the fourth note would maintain consistency. Finally, in the fourth measure, after the snare hit, another soft tom on the fourth note would wrap up the bar nicely.

I also notice that the crash cymbal is being hit on every beat, which might be a bit overwhelming. Maybe I can adjust that to give the groove some dynamics, but the main focus is on adding toms. However, since the user specifically asked to add toms, I'll focus on that and perhaps adjust the crash cymbal in a subtle way if needed.

So, I'll add soft tom hits (o) in the T line at the end of each measure, specifically on the 16th notes that are not already occupied by other instruments. This should add a subtle rhythmic interest without overpowering the existing elements.

Finally, I'll ensure that the notation is correct, using 'o' for soft hits on the toms and maintaining the structure with '|' separating each beat.
