Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove to include both snare and tom. Let me look at the original groove first.

The original has:
- **K (Kick):** O---|----|O---|---- (so on beats 1 and 3)
- **S (Snare):** ----|O---|----|O--- (on beats 2 and 4)
- **H (Hihat):** x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x- (steady 16th notes)
- **T (Tom):** o---|----|----|---- (only on the first 16th note)
- **C (Crash):** O---|----|----|---- (only on the first beat)
- **R (Ride):** ----|----|----|---- (not played)

The edit request is to have both snare and tom. I notice that the snare is already present on beats 2 and 4, which is good. The tom is only on the first 16th note, so I need to add more tom hits to make it more prominent.

I should think about where to add the tom hits. Maybe adding them on the off-beats or on specific beats to create a rhythm. Let's say I add toms on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4. That would give it a driving feel.

So, I'll adjust the Tom line to include hits on the 9th and 13th 16th notes, which are the "and" of beats 2 and 4. I'll use 'O' for a hard hit to make them stand out.

Let me visualize the new Tom line: ----|---O|----|---O

Now, I'll update the groove accordingly.
