Okay, I need to help the user by editing their drum groove to include both ride cymbal and snare drum. Let me start by understanding the original groove they provided.

Looking at the original groove:

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

I notice that the ride cymbal (R) isn't used at all. The snare drum (S) is only played on the third beat with a sidestick ("S"). The hihat (H) has a steady pattern with soft closed hits ("x"). The kick drum (K) has a varied pattern, and the crash cymbal (C) is played on every beat.

The user wants the groove to include both ride and snare. So, I need to add ride cymbal hits and possibly enhance the snare drum.

First, I'll think about where to place the ride cymbal. Typically, ride cymbals are played on offbeats to add rhythmic interest. I'll add ride hits on the offbeats with soft closed hits ("x") and see how that fits.

Next, the snare drum. Currently, it's only on the third beat. To make it more prominent, I'll add it on the second and fourth beats as well, using hard hits ("O").

I should also consider the overall balance. The crash cymbal is quite prominent on every beat, which might clash with the ride and snare. Maybe I'll reduce its usage to just the first beat of each measure.

Let me sketch out the changes:

- **Snare Drum (S):** Add "O" on beats 2 and 4.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Add "x" on offbeats.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Play only on the first beat of each measure.

Putting it all together, the revised groove would look like this:

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|O---|S---|O---
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: -x--|x---| -x--|x---
```

I think this balances the addition of ride and snare while maintaining the original feel of the groove.

Here's the revised drum groove with both ride cymbal and snare drum prominently featured:

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|O---|S---|O---
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: -x--|x---| -x--|x---
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Snare Drum (S):** Added hard hits ("O") on beats 2 and 4, making it more prominent.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with soft closed hits ("x") on the offbeats, complementing the rhythm.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Simplified to play only on the first beat of each measure, reducing its prominence.
- **Hihat (H):** Maintained with soft closed hits ("x") on every eighth note, providing a steady rhythm.
- **Kick Drum (K) and Toms (T):** Kept unchanged to preserve the foundational rhythm.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both ride cymbal and snare drum featured prominently.
