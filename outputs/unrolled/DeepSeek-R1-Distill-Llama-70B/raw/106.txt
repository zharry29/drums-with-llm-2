Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove by adding both hihat and kick drum elements. Let me start by understanding the original groove and the edit request.

First, I'll look at the original drum groove provided by the user:

```
K: OOO-|----|OOO-|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: ----|----|----|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|----|O---|----  
R: ----|----|----|----  
```

From this, I can see that the kick drum (K) has a pattern in the first and third beats, the snare drum (S) is on the second and fourth beats, the crash cymbal (C) is on the first and third beats, and there's no hihat (H) or tom (T) activity.

The user's edit request is to make sure the groove has not only hihat but also kick. So, my goal is to enhance the hihat pattern and ensure the kick drum is well-integrated.

I'll start by adding the hihat. Since the user wants a prominent hihat, I'll use a combination of open and closed hits to create a dynamic rhythm. I'll alternate between open (O) and closed (x) hits to give it a lively feel.

Next, I'll look at the kick drum. The original pattern has the kick on the first and third beats, which is a good foundation. I'll keep that but maybe add a bit more complexity by adding a soft hit (o) on the second and fourth beats. This will give the kick a more driving rhythm without overpowering the other instruments.

The snare drum (S) is already on the second and fourth beats, which complements the kick nicely. I'll keep that as it is to maintain the backbeat.

For the crash cymbal (C), I'll keep it on the first and third beats to accentuate the start of each beat and add some brightness to the groove.

I'll leave the toms (T) and ride cymbal (R) as they are since the user didn't specify any changes to those.

Putting it all together, the updated groove will have a more intricate hihat pattern, a steady kick drum, and a balanced use of snare and crash cymbals.

Now, I'll translate this into the drum notation format, ensuring that each instrument's line reflects the changes I've made.
