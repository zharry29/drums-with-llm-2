Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both tom and snare. Let's see, the original groove has the kick, hihat, some toms, crash cymbal, but no snare. The edit request is to add snare. 

First, I'll look at where the snare can fit naturally. Typically, snares are on beats 2 and 4, so I'll check those positions. In the original, the snare line is all dashes, so I'll need to add hits there.

I'll start by adding 'S' on the snare line at the second and fourth beats of each bar. That should give it a backbeat feel. I'll make sure not to clash with the kick drum hits, which are already on beats 1 and 3.

Next, I'll ensure the toms are still present. The original has a tom hit on the third beat of the third bar, so I'll keep that. Adding the snare shouldn't interfere with that.

I'll also check the hihat and crash cymbal to make sure they're still playing correctly. The hihat has a steady 16th-note pattern, which is good. The crash is on beat 1 of each bar, which should complement the new snare hits.

Finally, I'll review the entire groove to make sure everything aligns and feels cohesive. Adding the snare on beats 2 and 4 should make the groove more dynamic without overpowering the existing elements.
