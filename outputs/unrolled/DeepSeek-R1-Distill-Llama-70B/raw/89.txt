Alright, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove by adding both cymbal and tom elements. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the user provided a drum notation system, which I should familiarize myself with. Each line represents a different drum or cymbal, and each character corresponds to a 16th note. The symbols denote different types of hits, which vary by instrument.

The user's current groove is:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

From this, I can see that the kick (K) has a solid pattern, the snare (S) has some hits, the toms (T) are active, but there's nothing on the crash cymbal (C) or ride cymbal (R).

The edit request is to add both cymbal and tom. Since the toms are already present, I need to ensure they remain or are enhanced, and add crash and ride cymbal hits.

Looking at the current groove, the crash cymbal (C) is completely empty, and the ride (R) is also empty. The toms (T) have a consistent "O-o-" pattern, which is good, but maybe I can add some variety or emphasize certain beats.

I should consider where to place the cymbal hits. Typically, crash cymbals are used on strong beats or at the start of a phrase to add accentuation. Ride cymbals often provide a steady rhythm, especially on the "x" or "X" notes, which denote closed or open hits.

So, I'll start by adding crash cymbal hits on beats 1 and 3 of each measure, using "O" for hard hits. For the ride cymbal, I'll add a steady rhythm, alternating between open and closed hits, maybe using "x" for closed and "X" for open to create a dynamic rhythm.

For the toms, since they're already present, I'll ensure they continue their pattern without conflict. I might adjust some hits to complement the cymbals, perhaps adding a soft hit ("o") on off-beats to add texture without overpowering the main rhythm.

Putting it all together, I'll update each line accordingly, making sure the crash and ride cymbals are incorporated seamlessly with the existing kick, snare, and tom patterns.

Finally, I'll review the updated groove to ensure it flows well and meets the user's request of having both cymbal and tom elements.
