Alright, let's tackle this drum groove edit. So, the user wants to modify an existing drum groove to include both cymbals and hihats. They provided a specific drum notation format, which I need to follow carefully.

First, I'll review the original groove they provided:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

From what I see, the Kick (K) and Snare (S) have some hits, and the Hihat (H) is being played on every 16th note with a hard closed hit (X). However, there are no cymbals (C or R) in this groove, which is what the user wants to change.

The user's edit request is to have "not only cymbal but also hihat." So, I need to ensure that both cymbals (Crash and Ride) and hihats are present in the groove. 

First, I'll think about where to place the cymbals. Typically, cymbals like the Crash are used to accentuate certain beats or to add color at specific points in the music. The Ride cymbal is often used to keep a steady rhythm, especially in jazz or fusion music.

Given that, I might want to add the Ride cymbal on offbeats to create a more dynamic rhythm. For the Crash cymbal, placing it on the first beat of each measure could add a nice accent.

Next, the hihats are already present, but they're being played with a hard closed hit (X) on every 16th note. To make the groove more interesting and less monotonous, I might vary the hihat articulation. Perhaps using a mix of hard closed hits (X) and soft closed hits (x) could add some texture.

Also, the Kick and Snare patterns seem pretty straightforward. I might consider adding a bit more complexity to the Kick drum to make the groove more engaging. Maybe adding a soft hit (o) on some offbeats could add some flavor.

Let's sketch out a possible revised groove:

- **Kick (K):** Keep the hard hits on beats 1 and 3, but add a soft hit on the "o" of beat 1 and maybe on the "o" of beat 3 to add some movement.
- **Snare (S):** Keep the backbeats on beats 2 and 4, but maybe add a soft open hit on the "o" of beat 2 to add some interest.
- **Hihat (H):** Alternate between hard closed hits (X) and soft closed hits (x) to create a more dynamic rhythm.
- **Crash (C):** Add a hard hit on the first beat of each measure to accentuate the start of each measure.
- **Ride (R):** Play steady 16th notes on the Ride cymbal to add a rhythmic foundation, using a mix of hard open hits (O) and soft open hits (o).

Putting this all together, here's how the revised groove might look:

@@@
K: O-o-|----|O-o-|----
S: ----|O-o-|----|O---
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

Wait, that doesn't seem quite right. The Ride cymbal is being played on every 16th note, which might be too busy. Maybe it's better to have the Ride cymbal play on the offbeats to complement the hihats.

Let me try again:

@@@
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--
@@@

This way, the Crash cymbal accents the start of each measure, and the Ride cymbal plays on the offbeats, creating a nice interplay between the two. The hihats maintain a steady rhythm with hard closed hits, which should work well with the Ride cymbal's offbeat pattern.

I think this should fulfill the user's request to have both cymbals and hihats in the groove.

To address the user's request of incorporating both cymbals and hihats into the drum groove, I have revised the original pattern to include these elements effectively. Here's the final version:

@@@
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: -O--|-O--|-O--|-O--
@@@

This revised groove features:
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Added on the first beat of each measure to provide accents.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Played on the offbeats to create a complementary rhythm with the hihats.
- **Hihat (H):** Maintains a steady rhythm with hard closed hits.
- **Kick (K) and Snare (S):** Retain their original patterns to preserve the groove's foundational rhythm.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with the inclusion of both cymbals and hihats.
