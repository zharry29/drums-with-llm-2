Alright, I need to help the user create a new drum groove based on their edit request. The original groove has the kick, snare, and hihat, but the user wants to add both hihat and tom. Let me break this down.

First, I'll look at the original groove:
- **Kick (K):** O--O|----|--O-|----
- **Snare (S):** ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- **Hihat (H):** X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----
- **Crash (C):** ----|----|----|----
- **Ride (R):** ----|----|----|----

The user wants to add both hihat and tom. The hihat is already present, so I need to enhance it and add the tom.

Looking at the hihat line, it's already using a steady 16th-note pattern with "X-x-" which is a closed hit. To make it more dynamic, I can vary it a bit, maybe using a mix of closed and open hits. For the tom, I need to add hits on the off-beats to give it some movement.

I'll adjust the hihat to have a mix of closed and open hits, perhaps using "x-X-x-" to create some variation. For the toms, I'll add soft hits on beats 3 and 7 to add flavor without overpowering the main rhythm.

So, the updated lines would be:
- **Hihat (H):** x-X-x-|x-X-x-|x-X-x-|x-X-x-
- **Toms (T):** ----|---o|----|---o

This way, the hihat becomes more interesting with a mix of closed and open hits, and the toms add subtle accents that complement the snare and kick without overwhelming them.

I'll make sure the rest of the instruments stay the same to maintain the original feel while incorporating the requested changes.
