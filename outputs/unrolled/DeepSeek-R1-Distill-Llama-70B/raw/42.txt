Alright, I need to add some ride cymbal to this drum groove. Let me look at the current groove first.

The kick drum (K) has a steady pattern on beats 1 and 3. The snare drum (S) is on beats 2 and 4, which is pretty standard for a backbeat. The hihat (H) is playing a closed hit on every 16th note, which gives a driving rhythm. The toms (T) and crash cymbal (C) are not being used, and the ride cymbal (R) is completely silent.

The user wants to add some ride to the groove. The ride cymbal typically adds a sustained rhythmic pattern, often on the 'and' of beats or in a shuffle feel. Since the hihat is already playing a steady closed pattern, adding ride might complement it by adding some texture or rhythmic interest.

I should consider where to place the ride hits. Maybe on the off-beats or in a syncopated rhythm to add flavor. I don't want to clash with the snare or kick, so perhaps placing it on the 'e' and 'a' counts in a 16th note rhythm.

Looking at the current R line, it's all dashes, meaning no ride is played. I'll add some 'x' or 'X' to indicate soft or hard closed hits on the ride cymbal. Maybe start with a soft hit on the 'e' of beat 1 and alternate to create a subtle rhythm.

So, the final ride line could look like: x---|x---|x---|x---. This adds a soft closed ride on the 'e' of each beat, providing a steady but subtle rhythm without overpowering the existing hihat pattern.
