Okay, so I need to edit this drum groove to include both hihat and tom. Let me start by looking at the original groove provided.

The original groove is:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

From this, I can see that the hihat (H) is already present with a steady 16th-note pattern. The tom (T) has a hit on the third beat of the third bar. The edit request is to make sure the groove has not only hihat but also tom. So, I need to enhance the tom hits.

I'll start by analyzing each instrument's current pattern:

- **Kick (K):** Has a solid pattern with hits on beats 1 and 2 in the first bar, beat 3 in the second, and beats 1 and 2 in the fourth. This provides a strong foundation.
- **Snare (S):** Only has a hit on the third beat of the third bar. This is minimal, so maybe adding more snare hits could improve the groove, but the request is about hihat and tom.
- **Hihat (H):** A steady x-x- pattern throughout, which is good but could be made more interesting.
- **Toms (T):** Only one hit on the third beat of the third bar. To make the groove have more tom presence, I should add more tom hits, perhaps on off-beats or in a syncopated pattern.
- **Crash (C):** Hits on the first beat of each bar, which is standard for crashes.
- **Ride (R):** No hits; this could be added to enhance the rhythm.

Given the edit request, my focus is on enhancing the hihat and tom. Here's how I can approach it:

1. **Hihat (H):** The current pattern is x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-. To make it more dynamic, I can vary it by adding some open hits (O) and closed hits (X or x). For example, using a pattern like X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x- adds some variety and keeps the rhythm interesting.

2. **Toms (T):** The current pattern has only one hit. I can add more tom hits to create a more driving rhythm. Maybe adding hits on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4 in each bar. This would look like o---|o---|o---|o--- in the tom line.

Putting it all together, the new groove would look like this:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: o---|o---|o---|o---
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This way, the hihat has a more varied and dynamic pattern, and the toms are more active, contributing to a fuller sound.
