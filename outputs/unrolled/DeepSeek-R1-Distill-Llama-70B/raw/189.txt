Okay, so I need to help the user modify their drum groove based on their edit request. Let's see what they're asking for. The user provided a drum groove and wants it edited to include both tom and snare. 

First, I'll look at the original groove they provided. It has the following parts:

- **Kick (K):** o---|--o-|o---|--o- 
  - This seems like a soft kick pattern on beats 2 and 4 in each measure.

- **Snare (S):** ----|X---|--X-|----
  - Snare is on the second and fourth beats of the second measure with hard sidesticks (X).

- **Hihat (H):** ----|x---|----|x---
  - Hihat is playing on the second and fourth beats with soft closed hits (x).

- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----
  - No tom hits in the original groove.

- **Crash (C):** ----|----|----|----
  - No crash cymbal hits.

- **Ride (R):** x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
  - Ride is playing a mix of soft and hard closed hits.

The edit request is to have "not only tom but also snare." So, I need to add tom hits and ensure the snare is present. 

Looking at the original, the snare is already there, so maybe they want it to be more prominent or add more hits. The tom is completely absent, so I'll need to add that.

I'll start by deciding where to place the snare and tom hits. Typically, in a groove, the snare is on beats 2 and 4, so I'll keep that. For the tom, adding hits on off-beats or specific rhythmic points can add flavor. Maybe on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4.

I'll also consider the hihat pattern to keep it steady, so I'll make sure the hihat is playing on every 16th note. The ride can continue as is, but maybe add a few open hits for variety.

For the crash, it's not mentioned, so I'll leave it out unless it's needed for accents. But since the user didn't mention it, I'll focus on snare and tom.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust each line:

- **Kick (K):** Keep the soft hits on beats 2 and 4.
- **Snare (S):** Add soft open hits (o) on beats 2 and 4, maybe on the "and" of beat 2 and 4 for more rhythm.
- **Hihat (H):** Change to a steady 16th note pattern with soft closed hits (x).
- **Toms (T):** Add soft hits on the "and" of beats 2 and 4.
- **Crash (C):** Keep it as is since it's not requested.
- **Ride (R):** Keep the mix of soft and hard closed hits, maybe adding an open hit on beat 1 for variety.

I'll make sure the pattern flows well and doesn't clash with the kick and snare. Testing it out, the groove should now have both snare and tom hits, making it more dynamic.
