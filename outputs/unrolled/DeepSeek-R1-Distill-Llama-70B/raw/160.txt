Alright, so I need to help edit a drum groove based on the user's request. The user provided a drum notation system and a specific groove that needs to be modified. The edit request is to ensure that the groove has not only cymbal but also kick. 

First, I need to understand the drum notation system. Each line represents a different drum or cymbal: K for kick, S for snare, H for hihat, T for toms, C for crash cymbal, and R for ride cymbal. Each character in a line represents a 16th note, and the characters are separated by | to denote beats. There are 16 characters per line, not counting the |, which makes sense because there are 16 16th notes in a bar, divided into 4 beats of 4 notes each.

Each character can be a '-', which means the instrument isn't played on that note. When played, the character indicates the articulation, which varies by instrument. For example, for the kick drum (K), 'O' is a hard hit, and 'o' is a soft hit. For the snare drum (S), 'O' is a hard hit, 'o' is a soft open hit, and 'X' and 'x' are hard and soft sidestick hits, respectively. The hihat (H) has 'O' for a hard open hit, 'o' for a soft open hit, and 'X' and 'x' for hard and soft closed hits. Toms (T) use 'O' for a hard hit and 'o' for a soft hit. Crash cymbal (C) and ride cymbal (R) have similar notation, with 'O' for a hard hit and 'o' for a soft hit, and for the ride, 'X' and 'x' are used for closed hits on the bow.

Now, looking at the provided drum groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

I need to ensure that the groove has not only cymbal but also kick. Currently, the kick drum (K) is being used with soft hits ('o'), but perhaps the user wants more prominent or additional kick hits. The crash cymbal (C) is not used at all in this groove, and the ride cymbal (R) is being used extensively. The hihat (H) is used sparsely, and the snare (S) has some sidestick hits but no main snare hits.

Given the edit request, I need to enhance the groove by adding more kick drum hits and possibly incorporate crash cymbals to meet the requirement of having not only cymbals but also kick. The user might want a more dynamic rhythm section with both kick and cymbal elements.

So, my plan is to:

1. Add more kick drum hits where appropriate, perhaps on beats 1 and 3 of each measure, to give a solid foundation.
2. Incorporate crash cymbals on key accents, maybe at the beginning of each measure or on the '1' of each beat to add impact.
3. Ensure that the hihat pattern is consistent to maintain the rhythmic flow.
4. Keep the snare drum elements as they are since they already provide some interest with the sidestick hits.
5. Adjust the ride cymbal pattern if necessary, but it seems to be providing a good rhythmic pattern already.

I should also make sure that the notation adheres to the 16th note structure and that each beat is correctly separated by the '|' character.

After making these adjustments, I'll present the revised drum groove within the @@@ notation as specified.
