Okay, I need to help the user by editing their drum groove to include both ride and hihat. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user provided a drum groove and wants to add more ride and hihat. The original groove has the ride cymbal (R) and hihat (H) lines, but they might not be prominent enough. My task is to enhance these elements without losing the existing rhythm.

First, I'll look at the current H and R lines. The hihat is mostly empty, so adding some closed hits (x) on the off-beats would give it a more dynamic feel. For the ride cymbal, I notice it's already present but could be more consistent. Adding some closed hits (x) and open hits (X) on the ride will make it more prominent.

I'll go through each beat and decide where to place the x's in the hihat line to keep the rhythm steady. Then, I'll adjust the ride cymbal line to have a mix of open and closed hits, maybe alternating between X and x to add texture.

I should also ensure that the changes don't clash with the existing kick (K) and snare (S) patterns. Keeping the hihat and ride cymbal in sync with the other instruments is crucial for a cohesive sound.

After making these changes, I'll review the updated groove to make sure it flows well and meets the user's request. Finally, I'll present the revised groove in the correct notation.
