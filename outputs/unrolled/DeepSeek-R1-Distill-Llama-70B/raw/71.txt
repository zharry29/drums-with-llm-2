Okay, I need to help the user by editing their drum groove to include both ride and hihat. Let me look at the original groove they provided. 

The groove is:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

I notice that the H line is all dashes, meaning the hihat isn't being played at all. The R line is also all dashes except for the first character, so the ride isn't being used much either. The user wants to add both ride and hihat to the groove.

First, I'll think about the hihat. In the original, the hihat is absent, so I'll need to add some hits there. Maybe a basic rhythm like "x-x-" repeated would give it a steady feel. That way, the hihat is providing a consistent background rhythm.

Next, the ride cymbal. The user wants it to be present, so I'll add some ride hits. Maybe on the off-beats to give it some movement. I'll alternate between 'x' and 'X' to vary the dynamics a bit, making it more interesting.

I'll also check the other instruments to ensure they're balanced. The kick and snare seem to have a good foundation, and the crash cymbal is already providing accents. Adding the hihat and ride should enhance the overall rhythm without overpowering the existing elements.

So, I'll update the H line with a repeating "x-x-" pattern and the R line with a mix of 'x' and 'X' to add both soft and hard hits on the ride. This should make the groove more dynamic and meet the user's request.
