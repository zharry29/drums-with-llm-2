Alright, let's tackle this edit request. The user wants to modify the given drum groove by adding both tom and kick. I'll start by analyzing the original groove to understand where the kick and tom hits are currently placed.

Looking at the original groove, I see that the kick (K) is already present in the first, third, and fourth beats. The tom (T) is not present, so I'll need to add it. The snare (S) and hihat (H) are also part of the groove, but the user's request is specifically about adding tom and kick, so I'll focus on those.

I'll decide where to place the tom hits. Since the kick is on beats 1, 3, and 4, adding the tom on the off-beats or on the second beat could create a nice balance. I'll add a soft tom hit (o) on the second beat of each measure. This will complement the kick without overpowering it.

For the kick, I notice that it's already strong, but to emphasize it further, I'll ensure it's present in all four beats. This means adding a kick hit on the second beat as well. I'll use a soft hit (o) on the second beat to keep the rhythm dynamic but not too overwhelming.

I'll also check the other instruments to ensure they complement the new additions. The snare and hihat can remain as they are, providing the necessary backbeat and rhythm without clashing with the new tom and kick hits.

Finally, I'll review the updated groove to make sure it flows well and meets the user's request. The kick is now present in all four beats, with varying intensities, and the tom adds a nice texture on the off-beats.
