Alright, so I need to modify the given drum groove to include both hihat and snare. Let me look at the original groove first.

The original has K, S, H, T, C, R. The H line is already active with "x-x-" in each beat, which is a soft closed hihat on every 8th note. That's good. But the S (snare) line is mostly empty except for a "S" in the third beat. Wait, no, looking again, the original S line is "----|----|S---|----", so only the third beat has a snare. But the user wants the groove to have not only hihat but also snare. So I think they want the snare to be more present, maybe on beats 2 and 4, which is common in many grooves.

So, I'll need to add snare hits. Let me think about where to place them. Typically, snares are on beats 2 and 4 in a 4/4 time. So in each measure, that would be the second and fourth beats. Each beat is four 16th notes, so the snare would fall on the third character of each beat, I think. Wait, no, each beat is four 16th notes, so the first note is the downbeat, then the next three are subdivisions. So the snare on beat 2 would be the 5th character, and beat 4 would be the 13th character in the 16-note bar.

Looking at the original S line: "----|----|S---|----". So the S is on the third beat, which is the 9th character. Maybe that's a backbeat, but perhaps the user wants more snare presence. So I'll add snares on beats 2 and 4.

I'll go through each beat. Let's break down the S line into four beats:

Beat 1: "----" – no snare.
Beat 2: "----" – I'll add a snare on the third note, so it becomes "--S-".
Beat 3: "S---" – that's already a snare on the first note, but maybe I should adjust it to be on the second beat, so perhaps move it to the third note as well, making it "--S-".
Wait, no, the original has "S---" in the third beat, which is the 9th character. If I want snares on beats 2 and 4, I should adjust accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me map the 16 notes:

Each beat is four notes, so:

Beat 1: notes 1-4
Beat 2: notes 5-8
Beat 3: notes 9-12
Beat 4: notes 13-16

So the snare on beat 2 would be note 5, and on beat 4 would be note 13.

Looking at the original S line:

"----|----|S---|----"

So note 9 is an 'S', which is the start of beat 3. I think the user wants snares on beats 2 and 4, so I'll add 'S' at note 5 and note 13.

So the S line would become:

"----|S---|----|S---"

But wait, that's four beats, each with four notes. So the S line would be:

Beat 1: "----"
Beat 2: "S---"
Beat 3: "----"
Beat 4: "S---"

Putting it together: "----|S---|----|S---"

But in the original, beat 3 had an 'S' at note 9, which is the first note of beat 3. Maybe I should keep that as well, but the user's edit is to have both hihat and snare, so perhaps adding snares on beats 2 and 4 without removing the existing one. Alternatively, maybe the original S line was a typo, but I think the user wants to add snares on 2 and 4, so I'll adjust accordingly.

Wait, the original S line is "----|----|S---|----", so note 9 is 'S'. If I want to add snares on beats 2 and 4, that's notes 5 and 13. So the S line becomes:

Notes 5: 'S', 9: 'S', 13: 'S'.

So each beat would be:

Beat 1: "----"
Beat 2: "S---"
Beat 3: "S---"
Beat 4: "S---"

Wait, no. Each beat is four notes, so:

Beat 2 starts at note 5, so the second beat's line is "S---" (notes 5-8).

Beat 3 starts at note 9, so "S---" (notes 9-12).

Beat 4 starts at note 13, so "S---" (notes 13-16).

Wait, but that would mean three snares: beats 2, 3, and 4. But the user just wants to add snare, so maybe two snares on beats 2 and 4, keeping the original on beat 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants a more standard groove with snares on 2 and 4, so I'll adjust to have snares on those beats.

So the S line would be:

"----|S---|----|S---"

But then, in the original, beat 3 had an 'S', which is note 9. If I change it to "----", I'm removing that. Alternatively, perhaps I should keep the original and add the snares on 2 and 4.

Wait, perhaps the original S line is "----|----|S---|----", so only note 9 is 'S'. The user wants to add more snares, so adding on beats 2 and 4 would mean notes 5 and 13.

So the S line becomes:

"----|S---|S---|S---"

But that would have snares on beats 2, 3, and 4, which might be too much. Alternatively, maybe just adding on beats 2 and 4, so the S line would be:

"----|S---|----|S---"

But then the original note 9 'S' is removed. Hmm, perhaps the user wants to keep the existing snare and add more. So perhaps the S line should have snares on beats 2, 3, and 4.

Alternatively, maybe the original S line was a mistake, and the user wants a more standard pattern with snares on 2 and 4.

I think the best approach is to add snares on beats 2 and 4, so the S line becomes:

"----|S---|----|S---"

But that would mean removing the original snare on beat 3. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to keep that as well, making it three snares. I'm not sure, but I think the main point is to have snares on 2 and 4, so I'll proceed with that.

Now, looking at the H line, which is "x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-", which is a steady 8th note hihat pattern. That's good, but perhaps to make it more interesting, I could vary it a bit, maybe opening on certain beats. But the user didn't specify changing the hihat, just adding snare, so I'll leave the H line as is.

For the K line, the original is "-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-". Let me see:

Beat 1: "-O--" – note 2 is 'O'
Beat 2: "OO--" – notes 5 and 6 are 'O's
Beat 3: "---O" – note 12 is 'O'
Beat 4: "-OO-" – notes 13 and 14 are 'O's

This is a busy kick pattern. Maybe to make room for the snare, I could simplify it a bit, but the user didn't specify changing the kick, so I'll leave it as is.

The T line is "----|----|---O|----", so only note 12 is 'O'. That's fine.

The C line is "O---|O---|O---|O---", which is a crash on every beat 1. That's a standard approach, but perhaps to make it more dynamic, I could change some to 'o' for softer hits, but again, the user didn't specify, so I'll leave it.

The R line is all '----', so no ride. That's fine.

So, putting it all together, the only change is the S line. I'll update it to have snares on beats 2 and 4, so the S line becomes:

"----|S---|----|S---"

Wait, but in the original, the S line was "----|----|S---|----", so note 9 was 'S'. If I change it to "----|S---|----|S---", I'm moving the snare from beat 3 to beats 2 and 4. Alternatively, perhaps I should add snares on beats 2 and 4 without removing the one on beat 3. So the S line would have 'S' on notes 5, 9, and 13.

So the S line would be:

"----|S---|S---|S---"

But that's three snares, which might be too much. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants a more standard backbeat on 2 and 4, so I'll go with that.

So the final S line is "----|S---|----|S---"

Wait, but that would mean only two snares. Let me confirm:

Each beat is four notes, so:

Beat 1: notes 1-4: "----" – no snare
Beat 2: notes 5-8: "S---" – snare on note 5
Beat 3: notes 9-12: "----" – no snare
Beat 4: notes 13-16: "S---" – snare on note 13

Yes, that adds snares on beats 2 and 4, which is what the user wants. So I'll update the S line accordingly.
