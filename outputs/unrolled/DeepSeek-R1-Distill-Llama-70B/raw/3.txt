Alright, I need to add some tom hits to this drum groove. Let me look at the current groove first.

The kick drum (K) has hits on beats 1 and 3 in the first measure, and on beat 3 in the second measure. The snare drum (S) has a pattern that includes both hard and soft hits, with some syncopation. The hihat (H) is mostly inactive, which is a bit unusual, but it leaves room for other instruments to shine. The crash cymbal (C) and ride cymbal (R) are also quiet, except for the ride which has a soft open hit on the bell in the first measure and a hard open hit on the bell in the second measure.

The toms (T) are completely silent in the current groove, so adding some hits here will definitely add flavor to the rhythm. Since the kick and snare are already providing a solid foundation, the toms can complement them by adding some rhythmic interest, perhaps on off-beats or to create a fill-like pattern.

I'll start by looking at where the toms can fit without clashing with the existing hits. In the first measure, after the kick on beat 1, adding a soft tom hit on the "and" of beat 1 (the second 16th note) could create a nice flow. Similarly, on beat 3, after the kick, adding another soft tom hit on the "and" of beat 3 might work well.

In the second measure, the kick is on beat 3 again, so adding a soft tom hit on the "and" of beat 3 there as well could maintain consistency. I'll avoid adding too many hits to keep the groove from becoming too busy, especially since the hihat is quiet.

I'll represent soft hits with a lowercase "o" on the T line. So, in the first measure, I'll add an "o" on the second 16th note of beat 1 and the second 16th note of beat 3. In the second measure, I'll add an "o" on the second 16th note of beat 3.

This should add a subtle, rhythmic interest to the groove without overpowering the existing instruments. Let me put it all together now.
