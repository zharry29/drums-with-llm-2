Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove to include both ride cymbal and snare drum. Let me first understand the original groove and the request.

The original groove has:
- Kick drum with a pattern O---|---o|O-O-|----
- Snare drum with ----|O---|----|O---
- Hihat with --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- Toms and Crash Cymbal are silent
- Ride Cymbal is silent

The user wants the groove to have not only ride but also snare. So, I need to enhance the ride cymbal's presence while ensuring the snare is prominent.

First, I'll look at the snare drum. It's already playing on beats 2 and 4, which is good. Maybe I can add some flavor with sidestick hits or vary the articulation to make it more dynamic.

Next, the ride cymbal. It's currently silent, so I need to add it. Ride cymbal usually plays steady rhythms, often on offbeats. I can add soft closed hits on the offbeats and maybe some harder hits on key beats to make it stand out.

I should also consider the hihat. It's playing a dynamic pattern with both open and closed hits. To make the ride more prominent, I might simplify the hihat to soft closed hits, letting the ride take the lead.

I'll also check the kick drum and toms to ensure they're providing a solid foundation without overpowering the snare and ride.

So, my plan is:
1. Keep the kick drum pattern as is for consistency.
2. Enhance the snare drum with additional hits or different articulations.
3. Add ride cymbal with a steady pattern, using soft and hard hits.
4. Simplify the hihat to support without competing.
5. Keep toms and crash cymbal silent to focus on the main elements.

I'll draft the new groove with these changes and ensure it's balanced and dynamic.

Here's the revised drum groove with both ride cymbal and snare drum prominently featured:

```
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
R: x-X-x|X-x-X|x-X-x|X-x-X
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Snare Drum (S):** Maintained its backbeats on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O").
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with a dynamic pattern alternating between soft ("x") and hard ("X") closed hits, complementing the snare and adding texture.
- **Hihat (H):** Simplified to soft closed hits ("x") on every eighth note, providing a steady rhythm without overpowering the ride cymbal.
- **Kick Drum (K):** Kept unchanged to provide a solid foundation on beats 1 and 3.
- **Toms (T) and Crash Cymbal (C):** Kept silent to focus on the snare and ride cymbal.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both ride cymbal and snare drum featured prominently.
