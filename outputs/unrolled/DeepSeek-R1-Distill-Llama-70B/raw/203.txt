Alright, I need to help the user edit their drum groove based on their request. The user provided a drum groove and wants it modified to include both snare and hihat. Let me first understand the existing groove and then figure out how to incorporate the requested changes.

Looking at the provided drum groove, here's what each instrument is doing:

- **Kick (K):** o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
  It's playing on the 2nd and 4th beats in each measure, with a soft hit.

- **Snare (S):** ----|X---|--X-|----  
  It's playing on the 2nd and 4th beats with a hard sidestick.

- **Hihat (H):** ----|x---|----|x---  
  It's playing on the 2nd and 4th beats with a soft closed hit.

- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----  
  Not playing at all.

- **Crash Cymbal (C):** ----|----|----|----  
  Not playing at all.

- **Ride Cymbal (R):** x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-  
  Playing a mix of soft and hard closed hits.

The user wants the groove to have not only snare but also hihat. Currently, both snare and hihat are present, but perhaps they want a more prominent or additional hihat pattern. Maybe they want a more driving rhythm or a different feel.

I'll consider enhancing the hihat part to make it more dynamic. Perhaps adding more hits or varying the articulation between open and closed hits. For the snare, I can ensure it's clearly present and maybe add some variety in its hits.

I should also check if the hihat is playing consistently throughout the bar. In the current groove, it's only on beats 2 and 4, which is a bit sparse. Adding more hits on off-beats could make the groove more engaging.

Maybe I'll change the hihat pattern to something like x-x-x-x, with a mix of open and closed hits to add texture. For the snare, I'll keep it on beats 2 and 4 but maybe add a sidestick on other beats for more movement.

I also notice the ride cymbal is playing a pattern. I'll keep that as it adds a nice rhythm without overpowering the other instruments.

Finally, I'll make sure the kick drum maintains its soft hits to keep the groove subtle but steady.
