Okay, I need to help the user edit their drum groove by adding both tom and kick. Let me start by understanding the current groove and the edit request.

Looking at the provided groove, the kick (K) and snare (S) are already present, but the toms (T) are not. The user wants to add tom hits, so I'll need to incorporate the T line into the groove.

First, I'll review the existing K and T lines. The kick has a pattern with hits on beats 1 and 3, and some syncopation. The toms are currently not played, so I need to add hits on the T line that complement the kick and snare.

I'll consider where to place the tom hits. Maybe on off-beats or to add accents. I'll also ensure that the tom hits don't clash with the kick and snare hits, creating a balanced rhythm.

I'll go through each beat and decide where to add the tom hits, using 'O' for hard hits and 'o' for softer ones. I'll make sure the pattern flows well and enhances the overall groove without overpowering the existing instruments.

Finally, I'll update the T line with the new hits and present the revised groove to the user.
