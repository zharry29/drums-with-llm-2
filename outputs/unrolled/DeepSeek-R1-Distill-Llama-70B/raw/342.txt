Okay, so I need to help this user edit their drum groove. They don't want any snare or cymbals, which means I need to remove all the hits from those instruments. Let me look at the original groove.

First, I see the kick drum pattern is "O--O|----|--O-|----". I'll keep that as it is since they didn't mention removing the kick. 

Next, the snare drum is "----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o". Since they don't want any snare, I'll set all the snare hits to "-", so it becomes "----|----|----|----".

The hihat is "----|----|----|----", which is already silent, so no changes needed there.

Toms are "----|----|----|----", also silent, so nothing to change.

Crash cymbal is "----|----|----|----", so I'll leave it as is since it's already silent.

Ride cymbal is "o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-". Since they don't want any cymbals, I'll set all ride hits to "-", making it "----|----|----|----".

Putting it all together, the final groove will have only the kick drum and no snare or cymbals.
</think>

```
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This groove now features:
- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintains its original pattern to provide a solid foundation.
- **Snare Drum (S), Hihat (H), Toms (T), Crash Cymbal (C), and Ride Cymbal (R):** All silenced as per the request.

This arrangement creates a minimalist rhythm focused solely on the kick drum without any snare or cymbal hits.
