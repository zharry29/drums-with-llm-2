Okay, I need to help the user by editing their drum groove to include both cymbal and ride. Let me start by understanding the current groove they've provided.

Looking at the given groove:
- **K**: O---|----|O---|---- (Kick drum has hits on the 1st and 3rd beats)
- **S**: ----|O---|----|O--- (Snare drum has hits on the 2nd and 4th beats)
- **H**: X---|X---|X---|X--- (Hihat is played on every 16th note, seems like a closed hit)
- **T**: ----|----|----|---- (No toms)
- **C**: ----|----|----|---- (No crash cymbal)
- **R**: ----|----|----|---- (No ride cymbal)

The edit request is to add both cymbal and ride. From the notation, I know that cymbals (C) and ride (R) can be added with specific articulations. 

First, I'll add the crash cymbal (C) on the 1st beat to give it a strong accent. Then, I'll incorporate the ride cymbal (R) to add a rhythmic pattern. Since the ride can have open (O) or closed (X/x) hits, I'll use a mix to create a dynamic feel.

So, I'll place an 'O' on the ride cymbal at specific points to add accents and use 'X' for a steady rhythm. I'll also ensure the hihat (H) continues to provide the foundational rhythm without overpowering the new elements.

Finally, I'll make sure the kick (K) and snare (S) remain as the backbone of the groove while integrating the cymbal and ride effectively.
