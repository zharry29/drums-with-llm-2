Okay, let's see. I need to edit the given drum groove to include both tom and snare. The original groove has the kick, snare, hihat, and crash cymbal, but I need to make sure the snare and tom are both present.

First, looking at the kick drum (K) line: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO. It seems pretty active, which is good. The snare (S) is already there with some hits, but maybe I can add more to make it more prominent. 

The hihat (H) is completely empty, so I should add some rhythm there to keep the groove moving. Maybe a steady 16th-note pattern with closed hits (x) would work.

For the tom (T), it's completely empty in the original. I should add some tom hits to give the groove more texture. Maybe on the off-beats or in a syncopated pattern.

The crash cymbal (C) is already present, which is great. It adds accents to the beats. The ride cymbal (R) is also empty, so adding some ride hits could add more interest to the rhythm.

Putting it all together, I'll add a steady hihat pattern, introduce some snare hits on beats 2 and 4, add tom hits for texture, and maybe some ride cymbal hits to fill it out.
