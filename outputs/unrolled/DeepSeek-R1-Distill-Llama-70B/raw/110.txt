Okay, so I need to help the user edit their drum groove by adding both tom and kick. Let me start by understanding the current groove they've provided.

Looking at the groove, the kick (K) has a pattern with some hits, the snare (S) has a more dynamic pattern with open and soft hits, the hihat (H) is pretty active, but the toms (T) are mostly inactive, and the cymbals (C) and ride (R) are not used much.

The user wants to add more tom hits and also ensure the kick is present. So, I need to enhance the tom hits without making it too overwhelming and make sure the kick is well-integrated.

I'll start by looking at the current T line:
T: ----|----|----|----

I'll add some hits to the toms, maybe on beats 2 and 4 to complement the kick. Let's say I add a soft hit (o) on the second beat of each measure and a hard hit (O) on the fourth beat. So, the T line becomes:
T: ----|o---|----|O---

Next, I'll check the kick (K) to make sure it's prominent. The current K line is:
K: O--O|----|--O-|----

I might add a soft kick (o) on the second beat of the first measure to add some dynamics. So, the K line becomes:
K: O--O|o---|--O-|----

I'll also ensure that the hihat (H) is still active to keep the rhythm going. The current H line is:
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

I'll keep it as is to maintain the rhythm.

Putting it all together, the updated groove should have more tom hits and a solid kick presence. I'll make sure the other instruments like snare and cymbals are adjusted accordingly to balance the sound.

So, the final edited groove with the added tom and kick hits would look like this:

@@@  
K: O--O|o---|--O-|----  
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o  
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-  
T: ----|o---|----|O---  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

This should meet the user's request by incorporating both the tom and kick effectively into the groove.
