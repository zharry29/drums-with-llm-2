Alright, I need to help the user by composing a drum groove that includes both snare and cymbals. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, I'll review the provided drum notation to see how each instrument is represented. The user has given a sample bar of drum beats, which includes lines for Kick, Snare, Hihat, Toms, Crash cymbal, and Ride cymbal. Each character in these lines represents a 16th note, and the symbols denote different articulations specific to each instrument.

The user's current drum groove is:

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
```

The edit request is to modify this groove so that it includes both snare and cymbals. Currently, the snare is present with a sidestick on beat 3, and the crash cymbal is already featured prominently. The ride cymbal is not used in the original groove.

My goal is to ensure that both the snare and cymbals (both crash and ride) are included and featured prominently. 

First, I'll look at the snare drum. In the current groove, it's only played on beat 3 with a sidestick ("S"). To make it more prominent, I can add more snare hits, perhaps on beats 2 and 4 with hard hits ("O") to create a backbeat.

Next, the cymbals. The crash cymbal is already present on every beat 1. To incorporate the ride cymbal, I can add it on the offbeats with a mix of soft ("x") and hard ("X") hits to add texture and interest without overpowering the crash cymbal.

I'll also consider the other instruments:
- **Kick Drum (K):** It's currently playing on beats 2 and 4 with a soft hit ("O") and a hard hit ("O") on beat 3. I'll keep this pattern to maintain the foundation.
- **Hihat (H):** It's playing a steady rhythm with soft and hard closed hits. I'll keep this to support the rhythm.
- **Toms (T):** It's playing on beat 3 and 4 of the third measure. I'll keep this to add flavor.

Now, I'll modify the snare and ride cymbal lines:

1. **Snare Drum (S):** Change from `----|----|S---|----` to `----|O---|----|O---` to add hard hits on beats 2 and 4.
2. **Ride Cymbal (R):** Change from `----|----|----|----` to `x---|X---|x---|X---` to add a dynamic pattern.

I'll ensure that the crash cymbal remains on beat 1 to maintain its prominence.

After making these changes, the groove should have a balanced mix of snare and cymbals, fulfilling the user's request.

Here's the final drum groove with both snare and cymbals prominently featured:

```
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: x---|X---|x---|X---
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

- **Snare Drum (S):** Added hard hits ("O") on beats 2 and 4, creating a driving backbeat.
- **Ride Cymbal (R):** Added with a dynamic pattern alternating between soft ("x") and hard ("X") hits, complementing the crash cymbal.
- **Crash Cymbal (C):** Simplified to play on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits ("O"), providing strong accents.
- **Kick Drum (K):** Maintained its original pattern to provide a solid foundation.
- **Hihat (H):** Kept its steady rhythm with soft and hard closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** Maintained their original pattern for added flavor.

This arrangement ensures a balanced and dynamic rhythm section with both snare and cymbals featured prominently.
