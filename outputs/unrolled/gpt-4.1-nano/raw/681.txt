**Thought process:**

- To add a cymbal hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `O---` to `O---` (Crash cymbal).
- To add a tom in the very beginning, change the first beat of T from `----` to `O---` (tom hit).
- Both should be played simultaneously at the start.

**Implementation:**

- T: from `----` to `O---`
- C: from `O---` to `O---` (already a crash, so no change needed, just ensure it exists in the first beat)

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:** The first beat now features both a tom and a cymbal hit, fulfilling the request.
