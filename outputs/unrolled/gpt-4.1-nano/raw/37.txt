Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': hits on beats 1, 2, and 4.
- Snare 'S': only in the third measure.
- Hi-hat 'H': no hits.
- Toms 'T': plays on every beat with alternating soft and hard hits.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': no hits.

**Goal:** Add some ride cymbal to the groove.

Since 'R' is currently black, I can add ride hits to the 'R' line to create a ride pattern.

**Approach:**
- Add ride hits in a consistent pattern, e.g., playing on beats 2 and 4 with whole or half notes.
- Use 'O' for hard ride hits or 'o' for softer ones.

**Implementation:**
- Insert ride hits on beats 2 and 4 in the 'R' line, perhaps as 'O---' on beat 2 and 'O---' on beat 4, or spread evenly.

Let's do:

- R: ----|--O-|----|--O-

This distributes ride hits on the off-beats of 2 and 4, giving a steady ride pattern.

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|--O-|----|--O-

This adds a simple ride cymbal pattern to the groove, fulfilling the request to "add some ride."
