Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1, 2, and 3 with various articulations (hard and soft).
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 and 4, with some open and sidestick hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays on every beat with alternating open and closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on beat 1.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Request:** no hi-hat or snare.

This means removing lines **S** and **H** altogether.

**Remaining sounds:** Kick, Toms, Cymbals, Ride.

Since T, C, and R are silent in this groove, the only instrument with hits is the Kick.

### Final steps:
- Remove S and H lines.
- Keep only K, C, R, T (even if silent), but since they are silent, only K remains active.

### Final groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----

This pattern contains just the kick drum, with no snare or hi-hat, satisfying your request to remove them.

**Final answer:**
