**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `OOO-`, `--O-`, `OOO-`, `OOO`
  - Snare (S): `----`, `O---`, `----`, `O---`
  - Hi-hat (H): all rests
  - Toms (T): all rests
  - Crash (C): hits on first, second, third, fourth beats
  - Ride (R): all rests

- Request:
  - Add a snare hit and a ride hit in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Place a snare (`O`) at the first subdivision in S
  - Place a ride (`O`) at the first subdivision in R

**Final edited groove:**

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: O---|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|----|----|----

**This now includes a snare hit and a ride hit at the very beginning, per the request.**
