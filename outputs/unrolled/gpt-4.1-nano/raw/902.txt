Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** OOO- | --O- | OOO- | OOO
- **Snare (S):** ---- | O--- | ---- | O---
- **Hi-hat (H):** ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
- **Toms (T):** ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
- **Cymbal (C):** O--- | O--- | O--- | O---
- **Ride (R):** ---- | ---- | ---- | ----

The task requires placing a snare hit on every 16th note in the second beat, i.e., on positions 5-8 in the second beat segment.

---

### Step-by-step:

- The second beat is **O---** (beat 2), which spans notes 5-8.
- Currently, no snare hits are on beat 2.
- To meet the requirement, we need to place snare hits on every 16th note of beat 2, i.e., on notes 5,6,7,8.

Since 4 snare hits in that beat are implied, and total notes per beat are only 4, the best way is to place a snare hit on each note of beat 2.

### Implementation:

- For beat 2 (notes 5-8), insert snare hits at each position: **X** (hard) or **x** (soft).
- To keep it consistent and impactful, let's choose **X** for all.

---

### Final Notation:
- Place X in the second beat (notes 5 to 8).
- Keep other elements as they are (no other changes needed).

### Final groove:

K: OOO- | ---- | OOO- | OOO
S: ---- | XXXXX | ---- | O---
H: ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
T: ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
C: O--- | O--- | O--- | O---
R: ---- | ---- | ---- | ----

This ensures snare hits on every 16th note in beat 2, satisfying the editing request.
