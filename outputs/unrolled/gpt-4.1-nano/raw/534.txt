The instructions are to remove all cymbal (C, R) and kick (K) lines.

- Remove the C line: `O---|O---|O---|O---` (already silent, can be omitted)
- Remove the K line: `OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO`

Remaining instruments:
- S (snare): `----|O---|----|O---`
- H (hihat): `----|----|----|----` (silent)
- T (toms): `----|----|----|----` (silent)

Since the only active instruments are snare and, previously, the hi-hat and kick, now silence. To keep some rhythm, I will keep only the snare pattern.

**Final groove:**

S: ----|O---|----|O---

This matches the request: no cymbals or kick, only the snare pattern.
