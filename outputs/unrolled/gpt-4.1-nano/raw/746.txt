**Thought process:**

- The original groove has:
  - No snare (S) in the first beat (`----`)
  - No cymbal (C) in the first beat (`O---`)
- To fulfill the request:
  - Add a snare hit in the first beat of S: change `----` to `O---`.
  - Add a cymbal hit in the first beat of C: change `O---` to `O---` (already present, so no change needed).
- Since the cymbal is already played in the first beat, only the snare needs to be added.

**Final adjustments:**

- S first beat: `O---`
- C remains `O---`

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: O---|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**
- The first beat now includes both a snare and a cymbal, as requested.
