Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** O---|---o|O-O-|----
  - 4 notes: O (beat 1), o (beat 2.4), O (beat 3.1)
  - Total: 3 hits so far

- **Snare (S):** ----|O---|----|O---
  - 2 hits (beats 2.1 and 4.4)

- **Hi-hat (H):** --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
  - Hi-hat hits on most sixteenths, total many notes

- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----
  - none

- **Crash (C):** O---|----|----|----
  - 1 hit

- **Ride (R):** ----|----|----|----
  - none

To satisfy the "no more than 8 notes," I need to drastically reduce the number of total hits, especially in hi-hat and other instruments.

### Strategy:
- Keep main kick and snare hits to preserve basic rhythm
- Remove hi-hat or minimal hi-hat activity
- Eliminate toms and ride to reduce overall notes
- Possibly keep crash cymbal to add emphasis

**Total notes I aim for:** 8 or fewer, 1-2 per instrument.

### Proposed plan:
- Kick: only one hit, perhaps on beat 1.
- Snare: on beat 3.
- Hi-hat: only on beat 1 for simplicity.
- Crash cymbal: on beat 1 for emphasis.
- Total: 1 (kick) + 1 (snare) + 1 (hi-hat) + 1 (crash) = 4 notes, well within the limit.

### Final pattern:

K: O---|----|----|----
S: ----|----|--O-|----
H: x---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Notes:**
- Kick on beat 1
- Snare on beat 3
- Closed hi-hat on beat 1
- Crash cymbal at start (beat 1 before anything else)

This is a very simplified pattern, fulfilling the note limit and providing a basic rhythmic foundation.
