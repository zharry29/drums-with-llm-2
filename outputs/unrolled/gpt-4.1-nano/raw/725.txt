**Thought process:**

- The original groove has a hi-hat pattern `----|x---|----|x---`, with hits on the second and last beats but no initial hit.
- The request specifies adding a hi-hat hit and a cymbal in the very beginning.
- For the hi-hat, I will add a soft closed hit (`x---`) on the first beat.
- For the cymbal, which is not present in the original, I will add a crash cymbal hit, `O---`, at the very start of the groove, or the first beat of the C line.

**Implementation plan:**

- Change the first beat of the hi-hat (H) from `----` to `x---`.
- Change the first beat of the cymbal (C) from `----` to `O---`.

**Final groove:**

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: x---|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This now has a hi-hat hit `x---` and a cymbal `O---` at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
