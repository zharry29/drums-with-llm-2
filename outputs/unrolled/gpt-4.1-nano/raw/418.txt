Let's analyze the initial groove:

- Kick (K): plays in the first, third, and last beats with various soft and hard hits.
- Snare (S): plays on the second and fourth beats.
- Hi-hat (H): silent.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C and R): C plays on all beats with some hits, R is silent.

**The instruction:** remove all hi-hat (H) and kick (K).

### Plan:
- Remove lines K and H.
- Keep snare (S), cymbal C, ride R, and any others relevant.
- Since C (cymbal) plays on every beat in the current groove, and R is silent, after removal, only snare and cymbal C remain.

### Result:
- Remove lines K and H.
- Keep S and C as they are.
- T and R are to be removed since R is silent and C is a cymbal.

### Final pattern after removal:

@@@
S: ----|O---|----|O---
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
T: (removed)
K: (removed)
H: (removed)
R: (removed)

### Final groove:

```
@@@
S: ----|O---|----|O---
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
T: (removed)
K: (removed)
H: (removed)
R: (removed)
@@@
```

This creates a rhythmic pattern emphasizing the snare with a steady cymbal pattern, suitable after removing hi-hat and kick.
