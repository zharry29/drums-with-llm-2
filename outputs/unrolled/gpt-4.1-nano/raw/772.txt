**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O---|----|O---|----` (kick on first and third beats)
  - Snare (S): `----|O---|----|O---` (snare on beats 2 and 4)
  - Hi-hat (H): `X---|X---|X---|X---` (let's assume all on eighth notes for consistency)
  - Toms (T): `----|----|----|----` (none)
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): silent

- Request:
  - Add a snare hit and a tom in the very beginning (first beat).

- The first beat:
  - Kicking: `O---` (already present)
  - Snare: currently `----`, needs to be changed to a hit, e.g., `X---` (hard snare)
  - Toms: currently `----`, need to add a tom hit, e.g., `O---`

**Final plan:**

- Snare in first beat: `X---`
- Tom in first beat: `O---`
- Keep the original kick pattern.

This version includes a snare hit (`X`) and a tom (`O`) in the very beginning, matching the requested change.
