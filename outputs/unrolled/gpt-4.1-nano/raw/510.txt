The request is to remove all cymbals (C and R) and toms (T).  
- The T line: `----|----|----|----` — remove it.  
- The C line: `----|----|----|----` — remove it.  
- The R line: `----|----|----|----` — remove it.

Remaining instruments:
- K (kick): `O--O|----|--O-|----` (keep the pattern)
- S (snare): `----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o` (keep the pattern)
- H (hi-hat): `X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-` (keep the pattern)

Since the hi-hat is active, I will leave it as is. The kick and snare are also active. I will just present the cleaned-up groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

This version removes all cymbals and toms, while maintaining a consistent groove with kick, snare, and hi-hat.
