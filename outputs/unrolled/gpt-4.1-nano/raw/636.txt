To fulfill the request:

- The current kick pattern (K) is `OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO`, with multiple hits, including at the beginning. The request is for a clear kick hit and a ride cymbal at the very start, implying a more emphasized and possibly simplified initial count.

- The current ride (R) pattern has no hits; we need to add a ride hit at the beginning.

**Steps:**
1. Make the first beat of the kick (K) pattern a single, clear hit: change the first part (`OOO-`) to just `O---` so that there's a single, prominent kick at the start.
2. Add a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning: change the first beat of R from `----` to `O---`.

**Proposed pattern:**
- K: `O---|--O-|OOO-|-OOO` (modified first beat)
- R: `O---|----|----|----`

Here's the final version:

K: O---|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|----|----|----

This places a clear kick and ride cymbal hit at the very start, aligned with the request.
