Let's analyze the current groove and the timing for the cymbal hit:

- The second beat spans notes 5-8.
- The "a" of "1 e & a" of beat 2 corresponds to the 8th note in that beat.
- Counting all 16 notes in the bar:
  - Beat 1: notes 1-4
  - Beat 2: notes 5-8
  - Beat 3: notes 9-12
  - Beat 4: notes 13-16
- The "a" of beat 2 is note 8, the last subdivision of beat 2.

In the notation:
- The first beat is characters 1-4.
- The second beat characters 6-9.

Since the second beat's notes 5-8 are characters 6-9, note 8 is the **last character** in the second group (notes 5-8).

Looking at the cymbal line (`R`):
`x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-`

- The second group is `X-x-`
- The last character of that group (note 8), is the 4th character of `X-x-`, which is `-`.

We need to change this last character in the second group's pattern from `-` to `O` to place the cymbal hit on the 'a' of beat 2.

### Final step:
- Change the last `-` in the `R` line's second group to `O`.

### Final groove:

**Only modification:** In the last character of the second group of `R`, changing from `-` to `O`.
