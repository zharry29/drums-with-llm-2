Let's analyze the original groove to identify the cymbal hits on beat 4:

- The last beat (middle section) has:
  - K: ---- (no hit)
  - S: O--- (hit at note 13)
  - H: O-o- (hits at notes 9, 11, 13, 15)
  - T: ----
  - C: ---- (no hit played here on beat 4)
  - R: ----

From the notation, the cymbal is in line C, with O at the start of each beat and no hits in beat 4, so there are no cymbal hits on beat 4 to remove. Actually, note that in this groove, the C line has O--- at the start of each beat, but in the last segment of beat 4, all are -.

Therefore, there is **no cymbal hit on beat 4** in the provided groove, but to fulfill the request, we should ensure that **there are no cymbal hits in beat 4**.

Since the C line has no hits in beat 4, the current groove is already compliant. However, to be thorough, if there were any cymbal hits on beat 4, we would remove them.

**Final step:** Confirm that no cymbal hits are on beat 4, leaving the same as in the original.

### Final groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This maintains the same pattern, already free of cymbal hits on beat 4. If you want, I can remove any existing ones explicitly, but itâ€™s not necessary here.
