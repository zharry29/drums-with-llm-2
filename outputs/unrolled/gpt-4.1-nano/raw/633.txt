To fulfill the request:

- Add a kick hit at the very beginning: change K from `O---` to `O---` (it's already a hit on the first note).
- Add a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning: change R from `----` to `O---` to emphasize the ride hit.

**Approach:**
- The kick (K) is already hitting at the first 16th note, so no change needed there.
- The ride (R) pattern should be changed from `----` to `O---` to add the cymbal at the start.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

Now, both a kick and a ride cymbal hit are at the very beginning, as requested.
