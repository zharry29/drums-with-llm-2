Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays on beats 1, 2, and 4, with varying intensity.
- Snare (S): plays on beat 3.
- Hi-hat (H): no hits.
- Toms (T): plays on every beat with alternating soft and hard hits.
- Cymbals (C) and Ride (R): no hits.

**Request:** no cymbal or hi-hat.

**Approach:**

- Remove the H and C lines.
- Keep the kick, snare, and Toms.
- Toms are present with soft/hard hits on each beat; they add percussive interest.

### Final plan:

- Keep K, S, and T.
- Remove C and H.

This creates a rhythm with kick, snare, and Toms, with no cymbal or hi-hat as requested.
