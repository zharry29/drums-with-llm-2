Let's analyze what we have:

- No initial kick or snare, only hi-hat and cymbals.
- Hi-hat ("x---") on measure 2 beat 1 and measure 4 beat 1.
- Cymbals ("x---" and "X-x-") on the first 3 beats, providing some splash sounds.
- The rest is silence.

---

**Goals for the edit:**
- Incorporate **kick** and **snare** to give the groove more drive.
- Make the hi-hat pattern more consistent or rhythmic.
- Add some tom hits for variation.

---

### Approach:
1. Add a **kick** on beat 1, measure 1 ("O---").
2. Add a **snare** on beat 3, measure 2 ("----|--O-|-").
3. Add **tom** hits in measure 3, perhaps beat 2 or 4 for flavor.
4. Keep the hi-hat active on all beats with steady "x---".

---

### Final plan:
- Measure 1, beat 1: kick ("O---")
- Measure 2, beat 3: snare ("--O-")
- Measure 3: add a tom on beat 4 ("---O")
- Hi-hat: consistent, "x---" on all beats

---

### Final groove:

K: O---|----|----|----
S: ----|--O-|----|----
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|O---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

```

**Note:**  
- Kick on measure 1 beat 1 ("O---").  
- Snare on measure 2 beat 3 ("--O-").  
- Tom in measure 4 beat 4 ("---O").  
- Hi-hat steady on all beats.  
- Cymbals and ride remain silent for clarity, but could be added for fullness if desired.

This creates a more dynamic, rhythmically interesting pattern while fulfilling the request to include both hi-hat and toms.
