**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `----` to `O---` (hard kick).
- To add a snare hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of S from `----` to `--O-` (hard snare on the third 16th note of the beat).

**Implementation:**

- K: from `----` to `O---`
- S: from `----` to `--O-`

---

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|----|----
S: --O-|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**Summary:** The first beat now contains both a kick and a snare, as requested.
