Let's analyze the initial groove:

- Kick (K): plays at the first, third, and last beats with soft and hard hits.
- Snare (S): plays on all beats with varied articulations including open hits.
- Hi-hat (H): plays with x-x- pattern on every eighth note, providing continuous closed hi-hat rhythm.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C and R): silent.

**The instruction: remove all hi-hat and kick.**

Therefore, lines K and H should be removed.

Remaining patterns:

S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

Now, only snare remains. Given that the snare has some interesting articulations, I think it's worthwhile to keep some of those patterns to keep the groove rhythmically interesting.

**Final plan:**

- Keep the snare pattern as is.
- Keep silence for Toms and Cymbals.

S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
K: (removed)
H: (removed)

This provides a rhythmic emphasis on the snare, with the rest silent, fitting the request to remove hi-hat and kick.
