**Thought process:**

- To add a snare hit at the very beginning, modify the first beat of S from `----` to `S---`.
- To add a cymbal at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---` (already a cymbal hit, so no change needed).

**Steps:**

- Replace the first beat of S with `S---`.
- Keep C's first beat as `O---` to maintain the cymbal.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: S---|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds a snare hit and keeps the cymbal in place at the very beginning, as requested.
