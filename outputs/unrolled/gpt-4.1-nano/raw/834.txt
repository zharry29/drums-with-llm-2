**Thought process:**

- Existing groove:
  - Kick (K): `O---|----|O---|----`
  - Snare (S): `----|O---|----|O---`
  - Hi-hat (H): `X---|X---|X---|X---`
  - Toms (T): all rests
  - Crash (C): all rests
  - Ride (R): all rests

- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and a kick in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Change the first beat of K from `O---` to `O---` (already a kick at start)
  - Add a tom hit (`O`) in the first beat of T
  - Since T is all rests, replace the first part with `O---` for a tom hit at the very start

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: O---|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**This includes a tom hit and a kick at the very beginning, fulfilling your request.**
