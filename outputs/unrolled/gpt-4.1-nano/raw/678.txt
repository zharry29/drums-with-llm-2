**Thought process:**

- To add a cymbal hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---` (a crash cymbal).
- To add a tom at the very beginning, change the first beat of T from `----` to `O---` (a tom hit).
- These two sounds should occur simultaneously at the first beat.

**Implementation:**

- T: from `----` to `O---`
- C: from `----` to `O---`

---

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

Now the first beat features both a cymbal hit and a tom, fulfilling the request.
