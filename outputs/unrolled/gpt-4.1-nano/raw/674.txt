**Thought process:**

- To add a ride hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of R from `x---` to `O---` (ride cymbal on the bell).
- To add a kick, change the first beat of K from `----` to `O---` for a hard kick.
- Both should appear at the very first beat.

**Implementation:**

- K: from `----` to `O---`
- R: from `x---` to `O---`

---

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This includes a kick and a ride hit at the very beginning, as requested.
