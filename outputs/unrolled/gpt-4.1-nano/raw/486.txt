The request is to remove all ride cymbal (R) and hi-hat (H) parts. So, I will delete those lines entirely. The remaining instruments are kick (K), snare (S), toms (T), and crash cymbal (C).

Original:
- K: plays on beats 1, 2, and 3 with various articulations.
- S: plays on beats 2 and 4.
- H: plays on every beat with soft and hard open hits.
- T: silent.
- C: plays on beat 1.
- R: plays on no notes here, so can be ignored.

Since H and R are to be removed, I will keep only K, S, T, and C. T and R are silent in this groove. To create a rhythmical pattern, I'll keep:
- The Kick drum at the start and at beat 2 (soft hit O at beat 2 in measure 2).
- The snare at beats 2 and 4.
- The crash cymbal on beat 1 for impact (already present).
- Toms are silent here, but I can add some for interest if desired.

### Final plan:
- Remove H and R lines.
- Keep K, S, and C.
- Possibly add toms (T) if necessary for variation.

### Revised groove:
```plaintext
K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: (removed)
```

I will keep the initial crash (C) on beat 1, snare on beat 2 and 4, and kick at the start and in measure 2.

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: (removed)

This keeps a simple, effective rhythm emphasizing the kick, snare, and crash cymbal, with no hi-hat or ride.
