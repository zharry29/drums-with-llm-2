Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays prominent hits with "OOO-" and some occasional soft hits.
- **Snare (S):** on beats 2 and 4 in measures 2 and 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** hits at every beat (consistent open crash).
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add a ride cymbal pattern to support the groove and complement the crash cymbal.

### Approach:
- Insert ride hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4, common placements.
- Keep the overall structure intact, matching the energy of the existing kick and crash.
- To balance the texture, add ride hits without removing the crash or overloading.

### Final plan:
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the existing kick, snare, and crash pattern.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**  
- Added ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4 in the ride line.
- Maintained the existing groove with emphasis on the kick and crash for energy.
- This creates a balanced, fuller rhythmic support combining crash and ride cymbals along with the core pattern.
