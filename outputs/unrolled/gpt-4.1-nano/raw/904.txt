Let's review the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** ----|----|----|----
  - No kicks
- **Snare (S):** ----|----|----|----
  - No snare hits
- **Hi-hat (H):** ----|x---|----|x---
  - Hi-hat hits on second beat (notes 5) and fourth beat (notes 13)?
  - Actually, only on notes 6 and 14 (since x at position 6 and 14).
- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----
  - No tom hits
- **Cymbal (C):** ----|----|----|----
  - No cymbal hits
- **Ride (R):** x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
  - Multiple hits on each beat, including X-x pattern.

---

### Edit goal:
- **Snare on every 16th note in the second beat.**

The second beat is **----|----** (notes 5-8). In the current notation, no snare hits there.

Since the beat has four notes (positions 5,6,7,8), to place a snare on each note, I will:

- Replace the snare line, adding **O** (hard snare) on notes 5,6,7,8.

---

### Implementation:
- Keep the snare line as all **O** in beat two:
- In the original, the snare line is all **-**, so we'll update it to **O** for each of the notes in beat 2.

### Final edited groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|OOOO|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**Explanation:**
- Snare (S): now has **O** for notes 5-8, meaning snare hits on every 16th note in beat 2.
- Other instruments unchanged.

This meets the requirement of snare on every 16th note in the second beat.
