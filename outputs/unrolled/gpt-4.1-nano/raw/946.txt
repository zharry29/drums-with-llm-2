Let's analyze the current groove:

- K (Kick): `O---|---o|O-O-|----`  
  - Beat 1: `O---` (kick at the first 16th note)  
  - Beat 2: `---o` (kick at the 4th 16th note)  
  - Beat 3: `O-O-` (kick at 1st and 3rd 16th note)  
  - Beat 4: `----` (no kick)

The instruction is **no kick on beat 4**.  
Currently, beat 4 has `----`, so no change is needed.

**Final version:**

K: O---|---o|O-O|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The groove already satisfies the request.
