Let's analyze the current groove:

- Toms are: `O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`
- They are played consistently in all four beats, with alternating hard and soft hits, but the pattern is quite static.

### Goal:
- Keep the same placement of Toms.
- Make the Toms pattern **more dynamic**â€”more variation, accents, and movement to enhance energy and interest.

### Approach:
- Increase dynamics by:
  - Adding accents (harder hits `O`) at certain moments.
  - Varying the softness (`o`) to create contrast.
  - Including some off-beat or accented hits for variation.

### Implementation:
- Keep the pattern of Toms on all beats.
- On beat 1, emphasize with `O`.
- On beat 2, alternate with `O` and `o` to create groove.
- On beat 3 and 4, add some accents (X or `O`) for more punch.

### Final pattern:
- First beat: `O` (emphasized)
- Second beat: `O-o-` with an accented `O` on the downbeat, softer `o` on the off.
- Third beat: same as second, possibly with an additional accent on the off.
- Fourth beat: similar, with an additional accent or variation.

**Example:**
`O---|O-o-|X-o-|X-o-`

### Final groove:

This pattern maintains the placement but adds dynamics via varied hits and accents to sound more lively and expressive.
