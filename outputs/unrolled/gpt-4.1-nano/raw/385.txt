Let's identify the current hits:

- Kick 'K': plays on beat 1 with a hard hit 'O' and on beat 2 with a soft hit 'o'.
- Snare 'S': plays on beat 2 and 4 with hard 'O' hits.
- Hi-hat 'H': plays on every beat with alternating soft and hard hits.
- Toms 'T': none.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': none.

**Request:** Remove all kick ('K') and toms ('T').

- We'll replace the 'K' line with all dashes ('-') as there are hits in both beats 1 and 2.
- Keep 'T' line as all dashes as it has no hits.

**Final step:** Keep the rest of the pattern as is to preserve the groove.

### Final edited groove:

This version removes all kick and tom hits, fulfilling the request while maintaining the rhythm with snare, hi-hat, cymbals, and the pattern's feel.
