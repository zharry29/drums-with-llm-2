To add a tom hit and cymbal at the very beginning, I will modify the first beat (the first 4 characters) in each line:

Original first beat:
- K: O---
- S: ----
- H: --o-
- T: ----
- C: O---
- R: ----

Since the goal is to add a tom hit and cymbal:
- For the tom: T: O---
- For the cymbal: C: O---

The cymbal is already in the first beat ('O---'), so no change needed there. To meet the request, I will add the tom hit:

- T: O---

**Final plan:**
- Keep K: O---
- Keep S: ----
- Keep H: --o-
- Change T: to O---
- Keep C: O---
- Keep R: ----

Final edited drum groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This meets the request by adding a tom hit at the start, along with confirming the cymbal presence.
