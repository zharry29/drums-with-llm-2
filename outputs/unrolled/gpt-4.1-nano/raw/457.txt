Let's review the original groove:

- Kick (K): soft hits on beats 1 and 3 at specific 16th notes.
- Snare (S): hits on beats 2 and 3 with sidestick (X).
- Hi-hat (H): closed hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Toms (T): no hits.
- Cymbals (C): no hits.
- Ride (R): hits with mixed closed and open strikes, clearly intended as cymbal or ride.

**Given the request:** No cymbal or hi-hat.

**Steps:**

- Remove C (cymbal) and H (hi-hat) lines completely.
- Keep K, S, T, R as they are, recognizing that R is ride cymbal and should be removed since the request is no cymbal or hi-hat.

**Final plan:**

- Remove C and H.
- Keep K and S.
- T is empty.
- R is also empty now since it's a cymbal, unless we interpret R as a ride cymbal â€“ but the instructions say no cymbal or hihat, so remove R as well.

### Final groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
T: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
C: (removed)

This keeps a rhythmic pattern with kick and snare, no cymbals or hi-hat, as requested.
