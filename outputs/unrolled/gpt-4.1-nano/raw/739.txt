**Thought process:**

- The original groove has no cymbal (C) or snare (S) hits at the start.
- The request is to add both a cymbal hit and a snare in the very beginning.
- For the snare (S), modify the first beat from `----` to `O---`.
- For the cymbal (C), modify the first beat from `O---` to `O---` (already a cymbal hit). Good, so no change needed here: it's already a cymbal hit in the first beat.
- The other parts (K, H, T, R) can remain unchanged unless the pattern calls for it.

**Final decision:**

- Change S first beat to `O---`.
- Leave C as `O---` for the first beat (already a cymbal hit).

**Final groove:**

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: O---|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**

- The first beat now has a snare hit (`O---`) and a cymbal hit (`O---`), fulfilling the request.
