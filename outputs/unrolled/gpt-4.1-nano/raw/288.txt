Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3 ("O---" in measures 1 and 3).
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 ("O---" in measures 2 and 4).
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent pattern with X on all beats ("X---" repeatedly).
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add a ride cymbal pattern to complement the hi-hat, creating a fuller sound and more rhythmic variety.

### Approach:
- Introduce ride hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4, a common placement.
- Keep the hi-hat steady for texture.
- Keep the kick and snare for rhythm foundation.

### Implementation:
- Add ride hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the existing groove otherwise intact.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**  
- **Ride cymbal ("O---")** added on beats 2 and 4 in the ride line.
- Maintains the consistent hi-hat pattern.
- Keeps the bass and snare for solid rhythm; the addition of the ride gives more harmonic support and rhythmic interest.
