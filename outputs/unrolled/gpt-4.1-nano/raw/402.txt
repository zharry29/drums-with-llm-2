Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays with soft hits ('o') on certain beats.
- Snare (S): plays on the second and third beats, with sidestick hits.
- Hi-hat (H): plays on the second and fourth beats with soft closed hits ('x').
- Toms (T): all silent.
- Crash (C): silent.
- Ride (R): plays with a pattern of open and closed hits on every beat.

Since the request is to remove **all snare (S)** and **toms (T)**, we'll delete these lines entirely.

Remaining instruments:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
H: ----|x---|----|x---  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Next, to keep the groove interesting, I'll:

- Keep the kick pattern as is, giving rhythmic foundation.
- Retain the ride pattern for texture.
- Add a simple consistent closed hi-hat pattern to maintain a steady pulse.
- Keep the crash cymbal silent for a cleaner sound, but could consider adding it for emphasis depending on style later.

For clarity:

- Keep the kick pattern as in original.
- Use a closed hi-hat player on every 8th note (the second and fourth notes in each beat).
- Keep the ride pattern intact.

Final plan:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-  (consistent closed hi-hat on every 8th note)
C: ----|----|----|---- (no crash for now)
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This creates a lively yet simple groove, with steady rhythm and syncopation.

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-

This pattern keeps the energy without snare or toms, matching the specifications.
