To add a tom hit and a snare at the very beginning, I will focus on the first beat (first 4 characters of each line).

Currently, the first beat is:
- K: O--O
- S: ----
- H: X-x-
- T: ----
- C: ----
- R: ----

I will:
- Add a snare hit: for example, S: O---
- Add a tom hit: for example, T: O---

Since I need to add these per your instruction, I will replace or modify the first beat to include both a snare and a tom hit. 

Choosing:
- S: O---
- T: O---

Replace the first beat in those lines accordingly.

The rest of the groove should stay the same.

Final result:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: O---|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: O---|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds a snare and a tom hit at the very beginning, aligning with your request, while keeping the existing rhythm pattern.
