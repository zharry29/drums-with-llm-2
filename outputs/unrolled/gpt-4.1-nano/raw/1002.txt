Let's plan the modifications carefully:

### Given instructions:
- Play **closed hi-hat (`x` or `X`)** on **all 8th notes** (which are the notes at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16).
- **Open hi-hat (`O`)** on **every up beat** (the off-beats after each downbeat: at notes 2, 6, 10, 14).
- Keep the hits **hard** (`X` for closed, `O` for open).

### Step-by-step reasoning:

- The **downbeats** are notes 1, 5, 9, 13.
- The **up beats** are notes 2, 6, 10, 14.
  
For every **8th note**, we will:
- Play **closed hi-hat (`X`)** at all 8th notes.
- On the **up beats** (2, 6, 10, 14), instead of closed, **play open** (`O`), as per the instructions.
- The remaining 8th notes (4, 8, 12, 16) that aren't up beats will be closed (`X`).

### Pattern:
- Notes 2, 6, 10, 14: open `O`
- Notes 4, 8, 12, 16: closed `X`

### Constructed hi-hat line:
`-X--|-O--|-X--|-O--`

Now, translating to the notation:

### Final drum groove:
```plaintext

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: -X--|-O--|-X--|-O--
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

This pattern ensures the hi-hat is **played loudly** and **on every 8th note**, with **open hi-hat on every off-beat**, as requested.
