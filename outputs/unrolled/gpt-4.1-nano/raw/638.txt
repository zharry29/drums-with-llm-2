**Thought process:**

1. The current kick pattern (K) is `O--O|----|--O-|----`. For the beginning, there's already a kick on the first 16th note (`O--O`), so that’s fine — it has a hit at the start.
2. The ride cymbal (R) pattern, which is `o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-`, does not have a hit at the very beginning. To satisfy the request, I will change the first beat of R from `o-O-` to `O---`.

**Implementation:**

- Change R: `o-O-` → `O---` for the first beat.
- Keep the rest of the patterns as-is to preserve the groove.

**Final edited groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

Now, there is a kick and a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
