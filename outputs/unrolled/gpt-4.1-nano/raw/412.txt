Let's analyze the original drum groove:

- Kick (K): hits on the first and third beats with soft hits.
- Snare (S): plays on the second beat ("Oo-o") and last beat ("O--o").
- Hi-hat (H): silent.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Crash (C): silent.
- Ride (R): plays on every eighth note with alternating soft and hard hits ("o-O-").

**The request is to remove all hi-hat and cymbal sounds.**

This means we eliminate lines H, C, and R.

Remaining pattern:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----  
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o  
T: ----|----|----|----  
H: (removed)  
C: (removed)  
R: (removed)  

The resulting groove is now simple and rhythmically interesting with kick and snare only. The ride pattern has been removed as well, as per request.

**Final edited groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
T: ----|----|----|----
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This provides a clear, straightforward drum pattern without hi-hat or cymbals, matching the request.
