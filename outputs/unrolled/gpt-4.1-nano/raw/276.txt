Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 ("O---" in beats 1 and 4, "O---" in beat 2).
- **Snare (S):** none.
- **Hi-Hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** alternate hits with "O-o-" on all beats, adding rhythmic interest.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### Objective:
- Add a ride cymbal pattern.
- Keep the existing kick pattern.

### Approach:
- Reinforce the kick to be more prominent or more rhythmic.
- Incorporate ride cymbal hits, typically on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the groove balanced with the existing elements.

### Implementation:
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep existing kick pattern on beats 1, 2, and 4.
- Keep the Toms and other parts as they are, or slightly adjust if needed.

**Explanation:**
- Added ride cymbal ("O---") on beats 2 and 4 for the ride pattern.
- Keep the kick and other parts the same.
- Creates a more complete groove with both kick and ride.
