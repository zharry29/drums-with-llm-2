Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): soft hits on beat 1 and beat 3, with patterns o--- and o---.
- Snare (S): hits on beat 2 with sidesticks (X) and beat 3 with sidesticks (X).
- Hi-hat (H): plays soft open hits at beat 2 and 4 (x---, x---).
- Toms (T): no hits.
- Cymbals (C): no hits.
- Ride (R): pattern with open and closed hits (X-x, X-x, etc.).

**Request:** No kick or ride.  

So, remove the K and R lines. Focus on what's left:

- Snare: continues on beat 2 and 3 with sidestick hits.
- Hi-hat: plays consistent soft open hits.
- Cymbals and Toms are silent.

### Final plan:

- Keep snare hits on beats 2 and 3.
- Keep steady hi-hat pattern.
- Remove the kick and ride.

### Updated groove:

This simplifies the groove while maintaining rhythmic interest with snare hits on beats 2 and 3 paired with steady hi-hat hits.
