Let's break down the task:

**Current groove:**

- Hi-hat line: `----|----|----|----` â€” no hi-hat played.
- The instruction: **Play closed hi-hat (`X`) on all 8th notes (positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16).**
- **Open hi-hat (`O`) on every up beat** (the off-beats following downbeats), i.e., at notes 2, 6, 10, 14.
- **Keep hits hard (`X` for soft, `O` for open):** Use `X` for closed hits and `O` for open hits, both with emphasis.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The 8th notes are at positions: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16.
- On each **up beat** (the off-beats): 2, 6, 10, 14 -> open `O`.
- On the other 8th notes: closed `X`.

**Here's the plan:**

- At 2: open (`O`) (up beat)
- At 4: closed (`X`)
- At 6: open (`O`)
- At 8: closed (`X`)
- At 10: open (`O`)
- At 12: closed (`X`)
- At 14: open (`O`)
- At 16: closed (`X`)

Now, translate this into the notation: `-X--|-O--|-X--|-O--`

---

### Final groove:

```plaintext

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: -X--|-O--|-X--|-O--
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

```

This pattern keeps the hi-hat hits **hard**, with **closed hits on all 8th notes** and **open on every up beat**.
