Let's examine the current groove:

- K (Kick): `O---|----|O---|----`

The kicks happen:
- Beat 1: first 4 notes `O---`
- Beat 3: third 4 notes `O---`
- Beat 4: last 4 notes `----` (no kick)

The instruction is "no kick on beat 4," but currently, the groove already has no kick in beat 4, so no change is needed.

**Final answer:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The groove remains the same, as it already meets the requirement.
