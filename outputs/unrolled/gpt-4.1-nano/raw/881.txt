Let's analyze the current groove and plan the edit.

**Current groove:**
- K (Kick): OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
- S (Snare): ----|O---|----|O---
- H (Hi-hat): ----|----|----|----
- T (Toms): ----|----|----|----
- C (Crash): O---|O---|O---|O---
- R (Ride): ----|----|----|----

**Key points:**
- The snare hits are on measure 2, beat 1 and measure 4, beat 1, which are downbeats of measures 2 and 4.
- The instruction is to avoid snare on *the downbeat of 2 and 4*, meaning the first 16th note of those measures.

**Current hits:**
- Measure 2: snare on beat 1 (first character): "O---" → this is a downbeat.
- Measure 4: snare on beat 1 ("O---") → this is also a downbeat.

**Approach:**
- Remove or move the snare hits on measure 2 and 4 beat 1.
- To maintain a full rhythmic pattern, replace those with rests or offbeat hits.

**Plan:**
- Change measure 2: "O---" to "---"
- Change measure 4: "O---" to "---"

**Result:**
- No snare on downbeats of measures 2 and 4.
- Keep the other snare hits intact (measure 2, beat 4 and measure 4, beat 4).

This version ensures that the snare is *not* on the downbeat of measure 2 and 4, satisfying the instruction while maintaining rhythmic consistency.
