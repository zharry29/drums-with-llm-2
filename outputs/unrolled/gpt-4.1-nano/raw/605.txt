To fulfill the request of adding a tom hit and cymbal in the very beginning, I will focus on the first beat (the first 4 characters of each line).

Original first beat:
- K: O---
- S: ----
- H: X---
- T: ----
- C: ----
- R: ----

Specifically:
- The existing cymbal is in the C line, but it's currently empty (- in the first beat), so I will add a cymbal hit.
- For the tom hit, T: ----, I will add a tom hit in the first beat as O---

**Key points:**
- For the cymbal: let's add a crash in the first beat! I'll set C: O---
- For the tom: add a hit at the same position: T: O---

Here's the edited version:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds a tom hit and cymbal crash at the very beginning while keeping other parts unchanged.
