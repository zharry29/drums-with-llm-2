Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 ("O--O"), 3 ("--O-")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 ("Oo-o", "-o--", "O--o")
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays on every beat with consistent closed hits ("X-x-")
- **Toms, cymbals (C, R):** silent

**New requirements:**
- **Remove snare and ride cymbal** (no S or R lines).
- Keep the kick drum and hi-hat pattern but can modify to fit a cleaner groove without snare or ride.

### Approach:
- Keep the kick pattern largely the same but possibly simplify for clarity.
- Keep hi-hat hits to maintain a steady rhythmic pulse.
- Remove snare and cymbal lines altogether.

### Final plan:
- Retain kicks on beats 1 and 3.
- Keep hi-hat pattern consistent.
- Remove snare and ride altogether, simplifying the groove.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

This creates a straightforward, clean pattern emphasizing kick and hi-hat, with no snare or ride cymbal, per your instructions.
