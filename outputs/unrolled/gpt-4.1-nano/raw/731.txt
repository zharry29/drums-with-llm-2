**Thought process:**

- The original groove has no snare or hi-hat hits at the start.
- The request is to add a snare hit **and** a hi-hat hit in the very beginning.
- For the hi-hat, I will add a closed hit (`x---`) at the start.
- For the snare, I will add a hard snare (`O---`) at the start.
- The current snare (S) line is `----|----|O---|----` – I will change the first beat (`----`) to `O---`.
- The hi-hat (H) line is `----|----|----|----` – I will change the first beat from `----` to `x---`.

---

**Final updates:**

- Snare (S): `O---` in first beat
- Hi-hat (H): `x---` in first beat

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: O---|----|O---|----
H: x---|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This configuration adds both a snare and hi-hat hit at the very beginning, as requested.
