Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays on the first and third beats with soft hits.
- Snare (S): plays on all four beats, with various open/closed and soft/hard hits.
- Hi-hat (H): silent.
- Toms (T): silent.
- C (Crash) and R (Ride): plays on all beats with accents and open/closed hits.

**The request: no hi-hat or kick, which means removing lines K and H completely.**

Remaining patterns:
- Snare (S): as is.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C and R): removed.

**Final step:**

- Keep only the snare pattern.
- Remove hi-hat and cymbal lines entirely.

**Resulting groove:**

S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
T: ----|----|----|----
C: (removed)
R: (removed)
K: (removed)
H: (removed)

This creates a groove with just the snare, emphasizing the backbeat, with no hi-hat or kick.
