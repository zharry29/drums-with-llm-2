Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick: hits at certain points, with some soft hits.
- Snare: plays on beats 2 and 4 with some ghost notes (`o`), adding texture.
- Hi-hat: plays steady with X and x, alternating between closed and soft closed sounds, providing rhythmic fill.
- Toms, cymbals, and ride are silent.

### Objective:
Increase the presence of **more low-frequency sounds** — mainly through the bass drum and toms, and perhaps a heavier emphasis on the kick.

### Approach:
- Make the kick hits more frequent, especially on downbeats and off-beats.
- Add or emphasize tom hits for depth and low frequencies.
- Minimize or eliminate higher-frequency sounds like the hi-hat to focus on the low end.

### Implementation:
- Replace or add mid and low tom hits on the second half of the bar to create a more "low-sounding" feel.
- Keep the kick pattern similar but make it more prominent.

### Explanation:
- The kick hits on every beat, emphasizing the low frequency foundation.
- Toms are now playing on beats 2 and 4 with soft and loud hits for additional depth.
- Snare and cymbals are silent, making the low frequencies more prominent.
- This creates a more bass-heavy, grounded groove with abundant low sounds.
