Let's analyze the current groove:

- The second beat is **---o|O-o-**, which are notes 5-8.

The goal is to have **snare hits on every 16th note within the second beat**, meaning notes 5, 6, 7, and 8 should all feature snare hits.

In the current groove, snare hits are only on note 6 (O). To meet the requirement, I will:

- Add snare hits (O) on notes 5, 7, and 8 as well.

---

### Implementation steps:
- For the second beat (notes 5-8), change the snare line from **---|O--|--|--** to **O--|O--|O--|O--** for the 4 notes (notes 5-8).

### Final groove:

S: O---|O---|O---|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Now, the snare hits occur on every 16th note in the second beat, fulfilling the request.
