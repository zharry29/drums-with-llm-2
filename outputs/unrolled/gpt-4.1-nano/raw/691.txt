**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `OOO-` to `O- O-` or similar for a single hit; but since the original starts with three hits (`OOO-`), I'll change just the first beat to a single hit `O---` to emphasize the beginning.
- To add a snare in the very first beat, change the first beat of S from `----` to `--O-` (a snare hit on the third note).
- The first beat of K currently has `OOO-`, so I will change it to `O---` to have a clear kick on the first note.

**Implementation:**

- K: from `OOO-` to `O---`
- S: from `----` to `--O-`

**Final groove:**

K: O---|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: --O-|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**Result:** First beat has a clear kick and snare, fulfilling the request.
