Let's analyze and plan for the hi-hat part:

**Current hi-hat pattern:**
`X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-`  
- It currently plays alternating open and closed hits, with "X" and "x" indicating hard and soft closed hits, and "X" indicating open hits in some parts.

**New instructions:**
- Play **closed hi-hat (`X`)** on all 8th notes (positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16).
- Open on **every up beat** (i.e., notes 2, 6, 10, 14).
- Keep hits **hard** (use `X` for closed, `O` for open).

### Step-by-step:
- For each beat, at the 8th notes, replace with `X` for closed hits.
- On up beats (2, 6, 10, 14), change to open `O`.

### Pattern:
- 2: open `O`
- 4: closed `X`
- 6: open `O`
- 8: closed `X`
- 10: open `O`
- 12: closed `X`
- 14: open `O`
- 16: closed `X`

### Final hi-hat pattern:
`-X--|-O--|-X--|-O--`

### Final drum groove:

```

This configuration ensures:
- **All 8th notes** are played with **hard closed hits**.
- **Open hits** are on **every up beat** (2, 6, 10, 14).
- The pattern maintains a consistent, energetic hi-hat rhythm.
