Let's analyze the current groove:

- **K (Kick):** `O---|---o|O-O-|----`  
  - Kick on beats 1 (hard), 2 (soft), and 3 (mixed).
- **S (Snare):** `----|O---|----|O---`  
  - Snare on beats 2 and 4.
- **H (Hi-hat):** `--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`  
  - Hi-hat playing in many subdivisions.
- **T (Toms):** `----|----|----|----` — no toms.
- **C (Crash):** `O---|----|----|----` — crash on beat 1.
- **R (Ride):** `----|----|----|----` — no ride.

**The request** is "less notes," meaning I should simplify or reduce the number of hits. 

**Approach:**

- Keep the main accents but remove some of the less crucial hits.
- For simplicity, I will reduce the hi-hat pattern to only on the first and third beats (to give a more open or sparse feel).
- Keep basic kick and snare patterns with fewer hits.

---

### Proposed plan:

- Remove the hi-hat hits on the 2nd and 4th subdivisions, leaving only the first subdivisions on beats 1 and 3 for the hi-hat.
- Keep the kick and snare pattern simple, with fewer hits.

---

### Construction:

- **K:** Keep only on beat 1 and beat 3, no soft hits, to reduce complexity.
- **S:** Keep snare on beats 2 and 4.
- **H:** Remove most notes, just keep two hits for a more open sound (`-o-|-o-|-o-|-o-`).
- **T:** No toms.
- **C:** Keep crash on beat 1.
- **R:** No ride.

### Final groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|----|----|O---
H: -o--|-o--|-o--|-o--
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----

This version simplifies the overall note density, especially with the hi-hat almost halved, creating a sparser, more open feel.
