Let's analyze the current groove:

- The cymbal line (R):
  - Pattern: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
  - In beat 4 (the last segment), pattern: o-O- 
  - This includes a hit at the start of beat 4 (the first character of the segment).

The instruction is **no cymbal on beat 4**. Currently, there is a cymbal hit at the start of beat 4, which we need to remove.

**Solution:**

- For beat 4: change "o-O-" to "----" to prevent any cymbal hits.

**Other instruments** are fine as they are.

**Final edited groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|----

This removes the cymbal hit in beat 4, complying with the request.
