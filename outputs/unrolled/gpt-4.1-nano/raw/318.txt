Let's analyze the current pattern:

- Kick 'K': OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
  - Kicks on all four beats, with some soft and hard hits.
- Snare 'S': ----|O---|----|O---
  - Snare hits on measure 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat 'H': ----|----|----|----
  - silent.
- Toms 'T': ----|----|----|----
  - silent.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': O---|O---|O---|O---
  - Only crash cymbals on beat 1 of each measure, possibly.

### Goal:
Add more snare to complement the kick pattern, making the groove more compelling with both kick and snare.

### Approach:
- Keep the current kick pattern, which is quite energetic.
- Add a snare hit on the third measure, perhaps on beat 2 or 4 for a backbeat.
- Reinforce the snare hits in measure 4, possibly on beat 2 as well.
- Keep hi-hats silent for simplicity, or add some playing if desired.

### Final plan:
- Keep the existing kick pattern.
- Add snare 'O' on measure 3, beat 2 (note 5-8).
- Add snare 'O' on measure 4, beat 2 (note 5-8).

**Summary:**
- This adds a strong snare second and fourth measure, giving a more driving rhythm.
- Keeps the energetic kick pattern.
- Maintains the crash cymbals on measure 1 to 4.

This creates a lively, balanced groove with both kick and snare while preserving the original energy.
