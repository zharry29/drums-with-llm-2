Let's analyze the current groove:

- The very beginning of the bar (first beat) contains:
  - K: O---
  - S: ----
  - H: --o-
  - T: ----
  - C: O---
  - R: ----

The request is to add a tom hit and a snare hit at the very beginning. The typical approach:
- To emphasize a tom hit, we can use T: either a hit on the first beat (say, across the first 4 characters), such as T: O---
- To emphasize a snare hit, we can add a snare (S) hit at the very start, e.g., an S: with a hit on the first beat, such as S: O---

Given the current groove, the first beat (first 4 characters) is:

- K: O---
- S: ----
- H: --o-
- T: ----
- C: O---
- R: ----

To add a tom and snare at the start:
- For the snare, put S: O--- in the first beat
- For a tom hit, put T: O--- at the beginning as well

Choosing to keep the groove simple, I will place both:
- T: O---
- S: O---

Adjusting the first beat to reflect both hits.

Here's the final plan:
- Keep the rest of the groove as is
- Replace the initial S and T with the new hits

Final approach:
- First beat:
  - K: O---
  - S: O---
  - T: O---
- Keep the rest of the pattern unchanged.

Writing this in the notation:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: O---|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds a snare and tom hit at the very start, as requested, and maintains the pattern's structure.
