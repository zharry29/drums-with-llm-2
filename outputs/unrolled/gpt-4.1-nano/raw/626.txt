To fulfill the request, I will add both a cymbal hit and a kick at the very beginning of the bar.

**Current first beat:**
- K: O--- (hard kick on beat 1)
- S: ---- (no snare)
- H: --o- (soft open hi-hat on the 3rd sixteenth note)
- T: ---- (no toms)
- C: O--- (hard crash cymbal on beat 1)
- R: ---- (no ride cymbal)

**Step 1:** Add a cymbal hit in the first beat. Since there's already a crash cymbal (C: O---), I will leave that as is for emphasizing the cymbal hit.

**Step 2:** The kick (O---) is already present in the first beat, so no change needed here.

Therefore, the changes are minimal: the cymbal crash is already present, aligning with the request.

**Final edited groove:**

S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This version maintains the original groove while emphasizing the cymbal hit at the very beginning.
