Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': O--O | ---- | --O- | ----  
  - Kicks on beat 1, 4, and 3 with varying softness.
- Snare 'S': ---- | Oo-o | -o-- | O--o  
  - Snare hits on beats 2 and 4, with some open and soft hits.
- Hi-hat 'H': X-x- | X-x- | X-x- | X-x-  
  - Consistent hi-hat pattern on all beats with alternating closed and open sounds.
- Toms 'T': ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  
  - None.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': none.

**Request:** Remove all snare and cymbal hits.

### Plan:
- Remove 'S', 'C', and 'R' lines.
- Keep 'K' and 'H' for rhythmic groove if desired, but since the focus is removing snare/cymbals, the core pattern will be just the Kick.
- The hi-hat is playing consistently, so we keep it unless told otherwise.

### Final edited groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

This groove retains the kick and hi-hat pattern, with snare and cymbals removed as requested.
