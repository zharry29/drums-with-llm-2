The given groove has snare (S) and toms (T) lines, which need to be removed according to the request.

- Remove the S line: `----|O---|----|O---`
- Remove T line: `----|----|----|----` (already silent)

Remaining instruments:
- Kick (K): `OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO`
- Hi-hat (H): `----|----|----|----` (silent, can omit)
- Cymbal (C): `O---|O---|O---|O---`
- Ride (R): `----|----|----|----` (silent, can omit)

Since only kick and cymbal are active, the final pattern includes these.

**Final edited groove:**

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
C: O---|O---|O---|O---

This removes snare and toms, leaving only the kick and cymbal patterns.
