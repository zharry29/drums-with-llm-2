**Thought process:**

- The original groove's hi-hat (H) is `x-x-` across all beats; already includes hits in each beat.
- The ride cymbal (R) is silent (`----`) throughout.
- The request is to add a hi-hat hit and a ride cymbal in the very beginning.
- Since the hi-hat already has hits, I will leave it as is, or emphasize the initial hit by changing the first beat to a softer hit if desired.
- For the ride cymbal, change the first beat from `----` to `X---` for a hard ride cymbal hit in the first 16th note.

**Decision:**

- Keep the hi-hat pattern as is (`x-x-`), since it already has hits.
- Change the ride cymbal in the first beat from `----` to `X---`.

This includes a ride cymbal and a hi-hat hit in the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
