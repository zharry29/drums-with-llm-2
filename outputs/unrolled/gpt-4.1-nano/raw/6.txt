Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beat 1 and 3 (hard hits at notes 1 and 5).
- Snare (S): hits on beat 2, last note, and beat 4, last note.
- Hi-hat (H): hits on every beat, consistently closed hi-hat (X) on every sixteenth note.
- Toms (T): none.
- Cymbals (C): none.
- Ride (R): none.

**Objective:** Add some toms to increase variation and fill out the pattern.

**Thought Process:**
- Good places to add toms are around the last notes of beats, especially where there's already activity, for a fill effect.
- I will add a soft tom (o) near the end of beat 2, as a quick fill.
- I will add a hard tom (O) at the very end, after the last snare hit, to create a fill leading into the next measure.

**Placement choices:**
- Beat 2, note 11: add a soft tom (o).
- Beat 4, note 16: add a hard tom (O).

Let's modify accordingly.

**Final groove:**

This adds a soft tom close to the snare on beat 2, and a hard tom at the end of the measure for a rhythmic fill.
