To fulfill the request:

- Add a kick hit at the very beginning: change the K pattern to include an O in the first 16th note position.
- Add a ride hit at the very beginning: change the R pattern to include an O on the first 16th note.

**Step 1:** For the kick (K), the first beat currently is `-O--`, with a soft kick on the second 16th note. We need a hit at the very first note. I will change the pattern to `O---` so that there's a kick on the first 16th note.

**Step 2:** For the ride cymbal (R), currently `----`, change to `O---` for a hit at the first 16th note.

**Final pattern:**

K: O---|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|----|----|----

This now includes a kick and ride cymbal attack at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
