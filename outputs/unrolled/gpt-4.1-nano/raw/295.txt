Let's analyze the original groove and decide how to incorporate the ride cymbal into it.

Original Groove:
- Kick (K): O---|---o|O-O-|----
- Snare (S): ----|O---|----|O---
- Hi-hat (H): --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- Toms (T): ----|----|----|----
- Crash (C): O---|----|----|----
- Ride (R): ----|----|----|----

Currently, there is no ride cymbal played. Usually, the ride is played with a steady pattern, often on the "and" counts or as a ride pattern that complements the hi-hat.

To add the ride:

- I will assign the ride to play a consistent "ping" on the quarter notes or eighth notes, depending on the feel. 
- Since the hi-hat pattern is active, maybe we can have the ride play on the quarter notes, providing a steady shimmer underneath.
- For simplicity, assume ride hits on beat 1 and beat 3 of each measure.

Mapping the ride:

- For each measure (4 beats, each 4 16th notes), let's put ride hits on the first note of beat 1, beat 3, and optionally on beat 2 and 4 to make it more active.

Here's my plan:

Measure 1 (first 16 notes): R hits on the first note of second beat (16th note 5) and third beat (16th note 13). Same pattern in subsequent measures.

Alternatively, for smoother rhythm, place ride on the quarter notes: the first 16th note of each beat: notes 1, 5, 9, 13.

I will place ride hits on those positions (first note of each beat). For simplicity:

- For each beat, ride hit on the first 16th note.

So:

- Measure 1: notes 1-4 (beat 1), 5-8 (beat 2), 9-12 (beat 3), 13-16 (beat 4)
- Place R on notes 1, 5, 9, 13.

In the notation:

- R: R indicators on 1,5,9,13 per measure.

Now, creating the notation:

- For each measure, set R: R--- for the first note (for 1), then --- for the rest of the beat, then R--- for beat 2, etc.

Positioned like this per measure:

Measure 1:

- notes 1-4: R---
- notes 5-8: - - - -
- notes 9-12: R---
- notes 13-16: - - - -

Repeat this pattern for each measure.

Finally, I will assign R to these positions in all measures.

Here's the final new groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
R: R---|R---|R---|R---
C: O---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----

The ride cymbal plays on the first 16th note of each beat, providing a steady ride pattern underneath the groove.
