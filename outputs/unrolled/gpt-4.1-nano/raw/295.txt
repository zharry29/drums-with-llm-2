Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beats 1, 2, and 3, with some soft hits.
- Snare (S): hits on beat 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat (H): a pattern with ghost notes ("--o-", "O-o-", etc.) creating a nuanced texture.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Crash (C): hit on beat 1.
- Ride (R): currently silent.

**Objective:**  
Add a ride cymbal pattern to complement the hi-hat, providing a more complete cymbal support.

### Approach:

- Introduce ride hits ("O---") on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Keep the existing hi-hat ghost notes for texture.
- Maintain the previous kick, snare, and crash hits.

---

### Final plan:

- Add "O---" in the R line on all four beats.
- Preserve the hi-hat pattern as it is for rhythmic nuance.

### Final groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

```

**Summary:**  
- **Ride cymbal ("O---")** now plays on all four beats, giving a steady ride pattern.
- The **hi-hat** ghost notes remain to add subtle texture.
- This creates a fuller, more dynamic cymbal layer supporting the overall groove.
