**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit in the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `O---` to `O---` (this is already a kick, so no change needed for the kick).
- To add a snare hit in the very beginning, change the first beat of S from `----` to `--O-` or `--X-`, depending on the desired articulation. For simplicity, I will choose `--O-` to add a strong, hard snare on the third 16th note of the first beat.

**Implementation:**

- K remains the same at `O---`
- S: from `----` to `--O-`

---

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: --O-|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Result:** A kick and a snare in the very first beat.
