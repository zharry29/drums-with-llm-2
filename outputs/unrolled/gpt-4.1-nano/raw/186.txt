Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits early in beats 1 and 3 ("O--O" and "--O-")
- **Snare (S):** ghost notes on beat 2 ("Oo-o") and some on beat 4 ("O--o")
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** alternating open and closed bell hits, pattern on all beats ("o-O-")

---

### Goal:
Add **tom** (T) and ensure the groove has BOTH **ride (R)** and **tom (T)**.

### Approach:
- Introduce a **tom** hit, perhaps at the end of beat 3 or start of beat 4.
- Keep the ride cymbal pattern but make it more consistent.
- Maintain or enhance the movement of ghost notes on the snare and the kick pattern.

---

### Implementation:
- Add the **tom** hit on beat 4 ("--O-") for variation.
- Keep ride pattern on all beats.
- Possibly reinforce the ride with more consistent hits if needed.

### Final edited groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: o---|o---|o---|o---
T: ----|----|----|O---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

```

**Key changes:**
- **Tom (T):** added on beat 4 ("---O")
- **Hi-hat (H):** opened with "o---" in each beat, adding rhythmic punctuation
- **Ride (R):** remains consistent with bell hits on all beats.

This creates a more layered and textured drum pattern with both ride and tom.
