Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 with open and sidestick hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays on every beat with closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Request:** no hi-hat or snare.

This means removing all H and S lines.

**Result:**

- Keep only the Kick (K) for rhythm.
- No need for T, C, R since they are silent.

### Final pattern:

@@@
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: (removed)
H: (removed)
T: (removed)
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This is a minimalistic groove with just the kick drum, fulfilling the request.
