Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** soft hits ("o") on beat 1 and beat 3.
- **Snare (S):** playing sidesticks ("X") on beat 2 and beat 3.
- **Hi-hat (H):** closed hits ("x") on beat 2 and 4.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** playing on every beat with bell hits ("X-x-").

**Objective:**  
Add a *cymbal* (probably crash) in addition to the *ride* pattern for a layered cymbal texture.

Since the ride pattern is already present, and the instruction says to add "not only cymbal but also ride," the natural approach:

1. Keep the **ride** as is.
2. Add a **crash cymbal** (O) on key downbeats to make the cymbal layer more prominent.

### Final plan:

- Keep the ride pattern ("X-x-") as is.
- Add crash on beat 1 of measure 1 and measure 3 ("O---") for impact.
- Maintain hi-hats as they are.
- Keep snare hits.

### Final groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

```

**Explanation:**

- Crash cymbals ("O---") added at the start of measure 1 and measure 3.
- The ride pattern continues for layered cymbals.
- The groove maintains rhythmic interest with balanced cymbals and percussion.
