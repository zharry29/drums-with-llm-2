Let's analyze the existing groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits with both soft ("O") and no hits.
- **Snare (S):** no hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent with closed hi-hat pattern ("x-x-").
- **Toms (T):** hits in the third measure on beat 3 ("---O").
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on the first three measures, primarily on beats 1 and 2.
- **Ride (R):** no hits.

**The task is to add both a ride cymbal and further toms.**

### Strategy:
- Introduce ride hits mostly on beats 2 and 4 for a steady ride pattern. Use "X" for a strong hit.
- Keep or slightly enhance the tom hits; perhaps add a tom hit in measure 2 or 4 to create a more dynamic pattern.
- Maintain the existing structure and ensure a balanced pattern.

---

### Final plan:
- Add ride hits ("X") on measure 1 beat 4, measure 2 beat 4, and measure 4 beat 4.
- Add a tom hit ("--O-") in measure 4 beat 4 for variation.

### Final groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OOX
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|--O-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|X---

```

**Notes:**
- Ride hits ("X") are aligned on measure 4 beat 4 and supplement the rhythm.
- The tom hit ("--O-") in measure 4 adds flavor.
- The rest of the pattern remains consistent, giving a fuller and more dynamic rhythm incorporating both ride and toms.
