The request is to remove hi-hat (H) and ride (R) lines. 

Looking at the original:
- H line: `X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-` — remove
- R line: `----|----|----|----` — remove (already silent)

Remaining instruments:
- K: `O--O|----|--O-|----`
- S: `----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o`
- C: `----|----|----|----` (silent, can omit)

Since only K and S lines are active, and C is silent, the final pattern includes just the kick and snare.

**Final pattern:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o

This version removes the hi-hat and ride patterns as requested, leaving only kick and snare.
