**Thought process:**

- To add a cymbal hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `O---` to `O---` (still a crash cymbal, no change needed).
- To add a tom in the very beginning, change the first beat of T from `----` to `O---` (a tom hit).
- To ensure both are played together, change T to `O---` and keep C as it is.

**Implementation:**

- T: from `----` to `O---`
- C: keep as `O---` (already a crash cymbal in the first beat)

**Final groove:**

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: O---|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

Now, both a cymbal and a tom hit occur at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
