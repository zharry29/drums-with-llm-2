**Thought process:**

- The original groove:

  - Kick (K): `O---|O---|----|O---` (kick in beats 1, 2, and 4)
  - Snare (S): `----|----|O---|----` (snare on beat 3)

- The request:

  - Add a snare hit and a kick in the very first beat.

- Currently, the first beat of K is `O---` (kick). So, no change needed there.
- The first beat of S is `----` (no snare).

- Change S's first beat from `----` to `O---` (hard snare), in order to have a snare on beat 1.

- The rest of the pattern remains unchanged.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: O---|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**

- First beat includes both a kick and a snare, fulfilling the request.
