Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits at measures 1 and 3, emphasizing downbeats and some off-beats.
- **Snare (S):** accents in the second measure with open and ghost hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent pattern with ghost notes ("X-x-") on all beats for texture.
- **Toms (T), Crash (C), Ride (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add a ride cymbal pattern alongside the hi-hat to create a fuller cymbal layer supporting the groove.

### Approach:
- Keep the existing hi-hat pattern for texture.
- Add ride hits ("O---") on all four beats to give a steady ride pulse.
- Keep the kick and snare pattern as it is, since it already provides a rhythmic foundation.

### Implementation:
- Insert **"O---"** in the R line on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Retain the hi-hat pattern with ghost notes for subtle dynamics.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

```

**Explanation:**  
- The **ride cymbal ("O---")** plays consistently on all four beats, providing a steady rhythmic layer.
- The **hi-hat** ghost notes remain to add texture and dynamics.
- The overall pattern gains a richer cymbal foundation while maintaining the groove's feel.
