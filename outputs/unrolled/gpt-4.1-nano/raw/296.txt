Let's analyze the original groove and plan how to incorporate the ride cymbal.

Original groove:
- K (Kick): O--O|----|--O-|----
- S (Snare): ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- H (Hi-hat): X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
- T (Toms): ----|----|----|----
- C (Crash): ----|----|----|----
- R (Ride): ----|----|----|----

The current groove features hi-hat on every 16th note, alternating between X and x for dynamics, but no ride.

**Objective:** Add a ride cymbal to complement the hi-hat, enriching the overall cymbal pattern.

**Approach:**
- Place the ride on the quarter notes (beats 1, 2, 3, 4), typically on the downbeats or on the "and" of beat.
- For a steady swing feel, let's assign the ride to hit on the first 16th note of each beat, matching the pulse.

**Implementation:**
- For each measure, add 'R' at the first 16th note of each beat.
- Specifically, in each measure:
  - Beat 1: note 1
  - Beat 2: note 5
  - Beat 3: note 9
  - Beat 4: note 13
  
- I will set the ride to hit on these notes with an 'R' character, replacing the 'X' in hi-hat pattern if desired, or adding beside the hi-hat.
- Since the hi-hat pattern is already consistent, I will keep the hi-hat as is and add the ride on the same notes, perhaps using uppercase 'R' to distinguish.

**Note:** Because the hi-hat pattern uses 'X-x-' repeatedly, I will keep it and add 'R' on the downbeats.

**Final plan:**
- Add or replace some notes to include 'R' on 1,5,9,13.
- To keep clarity, I will add the ride hits in new music notation at these positions without removing hi-hat strikes. This will layer the cymbals effectively.

**Constructed pattern:**
- On notes 1, 5, 9, 13, insert 'R' (ride hit).
- For simplicity, I will set the ride hits at the first note of each beat, replacing the 'X' or overlapping with the hi-hat, ensuring the pattern remains lively.

Here's the complete final notation:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
R: R---|R---|R---|R---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----

This version adds a ride cymbal on beats 1 through 4, layered with the hi-hat, creating a fuller rhythmic texture.
