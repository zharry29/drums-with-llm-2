Since the request is to remove all kick (K) and hi-hat (H) parts, I will eliminate those lines entirely. The other instruments—snare (S), toms (T), cymbals (C), and ride (R)—remain, but only the snare and cymbals are active in the original groove.

Looking at the original groove:
- K and H are active; we will remove them.
- S is playing on beat 3, measure 3.
- T is playing on beat 3, measure 3.
- C is playing on beats 1, 2, 3, 4 for all measures.
- R is silent.

To make the groove interesting without kick and hi-hat, I will keep the cymbals (C) and the snare (S), which add rhythmic dynamics.

### Final plan:
- Remove K and H.
- Keep S, C, and R (R is silent, so can be omitted unless adding optional rhythm).
- The snare is active only on beat 3, measure 3.
- The cymbal (C) plays on all beats for a steady accent.
- Toms are silent.

### Final groove:

K: (removed)
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This gives a rhythmic foundation with cymbals and snare, removing kick and hi-hat.
