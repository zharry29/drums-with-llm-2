**Thought process:**

- The original groove shows no snare hit at the start.
- The request is to add a snare hit and a hi-hat hit right at the beginning.
- The hi-hat pattern (H) already has a hit in the second beat (`x---`), but no hit in the first beat.
- The snare (S) has no hit at the start, so I will add a soft snare hit (`o`) at the very beginning.
- For the hi-hat, I will change the first beat from `----` to `x---` to add the hit at the start.

**Implementation:**

- Change first beat of S from `----` to `o---` (snare hit at start).
- Change first beat of H from `----` to `x---` (hi-hat hit at start).

**Final groove:**

This version adds a snare hit (`o---`) and a hi-hat hit (`x---`) at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
