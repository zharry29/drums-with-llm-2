The original groove has no snare (S) or ride (R), so no changes are needed in that regard. To make the groove simpler or more focused, I can consider removing any unused instruments or reaffirm that only the kick and hi-hat are active.

Currently:
- Kick drum (K): O---|O---|----|O---
- Snare (S): ----|----|O---|----
- Hi-hat (H): ----|----|----|----
- Toms (T): O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- Cymbals (C): ----|----|----|----
- Ride (R): ----|----|----|----

Since the snare and ride are not in the pattern, and the request was to remove any snare or ride (which are already absent), I will focus on simplifying further by possibly removing unused instruments.

Final version:
- Keep only K and T (since Toms are active) or just K if desired.

Choosing to keep:
- Kick (K): O---|O---|----|O---
- Toms: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

For simplicity and to keep rhythm, I will remove Toms, leaving just kick and hi-hat (even though the hi-hat is silent). Or I can keep the Toms for flavor.

To satisfy the request, the simplest is:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----

This is a clean, simple groove with just the kick drum active, and no snare or cymbals, matching your request.
