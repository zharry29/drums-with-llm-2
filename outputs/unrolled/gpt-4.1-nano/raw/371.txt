Let's analyze the existing groove:

- Kick 'K': hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 with varying articulation.
- Snare 'S': only on beat 3.
- Hi-hat 'H': no hits.
- Toms 'T': plays soft hits ('O-o-') on all four beats.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': no hits.

**Request:** Remove all toms ('T') and ride cymbal ('R') hits.

Since 'T' has hits, and 'R' currently shows no hits but could be included in a pattern if needed, I will:

- Remove all 'T' hits by setting the 'T' line to all '-'.
- Keep 'R' line as all '-' to exclude ride cymbal sounds.

### Final plan:
- Keep 'K', 'S', and 'H' as they are.
- Remove 'T' and 'R' hits by setting their lines to all '-'.

### Final edited groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This version fulfills the request of eliminating all tom and ride cymbal sounds while maintaining the existing structure of the groove.
