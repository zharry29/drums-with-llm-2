To fulfill the request, I will add a hi-hat hit and a snare hit at the very beginning. That means modifying the first beat (the first four characters in each line).

Original first beat:
- K: -O--
- S: ----
- H: x-x-
- T: ----
- C: O---
- R: ----

**Goals:**
- Add a snare: S: O---
- Add a hi-hat: H: x---

I'll update these lines:
- S: ---- → S: O---
- H: x-x- → H: x-x- (already has a hi-hat hit, so no change needed)
- Keep K, T, C, R as is.

Note: Since there's already a hi-hat in the first beat, I just need to add the snare.

Here's the revised groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: O---|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds a snare hit at the very beginning, along with the existing hi-hat, fulfilling the request.
