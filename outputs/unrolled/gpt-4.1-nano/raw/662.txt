**Thought process:**

- To add a snare hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of S from `----` to `S---`.
- To add a cymbal at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---` (which already is a cymbal hit).

Since the cymbal is already present in the first beat, the main change is adding the snare.

**Implementation:**

- S: `S---`
- C: remains `O---`

---

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: S---|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This introduces a snare hit at the beginning, with the cymbal already in place.
