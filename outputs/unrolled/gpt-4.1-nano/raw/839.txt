**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `-O--`, `OO--`, `---O`, `-OO-`
  - Snare (S): `----`, `----`, `S---`, `----`
  - Hi-hat (H): `x-x-`, `x-x-`, `x-x-`, `x-x-`
  - Toms (T): `----`, `----`, `---O`, `----`
  - Crash (C): `O---`, `O---`, `O---`, `O---`
  - Ride (R): `----`, `----`, `----`, `----`

- Request:
  - Add a kick hit and cymbal in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Change the first beat of K to include a hit, likely from `-O--` to `O---` (a strong kick at start)
  - Add a cymbal hit at the start; since the crash cymbal is represented with `O` and `X`, we can set the first beat of C to `O---` as well or `X---` for more emphasis.

**Note:** To include both, I will set:
- Kick: `O---`
- Crash cymbal: `X---` (for a punchy crash at the very start)

**Final output:**

K: O---|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: X---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**This configuration adds both a kick and a cymbal crash at the very beginning, as requested.**
