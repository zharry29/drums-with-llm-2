Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': no hits.
- Snare 'S': no hits.
- Hi-hat 'H': hits on beats 2 and 4 with soft closed hits ('x').
- Toms 'T': no hits.
- Cymbals 'R': hits on all four beats with mix of open and closed.
- 'C' (crash cymbal): no hits.

**Request:** Remove all toms ('T') and ride cymbal ('R') hits.

Since 'T' has no hits, no change needed there. 'R' has hits, so I will remove those.

**Approach:**
- Set 'R' line to all dashes ('-'), meaning no hits from ride cymbal.

### Final edited groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This removes all ride cymbal hits as requested, keeping the rest of the groove intact with the hi-hat pattern.
