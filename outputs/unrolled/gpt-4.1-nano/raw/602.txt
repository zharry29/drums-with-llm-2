To incorporate a tom hit and a snare in the very beginning:

- The first beat (first 4 characters) currently:
  - K: O--O
  - S: ----
  - H: ----
  - T: ----
  - C: ----
  - R: o-O-

I will:
- Add a snare hit: S: O--- (hard snare at the first beat)
- Add a tom hit: T: O--- (hard tom at the first beat)

Now, I need to replace the first beat segments of these lines accordingly:

- K: keep as O--O
- S: change to O---
- H: keep as ----
- T: change to O---
- C: keep as ----
- R: keep as o-O- (assuming we keep the ride pattern unchanged)

Final edited version:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: O---|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

This adds a snare and a tom hit at the very beginning as requested, while keeping the rest of the groove intact.
