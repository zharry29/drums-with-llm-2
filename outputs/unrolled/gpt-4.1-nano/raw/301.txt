Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beats 1 (O--O) and 3 (--O-)
- Snare (S): has hits on beat 2 ("Oo-o") and beat 4 ("O--o")
- Hi-hat (H): steady pattern with ghost notes ("X-x-")
- Toms (T), Crash (C), Ride (R): silent

**Objective:**  
Add a **ride cymbal** (which is currently not present) and ensure the **snare** contributes to the groove, making it more prominent.

### Approach:
- To add the ride, assign a pattern similar to the hi-hat but typically more prominent, e.g., each beat on the ride has a hit "O---"
- The snare pattern is already somewhat active; I might strengthen or make it more consistent if needed.
- Keep the existing pattern of the hi-hat for texture.

### Implementation:
- Insert **"O---"** in the R line on all four beats.
- Keep the snare's hits on beats 2 and 4, perhaps accentuate by ensuring both beats are active.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|O-o-|----|O-o-
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

```

### Explanation:
- **Snare (S):** now hits on beats 2 and 4 with consistent hits ("O-o" pattern), supporting the backbeat.
- **Ride (R):** hits on all four beats, adding a steady cymbal pulse.
- **Hi-hat:** ghost notes continue for texture.
- **Kick and other percussion:** unchanged, supporting the groove.

This results in a fuller, more balanced pattern with both snare and ride cymbal supporting the groove.
