Let's analyze the current groove first:

- K (Kick): O--O|----|--O-|----
- S (Snare): ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- H (Hi-hat): X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
- T (Toms): ----|----|----|----
- C (Crash): ----|----|----|----
- R (Ride): ----|----|----|----

**Current situation:**
- No ride cymbal; only crash cymbals.
- The snare is present but mainly on the second and last beats, with some ghost notes.

**Objective:**
- Add snare hits to reinforce the backbeat.
- Add ride cymbal hits to give more cymbal color and rhythmic drive.

### Thought process:

- To add snare: include hits on the second and fourth beats (beats 2 and 4, i.e., notes 5-8 and 13-16).
- To add ride: include hits on the downbeats of beats 1 and 3 (notes 1 and 9), and perhaps some on the "and" counts for variation.

### Implementation plan:

- Place 'S' on notes 5-8 and 13-16, emphasizing the backbeat.
- Place 'R' (ride) on note 1 and note 9, providing steady ride pulse on beats 1 and 3.

### Final pattern:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: R---|----|R---|----

**Explanation:**
- Snare hits on beat 2 (notes 5-8) and beat 4 (notes 13-16).
- Ride hits on notes 1 and 9, adding rhythmic clarity.
- The rest of the pattern remains, but it now has both cymbals for a richer sound.

This adjustment emphasizes the groove, giving it more rhythmic stability and color.
