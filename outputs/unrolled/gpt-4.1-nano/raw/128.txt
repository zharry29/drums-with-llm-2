Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 and 3.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 and 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** hits on all beats with closed hi-hat ("X").
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

---

### Goal:
Add the **ride cymbal** along with **toms**. 

**Since the existing groove already has cymbals (C),** and the instruction is to have **not only tom but also ride,** I will:
- Add **ride** hits ("X" or "O") on beats 2 and 4 to create a typical ride pattern.
- Add a **tom** hit ("--O-") on measure 3 beat 3 to add some variation and flavor.

---

### Thought process:
- Place ride hits on measure 2 beat 4 and measure 4 beat 2.
- Add tom hit on measure 3 beat 3.
- Keep everything else unchanged for clarity.

### Final groove:

```

**Summary:**
- Ride cymbal ("X") on measure 2 beat 4 and measure 4 beat 2.
- Tom hit ("--O-") adds flavor on measure 3 beat 3.
- Hi-hat and kick/snare patterns kept consistent.
- Cymbal (C) is already present for fullness.

This arrangement fulfills the requirement of adding both the ride cymbal and toms while maintaining a musical flow.
