To fulfill the request of adding a cymbal hit and a kick at the very beginning:

1. The first beat currently:
- K: O--O (hard kick on beats 1 and 4)
- S: ---- (no snare)
- H: X-x- (hi-hat variations)
- T: ---- (no toms)
- C: ---- (no cymbal)
- R: ---- (no ride)

2. Add a cymbal hit: change C: ---- to C: O---
3. For the kick, it's already present at beat 1 with O, so no change needed.

Here's the plan:
- First beat for C: ---- â†’ O---

Keeping the rest intact, the new groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds a cymbal hit at the very start along with the existing kick pattern, fulfilling the request.
