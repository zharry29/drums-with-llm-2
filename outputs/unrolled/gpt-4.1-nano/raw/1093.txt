Let's analyze the current groove:

- The kick hits on the first beat (O---) and the third beat (O---), with rests in between.
- Snare hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat is played on every sixteenth note with consistent closed hits.
- Toms, crash, and ride are silent.

---

### To double the tempo (double time):

- Every 16th note gets played with the same pattern but at double speed.
- We'll keep the same rhythm foundation but expand it to 32 notes, meaning each original note splits into two.

### Approach:

- The kick should now hit more frequently, perhaps on every downbeat and offbeat, creating a driving pulse.
- The snare should also play more often, acting as a continuous backbeat with ghost notes to add texture.
- The hi-hat will continue to play on every sixteenth at double speed, possibly with added accents for more energy.
- For simplicity, keep Toms, C, and R silent unless we want more complexity.

### Final doubled-time pattern:

```

### Explanation:
- The **kick** now plays on every beat and offbeat (every two sixteenths), creating a relentless drive.
- The **snare** activates on the off-beats, with ghost notes (`o`) adding groove.
- The **hi-hat** continues with steady closed hits (`x`) at double speed, maintaining energy.
- Remaining instruments stay silent for simplicity.

This pattern effectively doubles the tempo feel, creating a high-energy, aggressive groove suitable for metal or fast-paced music.
