To fulfill the request:

- Add a cymbal hit at the very beginning: change C: ---- to C: O---
- The existing kick is already present in the first beat (O---), so no changes needed there.

Here's the final plan:
- Keep the current kick (O---)
- Change the cymbal (C) to have a hit in the first beat (O---)

**Updated groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This sets a cymbal crash and maintains the original kick in the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
