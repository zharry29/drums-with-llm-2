Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 ("O---") and beat 3 ("O---").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("O---") and beat 4 ("O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** steady X hits on all four beats ("X---").
- **Toms (T), Cymbals (C), Ride (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add cymbals, such as crash or ride hits, to enrich the pattern along with the existing snare. Since the groove already has steady hi-hat and a balanced snare pattern, the simplest way is:

- Keep the hi-hat as is.
- Add a crash cymbal ("O---") on beat 1 or beat 3 for emphasis.
- Optionally, add a ride cymbal pattern for more texture; but since the groove already features a crash, I'll focus on adding a crash hit on beat 1 to highlight it.

### Final plan:
- Add **"O---"** in **C** on beat 1 to provide a crash cymbal emphasis.
- Keep the existing snare hits.
- Keep hi-hat steady.

K: O---|----|O---|----

```

### Explanation:
- Crash cymbal hits on beat 1.
- Snare maintains emphasis on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat continues with steady ghost notes for texture.

This creates a more lively, cymbal-supported groove with balanced rhythm.
