**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): all rests
  - Snare (S): all rests
  - Hi-hat (H): `---- | x--- | ---- | x---`
  - Toms (T): all rests
  - Crash (C): all rests
  - Ride (R): `x--- | X-x- | x--- | X-x-`

- Request:
  - Add a kick hit and a tom in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - For the first beat:
    - Change kick (K): from `----` to `O---` to add a kick in the first subdivision.
    - Add a tom hit: T in the first beat from `----` to `-O--`.
    - The hi-hat already has a hit in the first beat (`----` changed to `x---` to emphasize the hi-hat strike).

**Final editing:**

K: O---|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: x---|x---|----|x---
T: -O--|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**This adds a kick hit and a tom in the very beginning as requested, with the hi-hat in place.**
