Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': varies between soft 'o' hits on beats 1, 3, and 2,4.
- Snare 'S': hits on beat 2 and 3 with 'X', which is a hard sidestick hit.
- Hi-hat 'H': plays on beats 2 and 4 with soft closed 'x' hits.
- Toms 'T': silent.
- Cymbals 'R': hits on all four beats with mixtures of 'x' and 'X'.

**Request:** Remove snare 'S' and hi-hat 'H'. 

- We will replace 'S' and 'H' lines with dashes ('-') to silence those instruments.

Remaining parts are kick 'K' and cymbals 'R'. 

### Final version:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This keeps kick and cymbals only, matching the request to remove snare and hi-hat.
