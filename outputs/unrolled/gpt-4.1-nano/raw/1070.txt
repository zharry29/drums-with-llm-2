Let's analyze the current groove:

- The **kick** (`K`) hits on the first and third subdivisions of some beats (`O--O`, `--O-`), providing a basic pulse.
- The **snare** (`S`) has some ghost notes (`o`) and accented hits (`O`) on beats 2 and 4, creating a lively pattern with ghost notes already present.
- The **hi-hat** (`H`) is silent.
- The **toms**, **cymbals**, and **ride** are silent.
- The **ride cymbal** (`R`) plays a pattern with open bell hits (`o-O-`) and closed hits (`o-O-`) across all beats, adding rhythmic texture.

**Objective:**  
Enhance the snare with more ghost notes to enrich the groove further without disrupting the existing pattern.

### Thought process:
- The snare already has ghost notes (`o`) interspersed with main hits.
- To make the groove more dynamic, introduce additional ghost notes just before the main snare hits to create a subtle push-pull feel.
- For each main snare hit (`O`), we can add ghost notes (`o`) immediately before or after.

### Final plan:
- Add ghost notes (`o`) before the main hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Insert ghost notes just before and after existing ghost notes to deepen the texture.

**Summary:**
- Ghost notes (`o`) have been added before main snare hits to increase subtle rhythmic variation.
- Maintains the original groove's feel but with richer, more complex snare activity.
- Enhances groove depth while keeping the core pattern intact.
