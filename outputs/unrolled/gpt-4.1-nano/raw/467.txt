Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4 with various articulations.
- **Snare (S):** only on beat 3 with a sidestick hit.
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays on every 16th note with alternating open and closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** on beat 3 with a hard hit.
- **Cymbals (C):** on beats 1, 2, and 3.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Request:** no hi-hat or snare.

**Action:** remove the S and H lines entirely.

The remaining instruments with hits: K, T, C, R.

- Since R and T are silent, and C is active only in the first two beats, but as per original, only in beats 1-3, I will keep the C and T patterns as is.

### Final plan:

- Remove S and H lines.
- Keep K, C, T, R.
- K, C, T, R are compatible with the original notation.

### Result (final pattern):

@@@
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: (removed)
H: (removed)
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

### Final output:
