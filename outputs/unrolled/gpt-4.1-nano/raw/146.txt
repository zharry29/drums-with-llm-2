Let's analyze what the current groove has:

- **Kick (K):** hits at measure 1 ("O--O") and measure 3 ("--O-").
- **Snare (S):** hits at measure 2 (O-o-), measure 2, beat 3 ("-o--"), and measure 4 ("O--o").
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent (all "-").
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** pattern of alternating open hits on the bell.

**Goal:**  
Add **hi-hat** (though currently missing) and **more prominent or supportive snare**, possibly replacing some of the existing snare hits or adding new ones for rhythmic support.

---

### Approach:
- Since hi-hat is not present, add a consistent pattern to provide steady pulse, e.g., "*x---*" on all beats.
- Keep the existing snare pattern, but perhaps add an extra snare hit at measure 3, beat 3 ("--S-") for variation and rhythmic push.
- Alternatively, replace the snare pattern slightly to make the groove more balanced and cohesive with the hi-hat.

---

### Implementation plan:
- Add hi-hat as "x-x-" pattern on all beats.
- Add a snare hit in measure 3, beat 3 ("--S-").
- Keep kick pattern as is.

---

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|--S-|O--o
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

```

**Summary:**  
- Hi-hat: now active with "x-x-" pattern, providing a steady rhythm foundation.
- Snare: enhanced with an additional hit on measure 3, beat 3 ("--S-").
- Kick remains unchanged, maintaining the groove's foundation.
  
This creates a balanced rhythm with support from both snare and hi-hat, aligning with the edit request.
