**Thought process:**

- Current kick (K): `-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-` (kick on 2nd and 4th beats, first beat has no kick)
- Current snare (S): `----|----|S---|----` (snare only on the third beat)

- The request:
  - Add a snare and a kick in the *very first* beat.

- Since the first beat of K is `-O--`, a soft kick, and the first beat of S is `----`, we need to:

  - Keep the kick as is, because it's already played in the first beat (`-O--`).
  - Change snare's first beat from `----` to `O---` to add a snare in the first beat.

**Final groove:**

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: O---|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**

- The first beat contains both a kick (`-O--`) and a snare (`O---`), fulfilling the request without altering other parts of the groove.
