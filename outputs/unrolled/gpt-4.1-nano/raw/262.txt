Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 ("O--O") and 3 ("--O-")
- **Snare (S):** plays on beat 2 ("Oo-o") and beat 4 ("O--o")
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (C):** silent
- **Ride cymbal (R):** pattern with alternating open and closed hits ("o-O-")

**Goal:**  
Add a hi-hat pattern to ensure both cymbal and hi-hat are present, supporting the groove rhythmically.

**Approach:**
- Introduce a consistent closed hi-hat pattern on each beat, for example, "x---" repeating across all four beats.
- Keep the cymbal pattern existing in the R line.
- Make the hi-hat subtle but present, complementing the existing cymbal rhythm.

---

### Final plan:
- Place "x---" for the hi-hat on beats 1 to 4.
- Keep the existing cymbal pattern as it is.
- Keep the kick and snare pattern unchanged.

---

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----

H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

```

**Summary:**  
- The hi-hat now plays on all four beats ("x---"), ensuring the pattern includes both cymbal and hi-hat.  
- The groove remains cohesive with the previous elements, now with both cymbal and hi-hat support.
