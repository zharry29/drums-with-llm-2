Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 (hard hit "O") and 3 ("--O-").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 with some variety ("Oo-o", "-o--", "O--o").
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash cymbal (C):** silent.
- **Ride cymbal (R):** hits on every beat with alternating open and closed sounds ("o-O-", "o-O-", "o-O-", "o-O-").

The pattern already includes ride cymbal hits on each beat via R. No crash cymbal is present currently. The groove has a lively ride, but to fulfill the request to emphasize cymbals more, I can:

- Keep the ride pattern (as it is, supporting the beat).
- Add a crash cymbal hit on beat 1 or 3 to add emphasis.
- Maybe strengthen the existing cymbal hits (like adding a crash on beat 1 and 3).

### Approach:
- Keep the ride cymbal pattern as is.
- Add a crash cymbal "O---" on beat 1, and optionally on beat 3 for accent.
- Keep snare as it is, since it's already providing rhythmic support.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

```

### Explanation:
- Added **"O---"** in **C** (crash cymbal) on beats 1 and 3 to provide additional cymbal accents.
- The ride pattern stays active throughout.
- The snare pattern remains intact for rhythmic backbeat.
- Keeps the groove dynamic and full with both cymbals and snare.

This results in a fuller, more energetic pattern emphasizing cymbals along with the rest of the kit.
