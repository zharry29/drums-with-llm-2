**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits at first (`O---`) and third (`O---`)
  - Snare (S): hits on second (`O---`) and last (`O---`)
  - Hi-hat (H): hits on every beat with closed hits (`X---`)
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): silent

- Request:
  - Add a snare hit and a ride hit in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Place a snare (`O`) at the first subdivision in S
  - Place a ride (`O`) at the first subdivision in R

K: O---|----|O---|----

T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

**This includes a snare and a ride hit at the very beginning, as requested.**
