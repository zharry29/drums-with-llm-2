Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays with combinations of O and o, providing rhythmic drive.
- Snare (S): plays on the second and last beats.
- Hi-hat (H): all silent.
- Toms (T): all silent.
- Crash cymbal (C): plays on every beat with O and O.
- Ride cymbal (R): all silent.

**The user requests to remove all hi-hat and cymbal sounds.**

Therefore, we will eliminate the H, C, and R lines. The resulting pattern includes only the kick and snare, which are essential for a basic rhythm.

Original pattern after removing hi-hat and cymbal:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
S: ----|O---|----|O---

This is a solid pattern with a driving kick and a snare accent on the last beat.

**Final step:** craft the new groove with only the remaining instruments.

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: (removed)
T: (removed)
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This maintains a lively, rhythmic foundation with kick and snare, fitting the request.
