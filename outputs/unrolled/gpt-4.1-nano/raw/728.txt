**Thought process:**

- The original groove has no hi-hat hits at the beginning.
- To fulfill the request, I will add a hi-hat hit (`x---`) in the very first beat.
- Additionally, I will add a cymbal—most likely a crash cymbal (`O---`)—also at the very start.
- The cymbal should be set on the first beat, which is in the first column line.

**Implementation:**

- First beat of H: change from `----` to `x---`
- First beat of C: change from `----` to `O---`

**Final groove:**

This version adds a hi-hat hit and cymbal hit right at the beginning, as requested.
