**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits at first beat (`O--O`) and third beat (`--O-`)
  - Snare (S): hits on second beat with mixed open and closed hits (`Oo-o`) and last beat (`O--o`)
  - Hi-hat (H): silent
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): hits on every subdivision with alternating open and closed (`o-O-` and `o-O-` pattern)

- Request:
  - Add a ride hit and a snare in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - Place a ride hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in R.
  - Place a snare hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in S.

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: O---|Oo-o|--o-|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O-o-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

**The newly added ride hit and snare are now at the beginning, fulfilling the request.**
