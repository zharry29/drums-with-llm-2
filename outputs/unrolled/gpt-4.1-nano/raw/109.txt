Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 ("O") and beat 2 ("o"), with no other hits.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 and beat 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays a busy pattern with alternating open and closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on beat 1.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Goal:**  
Add toms to the groove for more rhythmic variation, while reinforcing the kick pattern, possibly with some softer hits to complement the groove, and maintain the energy.

### Approach:
- Introduce a tom hit on beat 3, perhaps "O" for a strong accent.
- Reinforce kicks with additional softer "o" on the off-beats.
- Keep the existing hi-hat pattern for consistent pulse.
- Maintain the snare pattern.

---

### Final plan:
- Kick: keep the existing hits, and add softer "o" on off-beats.
- Toms: add a hit on beat 3 ("-O-") for variation.
- Hi-hat: keep as busy as before.
- Snare and cymbals stay the same.

### Final groove:

H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

R: ----|----|----|----

**Summary:**  
- The kick pattern is reinforced with an occasional softer hit ("o").
- The tom now hits on beat 3, adding rhythmic interest.
- The hi-hat pattern remains active to drive the tempo.
- Snare emphasizes beats 2 and 4 for a solid backbeat.

This creates a fuller, more energetic rhythm suitable for building sections of a song.
