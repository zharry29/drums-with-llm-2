Let's first analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': soft hits on beats 1, 3, and 4, with soft hits ('o').
- Snare 'S': hits on beats 2 and 3 with sidesticks ('X').
- Hi-hat 'H': soft open hits ('x') on beats 2 and 4.
- Toms 'T': no hits.
- Cymbals 'R': hits on all beats with both open and closed hits.

**Request:** Remove all toms ('T') and ride cymbal ('R') hits.

Since 'T' is already empty, and 'R' has hits, I will remove the 'R' hits, which are on all beats with 'X-x-' pattern.

**Approach:**
- Set all 'R' line characters to '-' (no hits).

### Final groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This version removes all 'R' hits, fulfilling the request, and keeps the rest of the groove intact.
