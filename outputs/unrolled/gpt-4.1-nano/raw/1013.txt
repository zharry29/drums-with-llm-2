Let's analyze the current groove:

- The Toms are silent (`----|----|----|----`), so to make it more dynamic, we should activate them with patterning and accents.
- Other instruments already have some activity, but we want to bring more energy and variation.

### Goal:
Add a more lively, expressive Toms pattern while keeping the same placement (all four beats). Use accents (X or O) and vary soft/hard hits for dynamics.

### Approach:
1. For each beat, add a Toms hit:
   - On beat 1: a loud (X) or accented (O) tom.
   - On beat 2: a softer, offbeat hit.
   - On beat 3: an accented, louder hit.
   - On beat 4: a softer hit, possibly with some variation.

2. Use different articulations:
   - Strong hits (X, O).
   - Softer hits (x, o).

### Proposed pattern:
- Beat 1: `X---` (strong downbeat)
- Beat 2: `--o-` (softer, off-beat)
- Beat 3: `O---` (accented)
- Beat 4: `--o-` (soft off-beat)

### Final pattern:
`X---|--o-|O---|--o-`

### Final groove:

This adds dynamic variation to the Toms, making the overall groove more lively and expressive while maintaining their placement.
