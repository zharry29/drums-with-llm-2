Let's analyze the original groove and the request:

- The **second beat** is the segment **O---|O---** (notes 5-8).
- The goal is to have **snare hits on every 16th note in the second beat**, meaning notes 5, 6, 7, and 8 should all have snare hits.

Currently, **snare (S)** has only one hit in the third beat, which is not relevant. We need to add snare hits into the second beat segment, specifically on notes 5-8.

Since the second beat notes are four individual 16th notes, to get snare on each of these, I will place **O** (hard snare) on all four notes in the second beat.

### Step-by-step:

- The second beat is **O---|O---**, representing notes 5-8.
- Replace note 5, 6, 7, 8 in the snare line with **O** (hard hit).

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|OOOO|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This now has snare hits on every 16th note of the second beat, fulfilling the request. Other parts remain the same, and total note count increased minimally but notably. The focus was on snare placement.
