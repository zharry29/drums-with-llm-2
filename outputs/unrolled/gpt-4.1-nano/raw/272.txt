Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent closed hi-hat hits ("X---") for all beats.
- **Toms, Cymbals, Ride:** silent in the current pattern.

**Objective:**  
Add a ride cymbal pattern while ensuring the kick remains prominent. Since the existing groove has a strong kick on beats 1 and 3, and a snare on 2 and 4, I will add the ride cymbal on beats 2 and 4 for a steady ride pattern and reinforce the groove.

### Approach:
- Keep the existing kick pattern.
- Keep the hi-hat ghost notes ("X---") unchanged for texture.
- Add ride cymbal "O---" on beat 2 and beat 4.

### Final plan:
- Add ride hits on the second and fourth beats.
- Keep existing kick and hi-hat.

### Final groove:

```

**Explanation:**
- Ride cymbal ("O---") added on beats 2 and 4.
- Kick pattern remains the same.
- Hi-hat ghost notes continue for texture.
- Creates a fuller, more rhythmically driven groove with both kick and ride cymbal.
