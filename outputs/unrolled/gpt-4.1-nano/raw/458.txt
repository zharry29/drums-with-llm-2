Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): silent throughout.
- Snare (S): silent.
- Hi-hat (H): plays on beats 2 and 4, with soft open hits.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C): silent.
- Ride (R): plays on beats 1 and 3 with mixed closed and open hits.

The request is to remove all cymbal and hi-hat parts.

Approach:

- Remove the H and C lines entirely.
- Keep K, S, T, and R.
- R is a ride cymbal, so it should also be removed according to the request (no cymbal).

Final plan:

- Keep the kick (K) and snare (S).
- Remove H, C, and R.

Final groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
R: (removed)
C: (removed)
H: (removed)

This results in a bare rhythm with no cymbals or hi-hat, just silenceâ€”making it suitable for adding a new pattern later or keeping a minimalistic approach.
