Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** silent across all four beats.
- **Snare (S):** silent.
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes on beat 2 ("x---") and beat 4 ("x---").
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** pattern with soft and hard closed hits, alternating in all beats ("X-x-", "X-x-", "x---", "X-x-").

### Goal:
Add a tom pattern along with the existing cymbal ride for more depth and musical interest.

---

### Approach:
- Incorporate a tom hit, typically on beat 3 or 4, for fills.
- For example, add a tom hit ("--O-") on beat 3.
- Optionally, add a tom fill on beat 4 like ("---O") to further enhance the texture.
- Keep the cymbal pattern as is, as it complements the overall groove.

---

### Finalized plan:
- Place a tom hit ("--O-") on beat 3.
- Place a tom hit ("---O") on beat 4.
- Keep the kick and snare silent for simplicity, focusing on rhythmic depth through the toms and ride.

---

### Final groove:

K: ----|----|----|----

H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|--O-|---O
C: ----|----|----|----
R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

```

**Explanation:**
- Toms on beat 3 ("--O-") and beat 4 ("---O") provide variation and fills.
- Hi-hat ghost notes remain unchanged.
- The cymbal ride pattern persists to maintain the groove's texture.
- Kick and snare remain silent, but they can be added later if desired.

This pattern now includes rhythmic fills with the toms for more musical expression.
