Let's analyze the timing:

- The second beat spans notes 5-8.
- The subdivision sequence "1 e & a" corresponds to:
  - 1: note 5
  - e: note 6
  - &: note 7
  - a: note 8
  
- The "a" of beat 2 is **note 8**, which is the last sixteenth note of the second beat.

In the notation:

- The second beat's characters are from position 6 to 9 (since each beat is 4 characters, separated by `|`).

- The character for note 8 is the **4th character of the second group**.

Looking at the input groove:

`K: O---|---o|O-O-|----`  
`S: ----|O---|----|O---`  
`H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`  
`t: ----|----|----|----`  
`C: O---|----|----|----`  
`R: ----|----|----|----`

The second beat characters are as follows:

- K: positions 6-9 -> `---o` (positions 6='-', 7='-', 8='-', 9='o')
- S: positions 6-9 -> `O---`
- H: positions 6-9 -> `O-o-`
- T: positions 6-9 -> `----`
- C: positions 6-9 -> `----`
- R: positions 6-9 -> `----`

The note 8 corresponds to the **4th character in the second group**: 

- For the second beat, **character 9** (since the second group is positions 6-9). 

- Currently, this position is a `'-'` in the `K` line, `O` in the `S` line, `-` in `H`, etc.

**Action:**

- Change the character at position 9 in the `K` line from `'-'` to `'O'` to add a cymbal hit on 'a'.

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

**Only change:** In the `K` line, the last character of the second beat shifted from `'-'` to `'O'` to add the cymbal hit on the 'a'.
