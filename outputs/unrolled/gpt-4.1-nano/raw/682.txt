**Thought process:**

- To add a cymbal hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---` (crash cymbal).
- To add a tom in the very beginning, change the first beat of T from `O-o-` to `O---` (tom hit).
- Both should occur simultaneously at the start, so replace T's first beat with `O---`.

**Implementation:**

- T: from `O-o-` to `O---`
- C: from `----` to `O---`

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:** Both a cymbal hit and a tom hit are now in the very first beat, fulfilling the requested edits.
