Let's analyze the current pattern:

- **Kick (K):** soft hits on beat 1 and 3 ("o---", "o---")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("X---") and beat 3 ("--X-")
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes ("x---") on beat 2 and beat 4
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbal (R):** mixed soft and hard hits on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4 ("x---", "X-x-", "x---", "X-x-")

The request is to ensure the groove features both cymbal and hi-hat simultaneously, providing a fuller rhythmic texture.

**Approach:**
- Keep the hi-hat ghost notes ("x---") to maintain subtle texture.
- Reinforce the hi-hat with more consistent hits if needed.
- Add or emphasize cymbal hits if desired for accentuation (already present but can be slightly reinforced).

Since the groove already features hi-hat ghost notes, I will keep the pattern but perhaps refine for clarity and rhythmic support. The cymbal pattern is acceptable, so I might keep it as is.

**Final plan:**
- Keep the hi-hat ghost notes as present.
- Ensure the cymbal pattern remains.
- Possibly add a more consistent closed hi-hat on all beats for a more driving feel if needed.

But since the groove already contains ghosted hi-hat notes that are subtle, I will just reinforce them by keeping the same pattern and adding a crash cymbal on beat 1 for extra emphasis.

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

```

### Explanation:
- Kept the ghost notes but made sure they support the pattern.
- Added a crash cymbal ("O---") on beat 1 to give emphasis at the start.
- Maintained the cymbal hits for rhythm and accentuation.

This ensures the groove has both cymbal and hi-hat, complementing each other rhythmically.
