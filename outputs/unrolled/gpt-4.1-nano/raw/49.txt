To add some hi-hat ('H') to the groove, I will incorporate consistent closed hi-hat hits on interesting subdivisions, ensuring the groove maintains a lively rhythm. Currently, the hi-hat line has open hits ('x---') on the second and fourth beats.

I'll add closed hi-hat hits ('x') on other subdivisions to create a more continuous hi-hat pattern:

- For more drive, let's place 'x' on the first and third beats as well, perhaps on some subdivisions for variation.

Here's my plan:

- Keep the existing hits ('x---' on beat 2 and 4)
- Add 'x' on the first beat subdivision, e.g., in the first quarter
- Keep or slightly adjust the fourth beat for emphasis

Let's do this:

**Existing H line:**

`----|x---|----|x---`

I'll modify it to:

`x---|x---|x---|x---`

This creates a steady eighth-note hi-hat pattern.

**Final plan:**

- Replace the H line with a consistent closed hi-hat 'x' on all 16th notes.

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This adds steady hi-hat to the groove, making it more lively.
