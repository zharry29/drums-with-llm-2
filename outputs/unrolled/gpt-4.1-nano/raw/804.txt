**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits on first, second, and last beats with different articulations
  - Snare (S): hits on the third beat
  - Hi-hat (H): silent
  - Toms (T): pattern with alternating soft and hard hits
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): silent

- Request:
  - Add a ride hit and snare in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Place a ride hit (`O`) in the first subdivision of R.
  - Place a snare hit (`O`) in the first subdivision of S.

**This includes a ride hit and a snare in the very beginning as requested.**
