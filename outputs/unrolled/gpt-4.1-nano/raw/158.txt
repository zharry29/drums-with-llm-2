Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits are on beat 1 ("O--O") and beat 3 ("--O-")
- **Snare (S):** hits are on beat 2 and 4 with variety ("--o--", "-o--", "O--o")
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (R):** alternating hits ("o-O-") on all four beats

**Goal:**  
Add a more active kick pattern and possibly more cymbal activity, as well as support the groove with snare.

### Approach:
- To complement the existing kick pattern, add additional kick hits on the "off" beats, e.g., in beat 2 and beat 4 ("--O-")
- Keep the cymbal pattern intact but reinforce it if desired.

### Final plan:
- Keep kick pattern on beats 1 and 3, and add kick hits on beats 2 and 4 to create a driving rhythm ("O-O-")
- Keep existing cymbal hits.
- Keep snare hits as they are for a dynamic rhythm.
