**Thought process:**

- To include a ride hit at the very beginning, I will change the first beat (first 4 characters of R) from `----` to `O---`.
- To add a tom at the beginning, I will change the first beat (first 4 characters of T) from `----` to `O---`.

**Implementation:**

- R: `O---` (adding ride hit)
- T: `O---` (adding a tom hit at the start)

The rest of the pattern remains unchanged.

**Final groove:**

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: O---|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|----|----|----

This includes both a ride hit and a tom at the very start, as requested.
