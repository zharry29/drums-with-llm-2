**Thought process:**

- The original groove has no cymbal (C) or snare (S) hits in the first beat.
- The request is for a cymbal hit and a snare in the very beginning.
- For the snare, change the first beat of S from `----` to `O---`.
- For the cymbal, change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---`.
- The rest of the pattern can stay unchanged.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: O---|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**  
Now, both a cymbal hit and a snare hit are in the very first beat, as instructed.
