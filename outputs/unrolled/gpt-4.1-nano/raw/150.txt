Let's analyze the existing groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 ("O---"), beat 2 ("---o"), and beat 3 ("O-O-")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("O---") and beat 4 ("O---")
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays steady open and closed pattern ("--o-", "O-o-"), alternating between open and closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (C, R):** Silent

The groove already has snare and hi-hat, but perhaps the request is to make it more dynamic, emphasize the snare more, and ensure the hi-hat supports that.

### Approach:
- Enhance the snare pattern, maybe add an extra hit in measure 3.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern, but possibly make it more consistent or slightly busier.
- Keep kick pattern intact for rhythm foundation.

### Implementation:
- Add a snare in measure 3, beat 3 ("--S-") for a more driving pattern.
- Keep the hi-hat as is, perhaps with slight variation, or add a softer hi-hat in measure 1 for balance.

### Final groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|--S-|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

**Summary:**
- Snare is reinforced with an extra hit on measure 3, beat 3.
- Hi-hat remains active, supporting the groove.
- Kick remains unchanged, maintaining rhythmic stability.

This creates a rhythmically interesting pattern with emphasis on snare and a lively hi-hat.
