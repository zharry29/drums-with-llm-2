Let's analyze the current groove:  
- **Kick:** on beats 1 and 3 with "O--O" pattern.  
- **Snare:** on beats 2 and 4 with some ghost strokes.  
- **Hi-hat:** consistent pattern with X and x on every 16th note, giving sixteenth note hi-hat pulse.  
- **Toms, C, R:** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add a ride cymbal pattern to complement the existing groove and support the snare, while maintaining overall balance.

---

### Approach:
- Keep the snare pattern for backbeats.
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4, which is a common placement.
- Since the hi-hat carries the pulse, the ride will add additional shimmer and rhythmic support without replacing the hi-hat.
- Keep the kick pattern for rhythm foundation.

---

### Implementation:
- Add ride hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep existing groove intact.

### Final groove:

H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|--O-|----|--O-

```

### Explanation:
- Ride cymbal added on beats 2 and 4 ("--O-") in the ride line.
- Hi-hat and snare patterns kept intact.
- Kick remains as initially, providing a strong rhythmic backbone.
- The groove now has a balanced pattern with both snare and ride cymbals enhancing the overall texture.
