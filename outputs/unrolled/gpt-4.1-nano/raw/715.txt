**Thought process:**

- To add both a hi-hat hit and a ride cymbal in the very beginning:
  - The hi-hat (H) in the first beat is currently `----`, so I will change it to `x---` to include a hi-hat hit on the first 16th note.
  - The ride cymbal (R) in the first beat is `x---`, which already has a hit, but in the context of the previous example, earlier ride was absent. To emphasize the ride, I will change `x---` to `X---` to indicate a harder, more prominent hit.
- The rest of the groove remains unchanged.

**Summary:** Cornerstone bits (hi-hat and ride) are now present at the very start, fulfilling the request.
