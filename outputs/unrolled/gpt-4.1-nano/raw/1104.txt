Let's analyze the current groove:

- The kick (`K`) hits on the first and third beats with hard hits (`O`), providing a basic pulse.
- The snare (`S`) hits on beat 2 and 4 (`O`) creating a backbeat.
- The hi-hat (`H`) is playing closed hits (`X`) evenly throughout, adding a bright, high-frequency texture.
- Toms, cymbals, and ride are silent.

### Goal:
Make the groove more bass-heavy by emphasizing low frequencies, primarily through more prominent kick drum, and reducing higher-frequency sounds such as the hi-hat.

### Approach:
- Add more kick drum hits, possibly on all subdivisions, with some soft hits (`o`) for variation.
- Remove or reduce hi-hat hits to diminish the higher frequencies.
- Keep snare hits for rhythm but focus on lower frequencies.

```

### Explanation:
- The kick (`K`) hits on every subdivision with alternating soft and hard hits, reinforcing the low-frequency pulse.
- The hi-hat (`H`) is completely silenced to omit high frequencies.
- The snare (`S`) continues on beat 4 for a solid rhythm.
- The overall groove is now bass-focused with a steady low-end drive.

This results in a more bass-heavy, low-frequency-centered pattern suitable for emphasizing depth and bass presence.
