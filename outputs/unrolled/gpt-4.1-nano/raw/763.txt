**Thought process:**

- The original groove:

  - Kick (K): `-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-` (kick in various parts)
  - Snare (S): `----|----|S---|----` (snare only on beat 3 in the third measure)
  - Hi-hat (H): `x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-` (hi-hat on every subdivision with alternating open/closed)
  - Toms (T): `----|----|---O|----` (single hit on beat 3)
  - Crash (C): `O---|O---|O---|O---` (crash on each beat)
  - Ride (R): `----|----|----|----` (silent)

- The request: add a hi-hat hit and a kick in the very first beat.

- Currently:
  - Kick in first beat: `-O--` (soft kick)
  - Hi-hat in first beat: `x-x-` (already present)

- To emphasize both, I will:

  - Keep the kick as soft (`o`) or hard (`O`) â€” I prefer to keep it as `O` for impact.
  - Keep the hi-hat as closed (`x`) at the start.

- Since both are already present, the pattern actually already satisfies the request.

**Conclusion:**

The existing groove already includes a kick and hi-hat in the first beat.

**Final groove:**

This pattern already contains both the kick and hi-hat in the first beat, fulfilling the user's request.
