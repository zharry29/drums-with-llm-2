**Thought process:**
- To add a hi-hat hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of H from `--o-` to a consistent hi-hat hit, such as `x---` for a soft closed hi-hat.
- To add a tom at the very start, change the first beat of T from `----` to `O---`.

**Implementation:**
- T: `O---` (tom hit)
- H: `x---` (hi-hat hit)

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This now begins with both a hi-hat hit and a tom hit, as requested.
