Let's analyze the given groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits mainly on measures 1 and 3, sometimes on 2.
- **Snare (S):** hits on measure 2 beat 1 ("O") and measure 4 beat 4 ("O").
- **Hi-hat (H):** currently silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on all measures with "O" at the start of each measure.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

---

### Goal:
Add **hi-hat** and **toms** to this groove.

### Approach:
- Reintroduce or emphasize hi-hat pattern. Let's add consistent **closed hi-hat hits ("x")** on all beats for a steady rhythmic pulse.
- Add some tom hits, maybe on measure 3 beat 3 ("---O") or measure 4 beat 3 for variation.

### Implementation:
- Insert hi-hat hits ("x") on all parts of each measure.
- Add a tom hit (say, in measure 3 beat 3).

---

### Final version:
- Hi-hat: add "x" on every 16th note pattern.
- Toms: add "O" in measure 3 beat 3.

---

### Final groove:

H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|--O-|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

```

**Summary:**
- Hi-hat ("x") on all beats, providing a steady rhythmic layer.
- Tom hit ("--O-") added in measure 3 beat 3 for flavor.
- Rest of the pattern remains intact, giving a well-rounded, grooving pattern with both hi-hat and toms.
