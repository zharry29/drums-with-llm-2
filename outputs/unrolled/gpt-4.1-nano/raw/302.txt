Let's analyze the existing groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on the 1st beat and third beat ("O---" and "O---")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 ("O---" and "O---")
- **Hi-hat (H):** steady pattern with open hi-hat ghost notes ("X---" on each beat)
- **Toms (T), Crash (C), Ride (R):** silent

**Objective:**  
Add a **ride cymbal** and reinforce or expand the **snare** pattern so that both are prominent. The ride cymbal typically hits on each beat or with some variation, complementing the hi-hat.

### Approach:
- Introduce **ride (R)** hits on every beat, e.g., "O---" for each beat.
- Keep the snare hits on beats 2 and 4 but consider making them more prominent or adding variation.
- Maintain the hi-hat ghost notes for texture.

### Proposed plan:
- Let **R** have "O---" on all four beats.
- Keep **S** on beats 2 and 4 with maybe some variation or ghost notes.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern.

### Final groove draft:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

**Explanation:**
- **Snare (S):** remans on beats 2 and 4 for clarity.
- **Ride (R):** hits on every beat, supporting the groove.
- **Hi-hat:** ghost notes continue for texture.
- **Kick:** remains on beats 1 and 3.
- **Other instruments:** silent to keep focus on the core rhythm.

This creates a fuller and more driving rhythm with both snare and ride present, supporting a solid groove.
