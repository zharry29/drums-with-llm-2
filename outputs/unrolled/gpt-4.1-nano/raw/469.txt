Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays on beats 1 and 3 with loud hits.
- **Snare (S):** plays on beats 2 and 4 with hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent closed hits on all four beats.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Request:** no snare or kick. So, remove the S and K lines entirely. 

The remaining instruments are H, T, C, R. In the original, T, C, R lines are silent, so for a more interesting rhythm, I can assign a simple pattern to the cymbal or leave everything silent if desired.

**Final plan:** keep only the hi-hat or create a minimal pattern with just the cymbal on beats 1 and 3.

### Final pattern:

@@@
K: (removed)
S: (removed)
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

This keeps a basic steady closed hi-hat pattern, with no snare or kick, fulfilling the request.

**Final answer:**

``` 
@@@
K: (removed)
S: (removed)
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
