Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits are frequent, with patterns of strong hits ("OOO-") on beat 1 and "O O" on beat 2 and 4.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("O---") and beat 4 ("O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4 ("O---" repeated).
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### Goal:
Add toms to this groove, which currently contains no tom hits.

### Approach:
- Introduce tom hits to add variations, fills, or accents.
- For a balanced pattern, place a tom hit on beat 3 ("--O-") as a punch, and optionally another on beat 4 ("---O") as a fill.
- Keep the existing rhythm, especially the snare pattern and kick pattern.

---

### Final pattern:
- Add **tom** hits on beat 3 ("--O-") and beat 4 ("---O").

### Final groove:

**Summary:**  
- Toms are now present on beats 3 and 4, creating fills that complement the existing groove while maintaining the rhythm pattern.
