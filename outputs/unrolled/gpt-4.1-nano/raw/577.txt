First, I will remove the ride cymbal line (R) entirely, as per the request. The current groove includes:

- K: kick
- S: snare
- H: hi-hat
- T: toms
- C: crash cymbal
- R: ride cymbal

Since we no longer want ride or crash cymbal, I will delete the lines for R and C. That leaves only K, S, H, and T.

Now, I will examine the remaining instruments:

- Kick: `O--O|----|--O-|----` (some hits, some rests)
- Snare: `----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o` (variety of hits)
- Hi-hat: `----|----|----|----` (no hits, so can add forward-looking hi-hat for rhythm)
- Toms: `----|----|----|----` (no hits)

To keep the rhythm lively and interesting, I will add a steady hi-hat pattern on every eighth note, using `x`. This will give a consistent pulse.

Here's the plan:

- Keep the kick and snare pattern as is.
- Add hi-hat (`x`) on every eighth note for a regular rhythm.
- Keep toms silent for simplicity or add selective hits for flavor.

Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Thus, the final version maintains a solid rhythmic foundation with kick, snare, and hi-hat, with no ride or cymbal.
