Let's analyze the current groove to address the request.

### Original groove:
- K (Kick): O---|O---|----|O---  
- S (Snare): ----|----|O---|----  
- H (Hi-hat): ----|----|----|----  
- T (Toms): O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-  
- C (Crash): ----|----|----|----  
- R (Ride): ----|----|----|----

### Snare hits:
- Measure 3, beat 1: "O---"
- Snare is on the first 16th note of measure 3, which is *not* on downbeat of measure 2 or 4 (since measures start with beat 1).

### Instruction:
- Avoid having the snare on the downbeat of 2 and 4.
- The downbeats of measures 2 and 4 correspond to the first notes in those measures.

### Observations:
- Currently, the snare hits are only on measure 3, beat 1, so already avoiding downbeats of 2 and 4.
- The pattern is fine as is with respect to the instruction because:
  - Measure 2: no snare hits.
  - Measure 4: no snare hits.
  - Only measure 3: snare hit on beat 1.

### Final decision:
- Since there are no snares on the downbeats of measures 2 and 4, the pattern already satisfies the condition.
- To reinforce or clarify, I can keep the pattern unchanged.
