**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits at first (`O--O`) and third (`--O-`)
  - Snare (S): hits on second beat (`Oo-o`) and last (`O--o`)
  - Hi-hat (H): silent
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): hits on every subdivision with alternating open and closed hits

- Request:
  - Add a snare hit and a ride hit in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Place a snare hit (`O`) at the first subdivision of S
  - Place a ride hit (`O`) at the first subdivision of R

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: O---|Oo-o|--o-|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

**The groove now includes a snare and a ride hit at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.**
