Let's analyze the original groove:

- The kick (K) plays on beats 1 and 3 with O (hard hits).
- The snare (S) plays on beats 2 and 4 with O.
- Hi-hat (H): plays all four beats with X (hard closed hi-hat).
- Toms (T), Cymbals (C), Ride (R): no hits.

**Request:** no cymbal or snare.

This means:

- Remove the snare (S) and cymbal (C) lines.
- Keep the kick (K) pattern.
- Keep the hi-hat (H) pattern for maintaining rhythm.
- The Toms and Ride lines are already empty, so no change needed there.

### Final plan:

- Keep the kick pattern as given.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern.
- Remove snare and cymbals.

### Final groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: (removed)
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This results in a simple, rhythmic groove with bass drum on beats 1 and 3, supported by hi-hat, fulfilling the requirement for no snare and cymbal.
