Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays on beats 1 ("O--O") and 3 ("--O-").
- **Snare (S):** plays on beat 2 ("Oo-o") and beat 4 ("O--o"), with some ghost notes ("o" and "x" for softer hits).
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent pattern with "X-x-" throughout.
- **Toms, Cymbals, Ride:** silent.

### Objective:
- To add more snare activity or variation for more rhythmical interest.
- Retain the current kick pattern.
- Keep the hi-hat steady.

### Approach:
- Keep the existing kick pattern.
- Reinforce snare on beat 1 or 3, possibly adding a ghost snare on beat 1 for extra groove.
- Keep snare hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Slightly modify snare pattern for balance.

---

### Final plan:
- Add a snare hit on beat 1 ("-O--" or "-X--") to introduce drive.
- Keep the existing snare hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Maintain hi-hat pattern.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**  
- Snare is now also on beat 1 ("-O--"), balancing the groove and adding rhythmic fullness.
- The existing snare pattern on beats 2 and 4 remains intact.
- The overall groove feels more energized with the added snare.
