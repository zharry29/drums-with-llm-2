The original groove contains no snare (S) or ride (R), so no changes are needed to remove those parts. However, to clarify, I will keep only the non-cymbal and non-snare instruments: kick, hi-hat, and toms.

Currently, the groove is:
- K: ----|----|----|----
- S: ----|----|----|----
- H: ----|x---|----|x---
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: ----|----|----|----
- R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Since the request was to remove snare and ride, and they are already absent, I will keep only the relevant lines.

Final step:
- Keep only K, H, and T lines.
- The C (crash) and R (ride) are already blank, so I can remove or keep for clarity.

Here's the cleaned version with only K, H, and T:

K: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----

This fulfills the request: no snare and no ride, and the focus is on kick and hi-hat.
