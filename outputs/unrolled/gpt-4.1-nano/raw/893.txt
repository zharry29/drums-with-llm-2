Let's analyze the original groove:

- The current pattern has many notes, especially with kick ("-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-") and hi-hat ("x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-"), which creates a dense pattern.

Since the goal is to have no more than 8 notes *total* in the entire bar, I need to drastically simplify the pattern:

- Limit the number of hits for each instrument.
- Focus on essential rhythmic accents.

**Ideal plan:**

- Use only a few essential hits—perhaps 2-4 total.
- Place some hits on the most rhythmic/important beats: beats 1 and 3 with kick and snare, hi-hat on downbeats, and optional cymbal hits for flair.

### Step-by-step:

- **Kick (K):** Choose 2 hits, for simplicity maybe on beat 1 and beat 3.
- **Snare (S):** Place 1 or 2 snare hits, possibly on beat 2 or 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** Keep 2 notes—on the downbeats.
- **Crash or ride:** Optional, maybe just one cymbal hit.

---

### Example:

- Kick: on first beat only.
- Snare: on third beat.
- Hi-hat: on the first and third beats.
- Crash: on the first beat.

Total notes: 5, well within 8.

### Final pattern:

K: O---|----|----|----
S: ----|----|--O-|----
H: x---|----|x---|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

- Kick on beat 1.
- Snare on beat 3.
- Hi-hat on beats 1 and 3.
- Crash cymbal at the start.
- Total notes: 2 (kick) + 1 (snare) + 2 (hi-hat) + 1 (crash) = 6 notes, fitting the limit.

**Final answer:**

K: O---|----|----|----
S: ----|----|--O-|----
H: x---|----|x---|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This is simple, within limit, and still a complete rhythmic idea.
