**Thought process:**

- The original groove has:
  - Kick (K): `O---|----|O---|----` — kick is played in the first and third beats.
  - Snare (S): `----|O---|----|O---` — snare is played on beat 2 and 4.
- The request is for a snare AND a kick in the very beginning.
- So, in the first beat:
  - Change snare (S) from `----` to `O---`
  - The kick (K) already has `O---` in the first beat, so no change needed there.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: O---|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**
- The first beat has both a kick and snare, fulfilling the requirement.
