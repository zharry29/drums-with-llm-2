To fulfill the request, I will add a cymbal hit and a kick at the very beginning.

Original first beat:
- K: O--O (kick hits on the 1st and 4th 16th notes)
- S: ---- (no snare)
- H: ---- (no hi-hat)
- T: ---- (no toms)
- C: ---- (no cymbal)
- R: o-O- (ride cymbal hits on the 1st and 3rd 16th notes)

**Step 1:** Add a cymbal hit: change C: ---- to C: O---

**Step 2:** The kick (O--O) is already present in the first beat, so no change needed.

Here's the edited groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

This version now includes a cymbal hit (O---) at the very beginning along with the existing kick.
