Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): `----|----|----|----` — all silent, so nothing to remove here.
- Snare (S): `----|----|----|----` — all silent, as above.
- Hi-hat (H): `----|x---|----|x---` — hi-hat hits on second and fourth beats at the first 16th note.
- Toms (T): `----|----|----|----` — silent.
- Ride (R): `x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-` — ride cymbal hits in each beat.

Since "nothing is happening" on the kick and snare, and the request was to ensure **no kick on beat 4**—which is already empty—I suspect the focus might be on the kick, or perhaps on removing any kick in the last beat if it arises later.

But as per the current groove, no kicks are present. So, I'm assuming perhaps the initial example in the prompt was different, or perhaps the goal is to confirm the pattern remains the same with no kick on beat 4.

**Given that, the only action here is that kicks should be silent on beat 4.** Since they are already silent, the groove doesn't require changes.

**Final output:**

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**This already satisfies the condition of no kick on beat 4.**
