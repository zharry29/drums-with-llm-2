Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** uses kicks (“-O--”, “OO--”, etc.) to emphasize the downbeat and some off-beats.
- **Snare (S):** only on the third beat in measure 3.
- **Hi-hat (H):** pattern with x-x- on all beats, giving a steady consistent pulse.
- **Toms (T):** only on beat 3 in measure 3.
- **Crash (C):** hits on every beat, giving a constant accent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add ride cymbal hits along with the existing hi-hat pattern, ideally complementing the groove and enhancing the rhythmic support, especially on beats 2 and 4.

### Approach:
- Introduce ride hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern for texture and continuity.
- Maintain the bass drum pattern for rhythm foundation.
- Keep crash hits to preserve emphasis.

### Implementation:
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4 in the ride line.
- Retain the other instrument patterns for a balanced mix.

### Final groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: --O-|--O-|----|--O-

```

**Summary:**  
- Ride cymbal hits ("O---") added on beats 2 and 4 in the ride line.  
- Hi-hat pattern remains for rhythmic texture.  
- The groove now features both crash and ride cymbals supporting the main pulse, making it sound more complete and dynamic.
