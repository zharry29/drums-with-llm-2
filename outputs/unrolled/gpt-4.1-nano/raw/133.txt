Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** soft hits ("o") on beats 1 and 3 in measures 1, 2, and 4.
- **Snare (S):** hits on measure 2 beat 1 ("X") and measure 3 beat 3 ("X").
- **Hi-hat (H):** hits on measure 2 beat 4 ("x") and measure 4 beat 4 ("x").
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** pattern with mixed open and closed hits pattern ("x-X-") in measures 1, 2, 3, and 4, but not explicitly labeled as ride.

### Goal:
Add **ride cymbal** and **toms** to this groove to balance the rhythm and texture.

---

### Approach:
- **Add ride hits ("X" or "O")** on beats 2 and 4 in measures 2 and 4 for the ride cymbal.
- **Add toms ("O")** on measure 3 beat 4 to introduce tom flavor.
- Keep existing parts for continuity.

---

### Implementation:

- In measure 2, beat 4 ("X-x-") can be modified or extended to include a ride hit.
- In measure 4, beat 2 could have a ride hit.
- Add a tom hit ("--O-") on measure 3, beat 4.

---

### Final groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-

H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|--O-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

```

### Explanation:
- Ride cymbal ("X") added in measure 2 beat 4 and measure 4 beat 2.
- Tom hit ("--O-") added in measure 4 beat 4.
- The groove now has both **ride** cymbal and **toms**, enriching the pattern while respecting the original structure.
