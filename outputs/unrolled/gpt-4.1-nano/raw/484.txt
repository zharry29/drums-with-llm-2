The request is to remove all kick (K) and hi-hat (H) parts. So, I will delete those lines entirely.

In the original groove:
- K: has no hits (all dashes).
- H: plays x on beat 2 and beat 4, with soft open hits X and x.
- S, T, C, R: No hits.

Since K is already silent, I only need to remove the hi-hat (H) line. The remaining instruments are S, T, C, R, which are all silent here, but R has some hits.

To keep some rhythmic feel on the remaining instruments, I can:
- Keep the ride cymbal (R), which has hits on beats 1, 2, 3, 4 with open and closed hits.
- Keep snare (S) or other parts for rhythm, but they are silent in the original.

For simplicity, I propose:
- Remove K and H lines.
- Keep R with its hits, since it defines a basic rhythm.
- All other instruments can be silent.

### Final pattern:

@@@
K: (removed)
S: ----|----|----|----
H: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

This keeps a clear rhythmic pulse with the ride cymbal.
