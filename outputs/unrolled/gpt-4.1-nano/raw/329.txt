Let's examine the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays on beats 1 ("-O--"), 2 ("OO--"), 3 ("---O"), and 4 ("-OO-")
- **Snare (S):** plays on beat 3 ("S---")
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays consistent closed hits on all beats ("x-x-", "x-x-", etc.)
- **Toms (T):** only on beat 3 ("---O")
- **Cymbals (C):** plays on beats 1 and 2 ("O---", "O---")
- **Ride (R):** silent

### New instructions:
- Remove snare (S) and ride cymbal (R).

### Approach:
- Erase S and R lines.
- Keep the kick pattern, perhaps emphasizing rhythm if desired.
- Maintain hi-hat to keep the pulse.

### Final decision:
- Keep the existing kick pattern as it has some variation, or simplify it.
- Keep hi-hat pattern.
- No snare or ride.

### Final groove:

This gives a clean, rhythmically interesting groove with emphasis on kick and steady hi-hat, matching your request.
