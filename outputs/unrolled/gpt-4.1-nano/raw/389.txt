Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': no hits, already silent.
- Snare 'S': no hits.
- Hi-hat 'H': plays on beat 2 and 4 with soft closed hits ('x').
- Toms 'T': no hits.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': 'R' (ride) has hits on beats 1 and 3, with open and closed hits.

**Request:** Remove snare 'S' and hi-hat 'H'.

- Change 'S' and 'H' lines to all dashes ('-').

Remaining instruments are cymbals 'C' and 'R'.

This includes only the cymbal pattern, with no snare or hi-hat, matching the requested edits.
