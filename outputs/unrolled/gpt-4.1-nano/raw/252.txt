Let's analyze the current groove first:

- **Kick (K):** plays on beats 1 ("OOO-"), 2 ("--O-"), 3 ("OOO-"), 4 ("-OOO")
- **Snare (S):** plays on beat 2 ("O---") and beat 4 ("O---")
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Crash (C):** plays on all four beats ("O---")
- **Ride (R):** silent

---

### Goal:
Add the ride cymbal to this pattern so that it complements the existing cymbals and overall groove.

### Approach:
- Introduce ride hits on beats 2 and 4, which is common in many styles, to create a backbeat feel.
- Ensure that the ride pattern fits rhythmically with the existing pattern.

---

### Implementation:
- Add ride (R) hits as "O---" on beat 2 and beat 4, aligning with snare hits, for a typical groove.

---

### Final groove:

**Summary:**
- Ride cymbal hits added on beats 2 and 4 ("--O-") to support the snare and provide a consistent ride sound.
- Maintains the original kick and cymbal pattern for a balanced drum groove.
