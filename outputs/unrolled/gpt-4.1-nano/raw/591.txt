The current groove includes no snare (S) or ride cymbal (R). To fulfill the instruction of removing snare and ride, I will delete the S and R lines entirely.

Remaining:
- K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
- H: ----|x---|----|x---
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: ----|----|----|----

Now, I will keep a simple, rhythmically interesting pattern with the remaining instruments, emphasizing the kick and hi-hat, which are already active.

Final groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----

This version removes the snare and ride as requested, and maintains a consistent rhythm with kick and hi-hat.
