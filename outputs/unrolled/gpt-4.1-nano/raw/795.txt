**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits at the start (`O--O`) and third beat (`--O-`)
  - Snare (S): hits on second and last beats, with some open hits (`Oo-o`, `O--o`)
  - Hi-hat (H): silent
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): pattern alternating on bell and bow

- Requested edits:
  - Add a tom hit and a ride in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - Add a tom hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in T.
  - Add a ride hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in R.
