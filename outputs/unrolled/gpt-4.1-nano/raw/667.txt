**Thought process:**

- To add a ride hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of R from `----` to `O---` (a typical ride hit).
- To add a kick in the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `O---` to `O---` (already a kick hit). To make it explicit, I will retain the kick hit and add the ride hit.

**Implementation:**

- K: remains `O---` 
- R: change first beat from `----` to `O---`

Other instruments stay the same.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

This provides a ride hit and kick in the very beginning, as requested.
