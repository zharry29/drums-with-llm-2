**Thought process:**

- The original groove has no snare or hi-hat hits at the start.
- To fulfill the request for a snare and hi-hat in the very beginning:
  - I will add a snare hit (`O---`) in the first beat of S.
  - I will ensure there is a hi-hat hit (`x---`) in the first beat of H if not already present.
- Currently, H is `----` in the first beat, so I will change that to `x---`.
- For S, change from `----` to `O---`.

This way, the first beat will have both a snare and a hi-hat hit.

**Summary:**  
Both a snare and hi-hat hit are present in the very first beat.
