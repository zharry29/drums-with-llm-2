To fulfill the request:

- Play **closed hi-hat** (`x` for soft, `X` for loud/strong) on **all 16th notes**.
- Make the **quarter note down beats** (beats 1, 2, 3, 4), which are the first notes of each beat (positions 1, 5, 9, 13), **accented** with a louder hit (`X`) for emphasis.

So, for each beat:
- The first note (downbeat) will be `X`.
- The remaining three notes in each beat will be `x` for consistency, with the downbeat being more accented.

### Updated hi-hat line:
`Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx`

---

### Final edited groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-

H: Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

```

This pattern plays a continuous, accented closed hi-hat on all 16th notes, emphasizing the down beats for a strong rhythmic feel.
