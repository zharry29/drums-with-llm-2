**Thought process:**
- To add a snare hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of S from `----` to `S---`.
- To add a cymbal at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---` (already a cymbal hit).

Since the cymbal is already present at the start (O---), only the snare needs to be added with a `S---`.

---

**Implementation:**

- S: `S---` (new snare hit at start)
- C: remains `O---`

---

**Final groove:**

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: S---|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This adds a snare hit in the very beginning, keeping the cymbal already in place.
