To add a tom hit and cymbal in the very beginning, I will focus on the first beat (the first 4 characters in each line) and make the appropriate changes:

Original first beat:
- K: O---
- S: ----
- H: ----
- T: O-o-
- C: ----
- R: ----

**Plan:**
- Add a tom hit: T: O---
- Add a cymbal: C: O---

The cymbal is already silent in the first beat, but it's okay to explicitly set it.

**Final changes:**
- Set T: O---
- Set C: O---

The rest remain unchanged.

**Updated groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds a tom hit and cymbal hit at the beginning as requested.
