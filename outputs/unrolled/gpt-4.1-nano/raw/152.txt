Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on measures 1, 2, and 4, with soft hits ("O---") or "O---" on beat 1, 2, and 4.
- **Snare (S):** only in measure 3 ("O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** pattern is alternating soft hits on beats 1, 2, 3, 4 ("O-o-").
- **Cymbals (C, R):** silent.

### Goal:
- Add a snare to make the groove more rhythmic, as it currently only has a snare on measure 3.
- Add hi-hat (currently silent) to provide rhythm support.

### Approach:
- Keep existing kick and tom pattern.
- Add snare on beats 2 and 4 for a typical backbeat.
- Add hi-hat pattern throughout (e.g., steady "x---" or "X---") to drive the rhythm.

### Implementation:
- Snare in measure 2 beat 3 ("--S-") and measure 4 beat 2 ("--S-").
- Hi-hat steady "x---" pattern across measures.
- Keep the pattern simple and rhythmic.

### Final groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|--S-|----|--S-
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

**Explanation:**
- Snare added in measure 2 and 4 for a stronger backbeat.
- Hi-hat now active with steady "x---" pattern to sustain rhythm.
- Kick remains as existing, providing the foundation.
- Toms provide rhythmic variation, supporting overall groove.

This pattern ensures the groove includes both snare and hi-hat, making it more rhythmically complete.
