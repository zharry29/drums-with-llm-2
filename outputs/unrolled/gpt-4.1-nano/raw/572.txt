The instruction is to remove the kick (K) and snare (S) lines.

- K: `O---|O---|----|O---` (remove)
- S: `----|----|O---|----` (remove)

Remaining instruments:
- H: `----|----|----|----`
- T: `O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`
- C: `----|----|----|----`
- R: `----|----|----|----`

To keep the groove interesting without kick or snare, I will add a pattern using the hi-hat and possibly the ride cymbal, along with the toms for accents.

Here's a suggested pattern:
- Keep the toms (T) pattern as is, since it provides rhythm
- Add steady closed hi-hat hits (x) on every eighth note for consistent rhythm
- Add a soft ride cymbal hit on the 2nd beat for variation

Final groove:

H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|--O-|----|--O-

This creates a lively but closed percussion pattern without kick or snare.
