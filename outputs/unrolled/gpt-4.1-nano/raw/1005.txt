Let's analyze and plan the hi-hat part:

**Current pattern:**
`----|x---|----|x---`
- No hi-hat on most notes.
- The pattern involves soft open (`x`) hits at specific spots.

**Instructions:**
- Play **closed hi-hat (`X`)** on **all 8th notes** (positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16).
- Open (`O`) on **every up beat** â€” these are the off-beats following downbeats, i.e., notes 2, 6, 10, 14.
- Keep hits **hard**.
- Use `X` for closed hits (hard), `O` for open hits (hard).

### Strategy:
- For **all 8th notes**: use `X` in the general case.
- On the **up beats** (2, 6, 10, 14), switch to `O` to get open hi-hat.

### Pattern:
- 2: open `O`
- 4: closed `X`
- 6: open `O`
- 8: closed `X`
- 10: open `O`
- 12: closed `X`
- 14: open `O`
- 16: closed `X`

### Final notation:
`-X--|-O--|-X--|-O--`

### Final drum groove:

This pattern satisfies the requirements: **closed hi-hat on all 8th notes**, **open on every up beat**, **hits are hard**.
