**Thought process:**

- To add a snare hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of S from `----` to `S---`.
- To add a cymbal at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `O---` to `O---` (already cymbal hit).

Since the cymbal is already played at the start with `O---`, I only need to add the snare to the first beat.

**Implementation:**

- S: `S---` (adding snare hit at start)
- C: remains `O---`

---

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: S---|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This now features a snare hit and maintains the cymbal in the very beginning, per the request.
