Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K' is playing on beats 1, 3, and 4 with various intensities.
- Snare 'S' has hits on beats 2 and 4 with a mix of open and closed hits ('O', 'o', 'X').
- Hi-hat 'H' is silent.
- Toms 'T' are silent.
- Cymbals 'C' are silent.
- Ride 'R' plays on all four beats with alternating open and closed hits ('o' and 'O').

**Request:** Remove snare 'S' and hi-hat 'H'.

- Replace 'S' and 'H' lines with all dashes ('-').

The remaining parts are kick, cymbals, and ride.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

This leaves only kick, cymbals, and ride, which satisfies the request to remove snare and hi-hat.
