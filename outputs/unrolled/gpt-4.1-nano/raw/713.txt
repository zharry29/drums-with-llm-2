**Thought process:**

- The request is to add a hi-hat hit and a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning.
- The hi-hat (H) is currently all `----`, so I will add a hi-hat hit at the first 16th note, changing the first beat of H from `----` to `x---`.
- The ride cymbal (R) in the first beat is `o-O-`, which already has a hit in the third 16th note. To add an emphasis or a new hit at the beginning (first 16th note), I will change the first beat of R from `o-O-` to `X-O-`, indicating a hard closed ride cymbal hit on the first 16th note.
- The rest of the groove remains unchanged.

**Final plan:**

- K: remains `O--O|----|--O-|----`
- S: remains `----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o`
- H: change from `----` to `x---`
- T: remains `----|----|----|----`
- C: remains `----|----|----|----`
- R: change from `o-O-` to `X-O-`

This includes a hi-hat hit and a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
