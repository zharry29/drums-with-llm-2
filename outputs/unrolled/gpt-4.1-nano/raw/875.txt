Let's analyze the current groove.

Original groove:
K: O--O|----|--O-|----  
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o  
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

The snare hits are on:
- Measure 2: "Oo-o" on beat 2
- Measure 3: "-o--" on beat 3
- Measure 4: "O--o" on beat 4

The user wants to avoid the snare on the downbeat (first 16th note) of beats 2 and 4—that is, the first note of measure 2 and measure 4.

Currently:
- Measure 2: 'O' is on the first beat (downbeat)—this needs to be moved or removed.
- Measure 3: the snare is on beat 3, which is okay.
- Measure 4: snare on beat 4's first note ('O')—we should move or remove.

To comply:
- Remove snare hits on beat 2 and beat 4 downbeats.
- Keep rest or offbeat snare hits in those sections to preserve rhythm or add variation.

Approach:
- For measure 2, change "Oo-o" to have no snare on the first note; perhaps " --o-" or similar.
- For measure 4, change "O--o" to '--o-' or similar.

Here's my plan:
- Measure 2: "----" (no snare)
- Measure 3: keep as is ("-o--")
- Measure 4: "--o-" (snare on offbeat, not on beat 1)

The rest of the groove I keep the same to preserve the feel.

Note: maintaining the pattern of snare hits off the downbeats on measure 2 and 4, and preserving other instruments' rhythms.
