Let's analyze the current groove:

- K (Kick): OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
- S (Snare): ----|O---|----|O---
- H (Hi-hat): ----|----|----|----
- T (Toms): ----|----|----|----
- C (Crash): O---|O---|O---|O---
- R (Ride): ----|----|----|----

### Observations:
- The snare is only on beat 2 and beat 4 (second and fourth measure).
- The crash cymbal is playing on the first and second beats of each measure.
- The ride cymbal is absent.

### Goals:
- Add a ride cymbal pattern for more rhythmic interest.
- Reinforce or add to the snare hits, possibly on the first and third beats.
- Preserve existing crash cymbal hits.

---

### Approach:
- Place ride cymbal hits 'R' on notes 1 and 9 for a swing/even ride pattern.
- Add snare 'S' on notes 1-4 (beat 1) and 9-12 (beat 3) to create a more driving rhythm.
- Keep the hi-hats as they are for subtle backing.

---

### Final pattern:
- Snare: on beats 1 and 3.
- Ride: on beats 1 and 3.
- Crash cymbals as existing.

---

### Result:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: S---|----|S---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: R---|R---|R---|R---

**Note:**  
- S (snare) added on beat 1 and 3 (notes 1-4 and 9-12) for increased rhythmic energy.
- R (ride cymbal) hits on notes 1 and 9 to reinforce the rhythm.
- Crash cymbals still present for accents.

This creates a balanced, energetic groove with both cymbals and snare.
