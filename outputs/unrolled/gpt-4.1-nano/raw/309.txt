Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** active in all four beats with various intensities.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 ("O---" and "O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash cymbal (C):** hits on every beat ("O---").
- **Ride cymbal (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Introduce more cymbal activity and ensure there's a prominent cymbal pattern along with the snare. Since crash cymbals are already on every beat, and ride cymbal is currently silent, let's add some ride cymbal hits to complement the crashes and keep the groove lively.

### Thought process:

- Keep the crash cymbal pattern (C) as is, since it emphasizes beats 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Add **ride cymbal (R)** hits on every beat for a steady ride pattern.
- Keep the snare on beats 2 and 4 for backbeat.
- To make it dynamic, we can add some ghost hi-hat notes to keep the texture.

### Final plan:

- Insert "O---" in **R** for every beat.
- Maintain the existing crash hits.
- Keep snare on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep ghost notes on hi-hat for subtlety.

### Final edited groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|--O-|----|--O-
H: ----|x---|----|x---
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

```

**Result:**
- The ride cymbal now supports the beat on every measure, creating a consistent pattern.
- The crash cymbal maintains emphasis on all beats.
- Snare hits on beats 2 and 4 enhance the backbeat.
- The hi-hat ghost notes add subtle texture.

This creates a fuller, more energetic rhythmic foundation with both cymbals and snare active.
