**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `----` to `O---` (a hard kick).
- To add a hi-hat hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of H from `----` to `x---` (a soft closed hi-hat).
- Keep other parts unchanged.

**Implementation:**

- K: from `----` to `O---`
- H: from `----` to `x---`

---

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: x---|----|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

The first beat now has both a kick and a hi-hat, as requested.
