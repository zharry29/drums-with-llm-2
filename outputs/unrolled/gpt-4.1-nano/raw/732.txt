**Thought process:**
- The original groove has no snare (S) or hi-hat (H) hits at the very start.
- To meet the request, I will add a snare hit and a hi-hat hit in the first beat.
- For the snare, I will set the first beat (first 4 characters of S) from `----` to `O---` (a strong snare hit).
- For the hi-hat, I will set the first beat (first 4 characters of H) from `x-x-` to `x-x-` with a hit at the start, but since it's already `x-x-`, I will just ensure there's a hit in the first beat. To be clear, I will keep the hi-hat pattern as is or modify the first beat to `x-x-` if necessary.

**Implementation:**
- Change S line first beat to `O---`.
- Keep H line as `x-x-` because it already contains hi-hat hits.

**Final groove:**

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: O---|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:** The snare and hi-hat are now both hit at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
