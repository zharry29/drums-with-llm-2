**Thought process:**

- To add a cymbal hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---` (Crash cymbal).
- To add a tom in the very beginning, change the first beat of T from `----` to `O---` (Tom hit).
- Place both on the first beat to occur simultaneously.

**Implementation:**

- T: from `----` to `O---`
- C: from `----` to `O---`

---

**Final edited groove:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Now, both a cymbal hit and a tom happen at the very beginning, as requested.
