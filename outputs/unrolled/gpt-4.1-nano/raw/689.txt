**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `O--O` to `O--O` â€” it's already a hit, so no change needed.
- To add a snare hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of S from `----` to, for example, `--O-` or `--X-`. I'll choose `--X-` to keep the snare sharp and consistent.
- Keep other parts unchanged.

**Implementation:**

- K remains `O--O`
- S: from `----` to `--X-`

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: --X-|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Result:** The first beat now includes a kick and a snare, fulfilling the request.
