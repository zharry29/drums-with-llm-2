Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-  
  - Kick hits on different beats with varying intensity.
- Snare 'S': ----|----|S---|----  
  - Snare only hits in measure 3, beat 1.
- Hi-hat 'H': x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-  
  - Continuous hi-hat pattern on every beat.
- Toms 'T': ----|----|---O|----  
  - Tom hit only in measure 3, beat 4.
- Cymbals 'C' and Ride 'R': 'C' has hits on beats 1, 2, and 3 per measure; 'R' has no hits.

**Request:** Remove hi-hat 'H' and toms 'T'.  
- That means delete 'H' and 'T' lines and their notes.

### Plan:
- Keep the kick 'K' pattern.
- Keep the snare 'S' hits, especially on measure 3, beat 1.
- Keep the cymbal 'C' hits for rhythm.
- Remove 'H' and 'T'.

### Final pattern:
- Focus on kick, snare, and cymbals only.
