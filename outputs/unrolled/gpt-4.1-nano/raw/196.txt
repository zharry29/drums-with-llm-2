Let's analyze the existing groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 ("O--O"), 3 ("--O-")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 with ghost notes ("Oo-o") and beat 4 with "O--o"
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** hits on every beat with alternating open and closed sounds ("o-O-").

### Goal:
Add **tom** and **more prominent snare** (or reinforce the existing snare) to make the groove richer.

### Approach:
- Add **tom** on beat 3 or 4. Since beat 3 has kick, perhaps add tom on beat 4 for variety.
- Keep the snare pattern but reinforce with additional hits if desired.

### Implementation:
- Add **tom** on beat 4: "-O--"
- Reinforce snare hits on beat 2 and 4 for a fuller backbeat.

**Explanation:**
- Tom added on beat 4 ("--O-") for rhythmic emphasis.
- Snare reinforced on beat 4 ("O--o").
- Keep the existing ghost notes and ride pattern.
- Overall, the groove becomes more lively with added tom and snare accents while keeping the original feel intact.
