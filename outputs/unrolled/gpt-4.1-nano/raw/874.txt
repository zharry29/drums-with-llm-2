Let's analyze the current groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
S: ----|X---|--X-|----  
H: ----|x---|----|x---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-  

The snare (S) is on the second 16th note of measure 2 (X---) and measure 3 (X---). The user wants to avoid having the snare on the downbeat of measures 2 and 4, which corresponds to the first note of each measure.

Currently:
- Measure 2: the snare is on the 5th note (X---), i.e., off the downbeat, so it’s fine.
- Measure 3: the snare is on the 5th note as well, off the downbeat.
- But looking closely, in measure 2 and measure 3, the snares are placed on the beats 2 and 3, not on the downbeat (beat 1). 

The issue is primarily with measure 4 if any. But measure 4’s snare is missing, so no problem there.

The main focus:
- Ensure there is no snare on beat 1 of measures 2 and 4 (the downbeat).

In the original, snare hits are already placed on offbeats (beats 2 and 3). Therefore, no adjustment needed.

But to be thorough, suppose the snare was on the downbeat (first note of each measure). The instructions aim to avoid snare hits on beats 1 and 3 (downbeat of 2 and 4), so if present, they should be moved.

In this existing groove, the snare is only on second and third beats: no change needed unless we want to reinforce the pattern and make sure no snare hits are on the downbeat.

**Final plan:**
- Keep snare hits off the downbeat, only on offbeats.
- Remove any snare hits from measure 4 if present on the downbeat — currently, it isn't.

**Result:**
- Keep the current pattern as it already avoids snare on downbeats of 2 and 4.

**Optional variation:** If we want to add a little variation, we could replace the snare hits on the offbeat (measure 2, beat 2) with a softer hit or remove altogether for a more sparse pattern.

Here's an alternative, slightly simplified pattern with no snare on downbeats:

@@@
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
S: ----|----|--X-|----  
H: ----|x---|----|x---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-  
@@@

This maintains the offbeat snare hits and ensures no snare is on the downbeat (beats 1 of each measure). 

**Final answer in notation:**

@@@
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|----|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

This pattern respects the instruction to avoid snare on the downbeat of measures 2 and 4.
