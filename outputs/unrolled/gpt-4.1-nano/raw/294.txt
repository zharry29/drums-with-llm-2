Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on certain beats, emphasizing the rhythm.
- **Snare (S):** only in measure 3 on beat 1, with some designations suggesting ghost notes.
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent pattern with x's, maintaining a steady pulse.
- **Toms (T):** on beat 3 of the third measure.
- **Crash (C):** hits on all beats in measures 1-3.
- **Ride (R):** silent; needs to support the rhythm.

**Objective:**  
Add a ride cymbal pattern to complement the hi-hat, creating a fuller cymbal texture.

### Approach:
- Introduce a straightforward ride pattern: "O---" on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Combine with the existing hi-hat pattern.
- Keep the existing instruments as is for rhythmic clarity.

---

### Final plan:
- Add "O---" in the R line on all four beats.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern to sustain rhythm.

### Final groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

```

**Summary:**  
- The ride cymbal ("O---") now plays on all four beats.
- The hi-hat continues its steady pattern.
- This creates a fuller, more balanced cymbal layer supporting the existing groove.
