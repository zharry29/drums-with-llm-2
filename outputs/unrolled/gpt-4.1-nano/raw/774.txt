**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O---|O---|----|O---` (hits on the first, second, and last beats)
  - Snare (S): `----|----|O---|----` (snare on beat 3)
  - Hi-hat (H): `----|----|----|----` (silent)
  - Toms (T): `O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-` (hi-hat pattern on all beats)
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): silent

- Request:
  - Add a ride hit and cymbal in the very beginning.

- The first beat currently:
  - Kick: `O---`
  - No ride or cymbal.

- To fulfill the request:
  - Add a ride hit in the first beat, e.g., `O---` in R line.
  - Add cymbal (likely C crash) in the first beat, e.g., `O---` in C line.

**Note:** The ride is not in the original, but as per the notation conventions, I will use the R line for ride and C line for crash cymbal.

**Final edited groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

This includes:
- A ride hit (`O`) in the first beat on the R line.
- A cymbal crash (`O`) in the first beat on the C line.

This should meet the request to have a ride hit and a cymbal in the very beginning.
