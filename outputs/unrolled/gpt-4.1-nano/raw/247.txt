Let's analyze the original groove first:

- **Kick (K):** silent all through
- **Snare (S):** silent all through
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes on beat 2 ("x---") and beat 4 ("x---")
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** pattern with closed and open hits, mainly on beat 1 and beat 3

### Objective:
Add toms (T) into this groove, which currently has none, for rhythmic fills or accents.

### Approach:
- Place a tom hit (e.g., "-O--") on beat 3 to create a punch.
- Place a tom hit (e.g., "---O") on beat 4 to add fill variation.
- Keep hi-hat ghost notes and cymbal pattern intact.

### Final plan:
- Add tom hits on beats 3 and 4.

**Summary:**
- Toms are now played on beats 3 ("--O-") and 4 ("---O") to add fills.
- The groove maintains the existing ghost notes and cymbal pattern for rhythm coherence.
