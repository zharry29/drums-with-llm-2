Let's analyze the current groove:

- **K (Kick):** `----|----|----|----` — no kick.
- **S (Snare):** `----|----|----|----` — no snare.
- **H (Hi-hat):** `----|x---|----|x---` — hi-hat on beats 2 and 4 at the 2nd sixteenth note.
- **T (Toms):** `----|----|----|----` — no tom.
- **C (Crash):** `----|----|----|----` — no crash.
- **R (Ride):** `x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-` — ride pattern, no tom hits at all.

**The request** is about the toms: "I don't want tom on beat 4 but everything else is fine."

- Currently, there are no toms, so it's already compliant with the requirement that no tom hits occur on beat 4.

**Conclusion:** Since there are no tom hits at all, nothing needs to be changed.

### Final edit:  
The original groove already has no toms on beat 4, so I will leave it unchanged.
