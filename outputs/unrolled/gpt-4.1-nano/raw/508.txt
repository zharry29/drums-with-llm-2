The instructions are to remove all cymbals (C and R) and toms (T).  
- The T line: `----|----|----|----` — remove it.  
- The R line: `----|----|----|----` — remove it.  
- The C line: `O---|----|----|----` — remove it.

Remaining instruments:
- K (kick): `O---|---o|O-O-|----` (keeps the hits)
- S (snare): `----|O---|----|O---` (keeps the hits)
- H (hi-hat): `--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-` (which is already playing, keep as is or modify slightly)

Since hi-hat is playing, and kick and snare are active, I will simply present the cleaned-up groove with the same pattern:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

This version removes all cymbals and toms, maintains rhythm, and ensures the groove remains complete.
