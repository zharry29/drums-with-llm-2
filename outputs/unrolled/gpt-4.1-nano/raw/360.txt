Let's analyze the original groove:
- Kick 'K' plays on beats 1 and 3.
- Snare 'S' plays on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat 'H' maintains a consistent pattern across all beats.
- Cymbal 'C' and Ride 'R' are silent.

**Request:** Remove all cymbal and ride parts.

**Approach:**
- Remove 'C' and 'R' lines from the notation.
- Keep 'K', 'S', and 'H'.

### Final groove:

This version maintains the core rhythm with kick, snare, and hi-hat, with no cymbals or ride cymbals, matching the request.
