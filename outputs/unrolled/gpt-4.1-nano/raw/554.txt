The instructions are to remove all tom (T) and snare (S) lines.

- Remove the S line: `----|----|S---|----` (already silent)
- Remove the T line: `----|----|---O|----` (will be removed)

Remaining instruments:
- K: `-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-`
- H: `x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-`
- C: `O---|O---|O---|O---`
- R: `----|----|----|----` (silent)

The only active lines are K, H, and C.

The final drum pattern should include just these parts. Since the task is to keep only necessary, active instruments, hereâ€™s the cleaned version:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---

This satisfies the request: all snare and tom lines are removed, leaving only kick, hi-hat, and cymbal.
