To incorporate a tom hit and cymbal in the very beginning, I will focus on the first beat (the first 4 characters in each line).

Original first beat:
- K: o---
- S: ----
- H: ----
- T: ----
- C: ----
- R: x---

**Approach:**
- Add a tom hit: T: O--- (a hard tom hit in the first 16th note)
- Add a cymbal: C: O--- (a crash cymbal in the first beat)

Since the cymbal is already silent in the first beat, I will now set C: O---. 

The rest can stay as they are.

Final edited version:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This adds a tom hit and cymbal in the first beat, fulfilling your request while preserving the rest of the groove.
