**Thought process:**

- To incorporate a cymbal hit at the very beginning, I will add a crash cymbal (C) hit to the first beat.
- The crash cymbal hit in the first beat is currently `O---`. I will leave it as is, since it's already a cymbal hit.
- For the hi-hat, to add a hit in the very first beat, change the first beat of H from `x-x-` to `x-x-`. It already includes hits on the first and third 16th notes, so itâ€™s suitable.
- The main change needed is to emphasize or ensure the cymbal hit at the start.

**Implementation details:**

- For the cymbal: leave C first beat as `O---` (already a cymbal hit).
- For the hi-hat: the first beat is already `x-x-`, which includes hits on the first and third 16th notes.

**No change necessary for the groove itself, since the cymbal hit and hi-hat are already present at the start. However, if I want to make it more prominent, I could add extra hits or emphasize the existing ones.**

**Final version (unchanged but confirming the presence of both):**

@@@
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:** The initial hit already includes a cymbal (C) and a hi-hat in the first beat, consistent with the request. If we want extra emphasis, I could add a crash in the first beat like changing the crash cymbal from `O---` to `O---` (already present), so no change needed. The groove already fulfills the request.

**Therefore, the final answer is:**

@@@
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
