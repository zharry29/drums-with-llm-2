Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): no hits
- Snare (S): no hits
- Hi-hat (H): plays on beats 2 & 4 with soft open hi-hat
- Toms (T): no hits
- Cymbal (C): no hits
- Ride (R): plays on beats 1 and 3 with alternating open and closed hits

**Request:** no hi-hat or snare.

**Steps:**

- Remove H and S lines entirely.
- Keep K, C, R, T (though T is empty here).
- Since C is a cymbal, and R is a ride cymbal (a cymbal), remove R as well.

Remaining: none of the percussion instruments are left with hits; only K, T, C, R are used for percussion.

Since the task is to produce a new groove **without** hi-hat and snare, and the original is mostly empty, I will create a new pattern emphasizing only the kick and ride cymbal for rhythmic interest, excluding the hi-hat, snare, and cymbal.

### Final groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|----|O---|----
S: (removed)
H: (removed)

This syntheses a basic pattern with kick and ride cymbal, giving a rhythmic pulse without hi-hat or snare as per your request. Alternatively, if you'd like a more active pattern with just kick and ride, I could further modify the notes.

**Final answer:**
