Let's analyze the current groove:

- The second beat is **--o-|X---**, which are notes 5-8.
- The snare line (S) currently has **X---**, meaning:
  - Snare hits only on note 6 (position 6).

**Goal:** Place snare hits on **every 16th note in the second beat** â€” notes 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Since each beat has 4 notes, I will set the snare pattern in beat 2 to **OOOO** so that the snare hits on all four notes (5-8).

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|OOOO|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Now, the snare hits on every 16th note in the second beat, fulfilling the request, while keeping the rest of the groove intact.
