Let's analyze the existing groove:

- **Kick (K):** soft hits ("o---", "--o-", "o---", "--o-").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("X---") and beat 3 ("--X-").
- **Hi-hat (H):** soft closed hits on beats 2 and 4.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** hits on all four beats with alternating open/closed hits, adding some complexity.

**Objective:**  
Add more punch and balance by including regular kick pattern support alongside the existing pattern.

### Thought process:

- Keep the existing subtle kicks to preserve the groove's vibe.
- To strengthen the rhythm, I will add a more prominent kick on beat 1 ("o---") and beat 4 ("--o-") to match the snare beats and drive the song forward.

### Final plan:

- Keep current kicks.
- Add an additional louder kick ("O") on beat 1 and beat 4 for more emphasis.
- Maintain the snare pattern and hi-hat consistency.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**  
- Added a strong kick at beat 1 ("O---") and beat 4 ("--o-") to accentuate the rhythm.
- Preserved the original subtle kicks.
- The snare is maintained on beats 2 and 3 with the same pattern.
- Hi-hat and cymbals support the groove nicely.
