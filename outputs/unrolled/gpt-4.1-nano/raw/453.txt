Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits at the start of beat 1 and beat 3.
- Snare (S): hits on beat 2 and beat 4.
- Hi-hat (H): constant closed hits on every 16th note.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C): silent.
- Ride (R): silent.

**Request:** no cymbals or hi-hat.

**Approach:**

- Remove the H and C lines entirely.
- Keep the kick and snare lines.
- Toms and ride remain silent.

**Result:**

- The kick provides the foundation.
- The snare accents beats 2 and 4.
- No cymbals or hi-hat, creating a simple, straightforward rhythm.

This fulfills the request, keeping a clean, minimal rhythm with just kick and snare, excluding cymbals and hi-hat.
