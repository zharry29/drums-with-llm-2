Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits at first and third beats ("O--O" and "--O-").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4, with some variation between open and sidestick.
- **Hi-hat (H):** steady pattern with X and -.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### Goal:
Introduce **cymbals** along with the existing ride. 

### Approach:
- Since cymbals (C) are already silent, we'll add standard crash cymbal hits typically on beat 1 for emphasis.
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O" or "o") on beats 2 and 4 to complement the groove.
- Distribute ride hits on beats 2 and 4, possibly with a soft ("o") for subtlety.

---

### Final plan:
- Add a crash cymbal at measure 1 beat 1 ("O---").
- Add ride hits ("O") on measure 2 beat 2 ("--O-") and measure 4 beat 4 ("---O").
- Keep cymbals (C) as they are, or optionally, add a crash or cymbal hits if desired.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----

H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|--O-|----|---O

```

**Summary of changes:**
- Added a crash cymbal at sentence start in measure 1.
- Added ride hits on measure 2 (beat 2) and measure 4 (beat 4).
- Kept existing cymbals.

This creates a fuller, more dynamic pattern with both cymbals and ride.
