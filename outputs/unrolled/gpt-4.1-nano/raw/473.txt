The original groove has no kick or snare, only hi-hat, toms, and cymbals. The request is to remove all snare and kick parts, which are already empty in this groove. So, essentially, I just need to leave the pattern as is, possibly make it more interesting, or confirm that the remaining instruments are suitable.

Let's consider the remaining instruments:

- **Hi-hat (H):** plays X--- in the second beat and X--- in the fourth, with closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** silent throughout.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride cymbal (R):** plays on beats 1 and 3, with open and closed hits, giving some rhythmic content.

Since snare and kick are absent, and T and C are silent, the rhythm is mainly carried by the ride cymbal (R) and hi-hat (H).

**Final decision:** Keep the pattern as-is, since it meets the requirement (no snare or kick), and it maintains rhythmic interest with the ride cymbal and hi-hat.

This pattern contains no snare or kick, as requested, and maintains a rhythmic groove with cymbal and hi-hat activity.
