**Thought process:**

- The original groove has a hi-hat pattern `--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`, with hits on every beat.
- To fulfill the request for a hi-hat hit and a cymbal at the very beginning:
  - The hi-hat already has a hit in the first beat (`--o-`), which is a soft open hit on the third 16th note. To emphasize the initial hit, I can leave it as is or change it to a harder hit if needed.
  - For the cymbal, the original groove has no cymbal. To add one, I will set the first beat of the cymbal (C) from `O---` to `O---` (no change) or add an explicit cymbal hit at the start.
  - Since a cymbal hit in the very beginning is desired, I will set the first beat of the cymbal (C) to `O---` (crash cymbal hit).

- The existing hi-hat already has a hit at the start, so I do not need to change that unless emphasizing.

**Final plan:**

- Keep the hi-hat pattern as is.
- Change the first beat of the cymbal (C) from `O---` to `O---` (it's already `O---`, but I will explicitly include it).

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----

H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:**  
- The existing groove already features a hi-hat hit and no cymbal initially, but the hi-hat already has a hit in the first beat.  
- To explicitly add a cymbal in the first beat (and since the groove already had no cymbal), I will set the first beat of C to `O---`.  
- The overall groove remains the same with emphasis on the initial hits.

**Alternative with explicit cymbal hit:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This keeps the existing hits and confirms the cymbal hit at the beginning.
