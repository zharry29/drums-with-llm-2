Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 ("O--O") and 3 ("--O-") with soft hits.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("Oo-o") and beat 4 ("O--o"), with some softer hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** hits with alternating open and closed sounds ("o-O-", "o-O-") on all beats, giving a consistent ride pattern.

### The request:
Add a *not only* ride but also a more prominent kick drum pattern.

### Approach:
- Keep the existing kick hits, but strengthen or add additional kick hits for rhythm.
- Ensure the ride cymbal pattern stays.
- The groove should be rhythmically balanced with both elements.

### Implementation:
- Add a consistent kick on every beat (e.g., beat 2 with "O" in the K line) to reinforce rhythm.
- Keep existing kick hits on beats 1 and 3 with the same articulation.
- Keep the ride pattern as-is to support the groove.

### Final edited groove:

K: O--O|O--O|--O-|O--O
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

```

**Summary:**
- Added kick hits on beats 2 and 4 ("O--O" after the first pattern) to add rhythmic drive.
- Maintained the existing main kick hits.
- The ride pattern remains unchanged.
- The groove now combines both elements for a fuller rhythm.
