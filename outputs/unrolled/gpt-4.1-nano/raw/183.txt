Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 (all with strong hits)
- **Snare (S):** on beat 3
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent
- **Toms (T):** ghost notes on all beats ("O-o-"), which adds subtle percussion
- **Cymbals (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** silent

---

### Goal:
Add a **tom** and **ride cymbal** to enrich the groove.

### Approach:
- Add a **ride cymbal** on beat 2 ("O---" or similar for presence).
- Add a **tom** hit on beat 4 ("--O-") to complement the existing ghost notes.
- Keep the existing groove intact to maintain its rhythmic feel.

---

### Final plan:
- Place a ride cymbal on beat 2, possibly integrating it with the existing notes.
- Add a tom hit on beat 4 ("--O-") for more texture.
- Keep ghost notes on hi-hat to preserve subtlety.

### Final groove:

**What was done?**
- Ride cymbal added on beat 2 ("O---").
- Tom hit added on beat 4 ("--O-").
- Rest patterns preserved to maintain original feel.

This adds a ride and a tom seamlessly into the groove.
