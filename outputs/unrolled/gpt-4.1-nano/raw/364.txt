Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'o---|--o-|o---|--o-': The kick hits softly on the first beat and on the third beat.
- Snare '----|X---|--X-|----': Snare hits on beats 2 and 3 with sidestick.
- Hi-hat '----|x---|----|x---': Hi-hat plays soft closed hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Toms '----|----|----|----': No toms.
- Cymbal 'X-x-' lines: The cymbal and ride are present with open and closed hits.

**Request:** Remove all cymbals and ride cymbal.

### Thought process:
- The 'C' and 'R' lines don't exist in the groove, so no change needed there.
- Focus on keeping kick, snare, and hi-hat.

### Final plan:
- Keep 'K', 'S', and 'H'.
- Omit the cymbal 'X-x-' line entirely (it's not present here, so no action).

### **Final edited groove:**

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---

This keeps the groove intact with kick, snare, and hi-hat, following the request of removing cymbals.
