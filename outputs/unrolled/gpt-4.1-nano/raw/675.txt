**Thought process:**

- To add a cymbal hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---` (a crash cymbal).
- To add a tom, change the first beat of T from `----` to `O---` (a tom hit).
- Probably, replace these in the first beat to ensure both are played together.

**Implementation:**

- C: from `----` to `O---`
- T: from `----` to `O---`
- Keep other parts the same.

**Final groove:**

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**Note:** Both cymbal and tom are now played at the very start, fulfilling the request.
