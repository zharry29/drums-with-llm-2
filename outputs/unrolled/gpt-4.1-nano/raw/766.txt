**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `o---|--o-|o---|--o-` (soft kicks on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th beats)
  - Snare (S): `----|X---|--X-|----` (snare hits on beats 2 and 3)
  - Hi-hat (H): `----|x---|----|x---` (hi-hat on beats 2 and 4)
  - Toms (T): all silent
  - Crash (C): all silent
  - Ride (R): `x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-` (ride cymbal pattern)

- Request:
  - To add a snare hit **and** a tom in the very beginning (first beat).

- The first beat currently:
  - Kick: `o---` (soft kick)
  - Snare: `----` (none)
  - Tom: `----` (none)

- Solution approach:
  - Change the snare line for the first beat to include a snare hit, e.g., `X---`
  - Change the tom line to include a tom hit at the start, e.g., `O---`

---

**Final edit:**

- Snare: `X---`
- Toms: `O---`
