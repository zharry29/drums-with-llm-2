**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `O--O` to `O---` for simplicity and clarity.
- To add a snare in the very beginning, change the first beat of S from `----` to `--O-`, placing the snare on the third 16th note of the first beat.
- Keep other parts the same for the rest of the groove.

---

**Final step:**

- K: from `O--O` to `O---`
- S: from `----` to `--O-`

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|--O-|----
S: --O-|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

This placement ensures a clear kick and snare at the very first beat, as requested.
