Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays at the start of measures 1 and 3 with O, and at the third beat in measure 1 and measure 3.
- Snare (S): plays some accents on beats 2 and 4 with various articulations.
- Hi-hat (H): plays a steady pattern of X and x, alternating with slight variation.
- Toms, Cymbals, Ride (T, C, R): silent.

**Request:** no kick and no ride.

So, I will:

- Remove the K and R lines.
- Keep the snare pattern as isâ€”they add rhythmic interest.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern to maintain rhythm.
- Ignore T and C because they are silent.

### Final plan:

- Keep snare on beats 2 and 4 with varied articulations.
- Keep steady hi-hat with X and x pattern.
- Remove the kick and ride.

### Final groove:

K: (removed)
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----

This groove maintains energy with snare hits and a busy hi-hat pattern, fitting the restriction of no kick or ride.
