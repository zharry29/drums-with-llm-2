Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': plays on beat 1 (hard 'O') and beat 3 (hard 'O').
- Snare 'S': plays on beats 2 and 4 with various articulations ('O', 'o', 'X', 'x').
- Hi-hat 'H': plays on every beat with alternating "X", "x" pattern.
- Toms 'T' and cymbals 'C' and 'R': silent.

**Request:** Remove all snare ('S') and hi-hat ('H').

- We'll replace the 'S' and 'H' lines with all dashes ('-').

**Result:** The groove will only have kick drums, which creates a very minimalistic pattern.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This provides only the kick drum pattern and is compliant with the removal of snare and hi-hat.
