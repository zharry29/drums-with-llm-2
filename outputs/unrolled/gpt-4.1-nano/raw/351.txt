Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': o--- | --o- | o--- | --o-  
  - Kick hits on beats 1 and 3 with soft hits.
- Snare 'S': ---- | X--- | --X- | ----  
  - Snare hits on beat 2 and 3.
- Hi-hat 'H': ---- | x--- | ---- | x---  
  - Hi-hat hits on beats 2 and 4 with soft hits.
- Toms 'T': ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  
  - No Toms.
- Cymbals 'C', 'R': 'R' has hits on beats 1, 2, 3, 4 with various articulations, including open and closed.

**Request:** No kick or cymbals.

---

**Approach:**

- Remove 'K', 'C', 'R' lines entirely.
- Keep the 'S' (snare) and 'H' (hi-hat) for rhythm.
- The snippet has snare on beats 2 and 3; I can add some variation or keep as is depending on style.

---

**Final plan:**

- Remove 'K', 'C', 'R' lines.
- Keep 'S' and 'H' as is.
- To add some variation, maybe I will emphasize the snare on beat 3 with a softer or different articulation.

**Final groove:**

S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---

This preserves the snare hits on beats 2 and 3 with some hi-hat pattern, and the kick and cymbal lines are removed as requested.
