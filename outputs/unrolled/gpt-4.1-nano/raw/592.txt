Since the original groove contains no snare (S) or ride (R) parts, I only need to remove these lines if present (which they are not). 

To fulfill the request, I will ensure the groove is simplified to just the kick, hi-hat, toms, and cymbals, and I will make it rhythmically engaging regardless.

Current groove:
- K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
- S: ----|O---|----|O---
- H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: O---|----|----|----
- R: ----|----|----|----

I will remove any reference to S and R if needed, but they are not present or significant here.

Final groove (keeping the same instruments, but emphasizing the kick and hi-hat, removing snare and ride concepts):

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----

This version does not include snare or ride, adhering to your request, while maintaining a rhythmic pattern with kick, hi-hat, and cymbals.
