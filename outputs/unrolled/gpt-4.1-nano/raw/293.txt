Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits at beats 1, 2, and 4, with some variation.
- **Snare (S):** on beat 3.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** playing alternating soft and hard hits ("O-o-"), creating some rhythmic texture.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add a ride cymbal pattern to complement the groove, providing a more consistent cymbal element alongside the hi-hat pattern.

### Approach:
- Introduce ride hits ("O---") on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4 to create steady ride support.
- Keep existing instruments as they are for rhythmic stability.

### Final plan:
- Add "O---" in the R line on all four beats.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern as is to retain the rhythmic texture.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**  
- **Ride cymbal ("O---")** added on all four beats for a steady cymbal support.
- **Hi-hat** remains silent, allowing the ride to carry the cymbal pulse.
- This creates a fuller, more rhythmic cymbal texture complementing the existing groove.
