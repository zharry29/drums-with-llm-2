**Thought process:**

- To add a hi-hat hit at the very beginning, I will change the first beat of H from `X-x-` to a full hit, for example, using `XxXx`.
- To add a tom hit at the beginning, I will change the first beat of T from `----` to `O---`.

**Implementation:**

- H: `XxXx` (hit on all four 16th notes of the first beat)
- T: `O---` (tom hit at the start added)

Rest remains unchanged.

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: XxXx|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: O---|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds a hi-hat hit and a tom at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
