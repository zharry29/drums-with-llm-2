Let's analyze the original groove:

- The original pattern is quite sparse, with only kick (`K`) and snare (`S`) hits, and the hi-hat (`H`) playing on every subdivision.
- The cymbal (`C`) and ride (`R`) are silent.

### Objective:
Add a cymbal hit on the `'a'` of `'1 e & a'` of the second beat.

---

### Understanding timing:

The notation:
- Each beat has 4 subdivisions: 1, e, &, a.
- The second beat covers subdivisions 5-8:
   - 5: start of beat 2 ('1')
   - 6: 'e'
   - 7: '&'
   - 8: 'a'

The `'a'` of beat 2 is **subdivision 8** (the last sixteenth note of the second beat).

### Approach:
- Add an `O` in the cymbal (`C`) line at position 8.

Now, let's determine the position of each character in the notation.

### Counting characters:

The pattern:
`K: O---|----|O---|----`  
`S: ----|O---|----|O---`  
`H: X---|X---|X---|X---`  
`T: ----|----|----|----`  
`C: ----|----|----|----`  
`R: ----|----|----|----`

For each line, counting the characters (excluding the `|`):

- K: O--- (positions 1-4), ---- (5-8), O--- (9-12), ---- (13-16)
- S: ---- (1-4), O--- (5-8), ---- (9-12), O--- (13-16)
- H: X--- (1-4), X--- (5-8), X--- (9-12), X--- (13-16)
- C: ---- (1-4), ---- (5-8), ---- (9-12), ---- (13-16)
- R: ---- (1-4), ---- (5-8), ---- (9-12), ---- (13-16)

Since we need to add a cymbal hit at subdivision 8:

- At position 8: it's the last character of the second group (second beat), which currently is a '-'.

Thus, in the cymbal line (`C`), position 8: change '-' to 'O' to place the cymbal on 'a' of beat 2.

### Final groove:

**Only change: shifting in the cymbal line to put 'O' at position 8.**
