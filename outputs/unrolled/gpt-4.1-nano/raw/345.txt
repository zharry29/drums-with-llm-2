Let's analyze the existing groove:  
- Kick 'K': o--- | --o- | o--- | --o-  
  - Kick hits on beat 1 and 3 with soft hits.
- Snare 'S': ---- | X--- | --X- | ----  
  - Snare hits on beat 2 and 3.
- Hi-hat 'H': ---- | x--- | ---- | x---  
  - Hi-hat played on beats 2 and 4 with soft hits.
- Toms 'T': ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  
  - No tom hits.
- Cymbals 'C' and Ride 'R': ‘R’ has hits, but since the request is to remove snare and cymbals, we will remove 'S', 'C', and 'R'.

**New goal:** Remove all snare and cymbals, leaving only the kick pattern.

**Final step:**  
- Keep only 'K' line as is, remove all other instrument lines.

This version keeps the kick pattern exactly as before, with no snare or cymbals, fulfilling the request.
