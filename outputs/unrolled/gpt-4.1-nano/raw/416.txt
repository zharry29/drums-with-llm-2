Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on the first and third beats with soft hits.
- Snare (S): hits on the second and last beats.
- Hi-hat (H): plays on all beats with consistent closed hits.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C and R): silent.

**The instruction is to remove all hi-hat and kick.**

So, we will remove lines K and H from the pattern.

Remaining instruments:

S: ----|O---|----|O---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

In this process, since only snare remains, the game plan is to keep some snare hits to maintain rhythm, and remove the rest.

**Final version:**

S: ----|O---|----|O---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
K: (removed)
H: (removed)

This results in a simple pattern with snare hits on beat 2 and beat 4, creating a basic backbeat for the groove.
