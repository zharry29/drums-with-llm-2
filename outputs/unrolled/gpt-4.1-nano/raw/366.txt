Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': no hits at all.
- Snare 'S': no hits.
- Hi-hat 'H': hits on beats 2 and 4 with soft open hits ('x---' and 'x---').
- Toms 'T': no hits.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': 'R' has open bell hits, which are cymbal types, so these need to be removed.

**Request:** Remove all cymbals and ride (which in this case are the lines for C and R).

Since 'C' and 'R' are already unused in the original groove, the focus is on ensuring they are removed, and the rest remains.

**Additionally**, I notice there's no kick or snare, so to create a more active groove, I could add some elements like kick or snare, but the main requirement is just to remove cymbals / ride.

### Final plan:
- Keep the 'H' pattern as is.
- Leave 'K' and 'S' empty unless I want the groove to be more active. But since the request is just to remove cymbals/ride, I can keep the groove minimal.

### Final groove:

@@@
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:** Since cymbals 'C' and 'R' are not played, just removing those lines or leaving them as is with no hits satisfies the request.

**Optional:** I could remove 'C' and 'R' lines altogether, but the format appears fixed, so I will keep empty lines for clarity.

**Final answer:**

@@@
K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This fulfills the requirement of removing cymbal and ride hits while maintaining the rest of the groove.
