Let's analyze the existing groove:

- **Kick (K):** alternating between soft and hard hits on different beats.
- **Snare (S):** silence.
- **Hi-hat (H):** very active with steady closed hi-hat "x-x-" on all beats.
- **Toms (T):** only a single hit in measure 3, beat 3 ("---O").
- **Cymbals (C):** consistent with "O---" pattern, adding crash hits.
- **Ride (R):** silence.

---

### Goal:
- Add **more hi-hat** variation or keep existing steady pattern.
- Introduce more **tom** hits for rhythmic interest.

---

### Approach:
1. Keep the hi-hat pattern as steady as possible ("x-x-") for consistent pulse.
2. Add a tom hit in measure 4 at beat 4 ("---O") or in measure 2 for variation.
3. Possibly emphasize the hi-hat with open hits ("o") for contrast.

---

### Implementation:
- Keep hi-hat as "x-x-" pattern.
- Add a tom hit at measure 4, beat 4 ("---O").
- Optional: add an open hi-hat ("o") in measure 2 or 3 for variation.

---

### Final groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|--O-|---O|---O
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

```

**Summary:**
- The hi-hat pattern remains steady for a consistent groove.
- Toms now have hits on measure 2, beat 3 ("--O-") and measure 4, beat 4 ("---O") for rhythmic interest.
- The groove is now fuller with both hi-hat and toms, offering a balanced pattern with rhythm and variation.
