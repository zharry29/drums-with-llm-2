Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3 with variations.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("O---") and beat 4 ("O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes alternating between open and closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash cymbal (C):** hit on beat 1 ("O---").
- **Ride cymbal (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add cymbal activity beyond the crash, to create a more full-sounding groove incorporating both snare and cymbals.

### Approach:
- Keep the existing crash cymbal on beat 1.
- Add ride cymbal hits (say, "O---") on beats 2, 3, and 4 to support the rhythm.
- Keep snare hits as they are, reinforcing the backbeat.
- Maintain hi-hat ghost notes for texture.

### Final plan:
- Add **"O---"** in **R** on beats 2, 3, and 4.
- Keep the crash (**C**) on beat 1.
- Keep existing snare hits on beat 2 and 4.
- Keep hi-hat ghost notes.

### Final groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-

```

This provides:
- A crash cymbal emphasizing beat 1.
- Ride cymbal hits on beats 2, 3, and 4 for continuous support.
- Snare backbeat on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat keeps the groove with ghost notes.

It creates an energetic and balanced rhythmic pattern with both cymbals and snare included.
