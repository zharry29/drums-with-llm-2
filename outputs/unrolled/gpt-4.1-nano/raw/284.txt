Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** on beats 1, 2, and 4 ("O---" pattern).
- **Snare (S):** only on beat 3 in measure 3.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** pattern with alternating soft and hard hits ("O-o-" on all four beats).
- **Cymbals (C, R):** silent.

**Goal:**  
Add a ride cymbal to support the groove, especially emphasizing beats 2 and 4 which are common backbeat placements. Since the hi-hat is silent, we can replace some hi-hat ghost notes with ride hits or add ride hits parallel to the hi-hat pattern to enrich the sound.

### Approach:
- Introduce ride hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the existing kick and snare pattern.
- Keep the Toms pattern as it adds rhythmic texture.
- Typically, ride cymbal hits are placed on beats 2 and 4, so we will add them there for fullness.

---

### Final plan:
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the existing kick, snare, and tom pattern.
- Replace part of the hi-hat pattern if needed for clarity, or keep it as is.

### Final groove:

**Explanation:**  
- **Ride cymbal ("O---")** added on beats 2 and 4 in the first and last measures (mirroring common practice).  
- **Hi-hat ("--O-")** on beats 2 and 4 to support the drum set's pulse without over cluttering.  
- Keeps the consistent Toms pattern for texture.  
- The groove now features both snare and ride, with a rhythmic base from kick and Toms, creating a fuller, more dynamic rhythmic pattern.
