Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': hits on beats 1 and 3, with soft hits.
- Snare 'S': hits on beats 2 and 4 with mixture of open and closed hits.
- Hi-hat 'H': no hits.
- Toms 'T': no hits.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': 'C' has no hits; 'R' (ride cymbal) has hits on every beat with alternating open and closed hits.

**Request:** Remove all toms ('T') and ride cymbal ('R') hits.

Since 'T' already has no hits, no change there. The ride cymbal 'R' currently has hits on every beat with alternating open and closed hits. We need to remove these.

**Approach:**
- Set 'R' line to all dashes ('-') to remove the cymbal hits.

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This meets the request by removing the ride cymbal hits, leaving the rest unchanged.
