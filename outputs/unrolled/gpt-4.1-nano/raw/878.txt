Let's analyze the current groove:

- K (Kick): ----|----|----|---- (no kick, so no change needed)
- S (Snare): ----|----|----|---- (currently no snare hits at all)
- H (Hi-hat): ----|x---|----|x--- (hi-hat on beat 2 and 4 offbeats)
- T (Toms): ----|----|----|---- (none)
- C (Crash): ----|----|----|----
- R (Ride): x---|X-x-|x---|X-x- (consistent ride hits, no issue here)

Since the snare is not currently playing, there are no snare hits on the downbeats of 2 and 4 to adjust.

However, to ensure the groove properly addresses the request and maintains a rhythmic structure, let's assume we want to *add* some snare hits that avoid the downbeats of beats 2 and 4 (meaning, no snare on the 1st note of measure 2 and measure 4).

Currently, the groove has zero snare hits, so it already satisfies the condition.

**In conclusion:**  
The current groove already **has no snare on the downbeats of 2 and 4** because it has no snare at all.  
If we wish to make it more rhythmically interesting, perhaps we can add some offbeat snare hits, but no change is required for the specific instruction.

**Final version (unchanged):**

K: ----|----|----|----  
S: ----|----|----|----  
H: ----|x---|----|x---  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This fulfills the request: **no snare on the downbeat of 2 and 4** because there's no snare at all.
