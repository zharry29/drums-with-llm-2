Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays heavily with multiple hits ("OOO-", "--O-", "OOO-", "OOO").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 ("O---" and "O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** hits on every beat ("O---" in all four measures).
- **Ride (R):** silent.

The goal is to add *both* a ride cymbal pattern and ensure the kick drum is more prominent or rhythmically interesting.

### Approach
- Keep existing kick hits, but perhaps add more on emphasis beats.
- Add ride cymbal hits, typically on beats 2 and 4.
- Possibly reinforce the kick pattern for better groove flow.
- Keep basic crash cymbal pattern.

### Implementation:
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Reinforce kick on beats 1 and 3.
- Keep typical snare pattern.
- Keep existing crash cymbals.

**Summary:**  
- Kick hits on beats 1 and 3, with slight variation.
- Ride cymbal ("O---") added on beats 2 and 4.
- Snare remains on beats 2 and 4.
- Crash cymbals continue pattern.
- The groove now has both rhythm elements, creating a fuller, more dynamic sound.
