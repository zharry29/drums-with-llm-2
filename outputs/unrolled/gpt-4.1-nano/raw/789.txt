**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): all silent
  - Snare (S): all silent
  - Hi-hat (H): open hit on second beat, second subdivision; open hit on fourth beat, first subdivision
  - Toms (T): all silent
  - Crash (C): all silent
  - Ride (R): alternating bell and bow hits, some closed hits
  
- Request:
  - Add a cymbal hit and ride in the very beginning.
  
- Implementation:
  - Add a crash cymbal (`O`) in C line at the first beat.
  - Add a ride cymbal (`O`) in R line at the first beat.

**This includes a cymbal and a ride hit at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.**
