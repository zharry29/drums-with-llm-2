**Thought process:**

- To add a ride hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of R from `----` to `O---` (a ride cymbal on the bell).
- The kick is already present on the first beat of K as `-O--`. To emphasize, I will change it to a proper kick `O---`, matching the other kick hits.
- So, in the first beat, K: `O---` and R: `O---`.

**Implementation:**

- K: change from `-O--` to `O---`.
- R: change from `----` to `O---`.

**Final edited groove:**

K: O---|OO--|---O|O-O-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|----|----|----

Now, the first beat features both a kick and a ride hit, as per the request.
