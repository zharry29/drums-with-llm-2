**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O---|O---|----|O---`
  - Snare (S): `----|----|O---|----` (snare on beat 3 in third measure)
  - Hi-hat (H): `----|----|----|----`
  - Toms (T): `O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-` (percussion pattern on all beats)
  - Crash (C): all silent
  - Ride (R): all silent

- New request:
  - Add a snare hit and a tom in the very beginning (first beat).

- Current first beat:
  - Kick: `O` (already present)
  - Snare: `----` (no)
  - Tom: `O` (present, so thatâ€™s good)
  - So, only need to add a snare hit in first beat, with a new snare symbol.

- To add a snare hit in the first beat:
  - Change S line first beat from `----` to `X---` (hard snare hit).

**Final version:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: X---|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**This includes:**
- A snare hit (`X`) in the very first beat.
- The tom (`O`) in the first beat remains.
- The kick remains on the first beat with a hit (`O`).

This fulfills the request.
