**Thought process:**

- The original groove has:
  - No snare (S) in the first beat (`----`)
  - No cymbal (C) in the first beat (`O---`, so cymbal is already played)
- The request is to add a snare and cymbal at the very start.
- For the snare (S), change the first beat from `----` to `O---`.
- The cymbal (C) already has an `O` in the first beat, so no change needed there.
- Keep the rest of the pattern unchanged.

**Final modifications:**

- First beat of S: `O---`
- C remains `O---` (already present)

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: O---|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**
- The first beat now contains both a snare and a cymbal hit, fulfilling the request.
