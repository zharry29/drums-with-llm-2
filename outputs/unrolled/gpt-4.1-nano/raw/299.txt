Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beats 1 and 3 ("O--O" and "--O-")
- Snare (S): hits on beats 2 and 4 with some ghost and open hits ("Oo-o", "-o--", "O--o")
- Hi-hat (H): silent
- Toms (T): silent
- Crash (C): silent
- Ride (R): playing across all four beats with alternating open and closed hits ("o-O-", "o-O-") pattern

**Objective:**  
Add a prominent snare and also a ride cymbal to the groove to support the rhythm better.

### Approach:
- Make the snare more consistent, e.g., adding snare hits on beat 2 and/or 4 in all measures for a driving backbeat.
- Keep the existing ride pattern, but perhaps make it more prominent or consistent.
- Keep the hi-hat silent (since we are adding ride), or perhaps add ghost hi-hats for texture if desired.

### Implementation:
- Insert **"O---"** or similar in the R line on all four beats.
- Add snare hits ("O--" or "O---") on beat 2 and 4 of all measures to strengthen the backbeat.
- Keep the current ride pattern or reinforce it.

Here's a proposed version:

### Final plan:
- Add **"O---"** in R line on beats 1, 2, 3, 4
- Adjust snare to play on beats 2 and 4 in all measures for a steady backbeat

### Final groove:

**Explanation:**

- **Snare (S):** now hits on beat 2 and 4 consistently in all measures, with a mixture of open and closed hits to add interest.
- **Ride (R):** hits on all four beats ("o-O-" pattern) in each measure, providing steady cymbal support.
- **Kick (K):** slightly adjusted for rhythmic consistency.
- **Hi-hat (H):** remains silent, focusing on ride support.

This setup creates a solid, rhythmic pattern with both ride and snare, suitable for driving the song forward.

**Note:** If you'd prefer, I could also include ghost hi-hat notes for some texture, but as per the instruction, this provides a clear addition of both snare and ride.
