Let's check out the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 ("O---"), beat 2 ("O---"), and beat 4 ("O---").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 3 ("O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** pattern on beats 1-4, alternating soft and hard hits: "O-o-" repeated.
- **Cymbals (C) and Ride (R):** silent.

**New goal:** incorporate toms into this groove for more rhythmic interest, along with the kick.

---

### Approach:
- Use the existing tom pattern "O-o-" on each beat, but add a stronger tom hit (like "O") on beat 3, complementing the snare.
- Place a tom hit on beat 4 ("--O-") as a fill.
- Keep the kick pattern pretty much as is but perhaps add some variation or emphasize some softer hits.

---

### Implementation:
- Keep the existing tom pattern, but add a tom hit on beat 3 ("--O-") to reinforce the rhythm.
- Add a tom hit at the end of beat 4 ("---O") for a fill.
- Make some slight modifications to the kick to keep it dynamic.

### Final groove:

**Highlights:**  
- Added a tom hit "O" on beat 3 ("--O-") for emphasis.  
- Added a tom fill at the end of beat 4 ("---O").  
- Kept the kick pattern intact with slight variation.  
- Maintained original pattern of snare, hi-hat, and cymbals for a cohesive groove.

This inclusion of toms enhances rhythm and fills the space, making the groove more lively.
