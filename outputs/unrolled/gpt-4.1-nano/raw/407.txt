Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on the first beat with a hard hit ('O') and a soft hit ('o') on the second beat, then another on the third beat.
- Snare (S): hits on the second and fourth beats.
- Hi-hat (H): plays a pattern of open and closed hits every beat.
- Toms (T): all silent.
- Crash cymbal (C): plays on the first beat.
- Ride cymbal (R): silent.

**The request is to remove all hi-hat (H) and cymbal (C, R).**

This leaves us with:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: (remove)
T: (remove)
C: (remove)
R: (remove)

Now, to keep the groove rhythmic and interesting:

- Keep the kick pattern as is.
- Keep the snare hits as they establish the rhythm.
- No cymbals or hi-hats.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: (removed)
T: (removed)
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This provides a simple, solid rhythmic foundation suitable for many styles.
