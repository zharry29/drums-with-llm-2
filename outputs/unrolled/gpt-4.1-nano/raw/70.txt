Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3 with "O".
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4, with some open hits ("o").
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays alternating closed hits ("X-x-") on every subdivision, so already has a hi-hat pattern.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### The goal:
Add a *ride* cymbal layer **alongside** the existing hi-hat, for a richer cymbal texture.

### Approach:
- Keep the current hi-hat pattern, which is delivering consistent subdivision hits.
- Introduce *ride* cymbal hits ("O") on appropriate subdivisions. Usually, ride hits are placed on the beat and off-beats, such as on the "and" counts of beats 2 and 4 or filling in some off-beats.
- To complement the close hi-hat pattern, I'll fill in the *ride* hits on the downbeats (beats 1 and 3) and some off-beats, like subdivisions 6 and 14, to maintain flow.

---

### Final plan:
- Keep the existing hi-hat pattern.
- Add *ride* hits ("O") on the downbeats of beats 1 and 3, and on subdivisions 6 and 14 (the "and" of beats 2 and 4).
- The ride pattern will be moderate, layered with the hi-hat.

### Final groove:

```plaintext
@@@
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O--O|--O-|O--O|--O-
@@@
```

**Explanation:**

- Ride ("O") added on first beat, third beat, and the off-beats (subdivisions 6 and 14, represented as "--O-").
- The hi-hat continues with "X-x-", giving a layered hi-hat and ride textures.
- The kick and snare pattern remains unchanged for rhythmic stability.

This creates a fuller, more layered cymbal texture while preserving the groove's feel.
