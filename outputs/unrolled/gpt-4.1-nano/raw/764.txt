**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O---|O---|----|O---` (kick on first, second, and fourth beats)
  - Snare (S): `----|----|O---|----` (snare on beat 3)
  - Hi-hat (H): `----|----|----|----` (no hi-hat hits)
  - Toms (T): `O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-` (consistent pattern)
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): silent

- Request: add a hi-hat hit and a kick in the very beginning.
- Currently:
  - Kick in first beat: `O` (present)
  - Hi-hat in the first beat: none (`----`)

- Solution:
  - Add a hi-hat hit in the first beat: change first beat of H to `x---` (soft closed hi-hat)
  - The kick is already present with `O` in the first beat. 

**Final plan:**

- Keep the existing kick in the first beat.
- Change the first beat of H from `----` to `x---`.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: x---|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**  
The first beat now includes both a kick (`O`) and a hi-hat (`x`), fulfilling the request.
