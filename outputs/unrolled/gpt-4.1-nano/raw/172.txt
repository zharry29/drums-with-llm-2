Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits heavily on beats 1 ("OOO-") and 3 ("OOO-"), and on beat 2 ("--O-") and beat 4 ("-OOO")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("O---") and beat 4 ("O---") with some ghost hits
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on beat 1, beat 2, beat 3, and beat 4 ("O---" in each measure)
- **Ride (R):** silent

### Goal:
Add toms and emphasize cymbals to enrich the pattern while keeping the existing elements.  
Since cymbals are already present (O in C), we can keep that but perhaps vary the crash, and add tom hits for more depth.

### Approach:
- Introduce a tom hit on beat 2 or 4 ("-O--") for accent.
- Add a crash cymbal at the start or with emphasis on one of the beats for impact.

**Note:** The current groove already has cymbal hits in each measure, so perhaps we can enhance the cymbal pattern or vary the crash placement to add variation.

### Plan:
- Keep the existing kick pattern.
- Maintain the snare on beats 2 and 4.
- Add tom hits on beat 2 or 4 for variation.
- Add a crash cymbal on beat 1 at the start of a measure.
- Keep hi-hat silent for now, as focus is on toms and cymbals.

### Final groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|--O-|----|--O-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

```

**Explanation:**
- The cymbal pattern remains the same for continuity.
- Added tom hits on beat 2 and 4 ("-O--") for depth.
- Keep the existing kick and snare pattern.  
This version provides added toms and maintains cymbal hits, enriching the overall groove.
