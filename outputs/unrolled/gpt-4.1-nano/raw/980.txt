Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** Hard hits on beats 1 and 3, which is quite standard.
- **Snare (S):** On beats 2 and 4, very common.
- **Hi-hat (H):** Playing on every subdivision (every 16th note), making it very busy.
- **Toms, Crash, Ride:** No hits.

Since the goal is **less notes**, I will focus on simplifying:

- Keep the kick on beats 1 and 3.
- Keep the snare on beats 2 and 4.
- Simplify the hi-hat â€” perhaps only keep one hit per beat or even remove some.
- Remove the hi-hat hits on subdivisions if possible for more space.
- Remove any undefined fills or extra hits.

---

### Adjustments:
- Keep only one hi-hat hit per beat, e.g., on the first subdivision of beats 1 and 3.
- Keep the kick on beats 1 and 3.
- Keep snare on beats 2 and 4.
- Remove toms, crash, and ride for simplicity.

This minimal pattern reduces the density and creates a simple, clean rhythm with just essential hits.
