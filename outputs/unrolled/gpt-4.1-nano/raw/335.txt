Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': no hits
- Snare 'S': no hits
- Hi-hat 'H': X--- and X--- (beats 1 and 4)
- Toms 'T': no hits
- Cymbals 'C': no hits
- Cymbals 'R' (ride): x---, X-x, x---, X-x
  - Closed hi-hat and ride cymbal combined pattern.

**Request:** Remove hi-hat 'H' and Toms 'T'.  
- Keep the cymbal 'R' pattern as is, or remove if needed.

### Key considerations:
- Since the instruction only specifies removing hi-hat and Toms, the cymbals can stay.
- To keep rhythm interest, I can add in some basic kick and snare pattern.

### Approach:
- To simplify, I will remove 'H' and T.
- Keep 'K' and 'S' empty.
- Keep the cymbal pattern for some rhythmic color.

### Final plan:
- Remove 'H' and 'T'.
- Keep 'K', 'S', and 'R' as they are.

**Note:**  
This groove emphasizes the cymbals rhythm, with no other percussion, matching the request to remove hi-hat and toms. If you want a more active pattern, we could add some kicks or snare hits, but as per instructions, this is a clean version.
