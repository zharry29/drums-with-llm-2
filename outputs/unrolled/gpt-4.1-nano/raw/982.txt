Let's analyze the original pattern:

- **Kick (K):** Hits on beat 1 (hard), beat 3 (hard); sparse otherwise.
- **Snare (S):** Plays on beats 2 and 4 with some open and closed accents.
- **Hi-hat (H):** Very active, playing on every subdivision with alternating open/closed hits.
- **Toms, Crash, Ride:** No hits.

Since the goal is **less notes**, we should simplify by removing unnecessary hits:

- Keep the kick mainly on the downbeats (beats 1 and 3).
- Keep snare only on beats 2 and 4, but perhaps reduce open and closed variations.
- Remove hi-hat activity entirely for clarity.
- Keep Toms, Crash, and Ride silent for minimalism.

### Proposed plan:
- Kick: Keep only on beats 1 and 3.
- Snare: Keep only on beats 2 and 4.
- Remove hi-hat.
- Remove Toms, Crash, Rides.

### Final simplified pattern:

K: O---|----|O---|----

T: ----|----|----|----

This results in a minimal, clear groove with just the essential kick and snare hits, creating space and simplicity in the rhythm.
