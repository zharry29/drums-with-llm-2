Let's analyze the current groove:

- K (Kick): O---|O---|----|O---
- S (Snare): ----|----|O---|----
- H (Hi-hat): ----|----|----|----
- T (Toms): O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- C (Crash): ----|----|----|----
- R (Ride): ----|----|----|----

**Observations:**
- The snare is only on beat 3 (third measure).
- The ride cymbal (R) is absent.
- Toms are played rhythmically in all four measures to add texture.

**Objective:**
- Incorporate a ride cymbal pattern.
- Add snare hits, possibly on beats 2 and 4, for a more driving rhythm.

### Approach:
- Place 'R' (ride) hits on notes 1 and 9 (beats 1 and 3).
- Add snare 'S' on notes 5-8 (second beat) and 13-16 (fourth beat) for a strong backbeat.

### Final plan:
- Add 'S' to measures 2 and 4 on notes 5-8 and 13-16.
- Add 'R' to measure 1 (note 1) and measure 3 (note 9).

**Explanation:**
- Snare hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Ride cymbal hits on beats 1 and 3.
- Toms rhythm remains to add texture.
- Kick maintained to support the groove.

This creates rhythmic drive with both snare and ride added, enriching the pattern.
