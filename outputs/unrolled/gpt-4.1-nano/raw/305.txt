Let's review the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 ("O---", "O---", "O---")
- **Snare (S):** hits only on beat 3 ("O---")
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent
- **Toms (T):** pattern with ghost notes on beats 1 and 2 ("O-o-") pattern repeated four times
- **Crash (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** silent

**Objective:**
- Incorporate a **ride cymbal** (R) pattern to add rhythmic support.
- Keep or strengthen the **snare** hits.

---

### Approach:
- Add **"O---"** in the R line on all four beats for steady ride.
- Keep the snare pattern on beat 3, possibly adding more emphasis by making it more consistent or adding a rimshot variation.
- Maintain the ghost notes on Toms for texture.

---

### Final plan:
- Insert **"O---"** for ride cymbal on all beats.
- Keep the snare on beat 3.
- Keep the ghost notes on Toms pattern intact, as it gives a nice texture.

### Final edited groove:

**Summary:**
- Ride now plays on all four beats for steady cymbal support.
- Snare remains on beat 3, maintaining rhythmic emphasis.
- Ghost notes on Toms add texture.
- Kick pattern remains similar, reinforcing the groove.

This creates a more balanced and rhythmically interesting pattern with both ride and snare included.
