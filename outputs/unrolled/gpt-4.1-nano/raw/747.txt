**Thought process:**

- The original groove has:
  - No snare (S) in the first beat (`----`)
  - No kick (K) in the first beat (`O--O`)
- To fulfill the request:
  - Add a snare hit in the first beat of S: change `----` to `O---`.
  - Keep the kick as it is or ensure it's played in the first beat; it's already `O--O` which includes kick hits, so no change needed in K.
- Only need to change the snare line's first beat from `----` to `O---`.

**Finaledited groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: O---|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**  
The first beat now includes both a kick and a snare, fulfilling the request.
