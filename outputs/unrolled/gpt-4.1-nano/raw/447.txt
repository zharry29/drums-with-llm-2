Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): soft hits on beats 1 and 3, with a pattern o---|--o-|o---|--o-
- Snare (S): hits X on beat 2 and 3 (X---|X---|--X-|----)
- Hi-hat (H): soft hits x--- on beats 2 and 4
- Toms (T): silent
- Cymbals (C): silent
- Ride (R): various closed hits (X-x-), not relevant now since they are a cymbal

**Request:** no cymbal or snare.

This means:

- Remove snare (S) and cymbal (C) lines.
- Keep kick and hi-hat patterns as they are, since they don't involve cymbals or snare.
- Toms and ride are silent, so no change needed there.

**Final plan:**

- Keep the kick pattern (o---|--o-|o---|--o-),
- Keep hi-hat pattern (x---|x---|x---|x---), to maintain groove.
- Remove the snare and cymbal lines.

### Final groove:

@@@
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: (removed)
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This provides a simple, steady rhythm with kick and hi-hat only, fulfilling the request to exclude cymbals and snare.
