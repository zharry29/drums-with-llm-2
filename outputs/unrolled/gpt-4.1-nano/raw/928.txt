Let's analyze the current groove step-by-step:

- The cymbal line (R) is: `----|----|----|----`
- This shows no hits at all, including beat 4. So it's already compliant with the request of having no cymbal hits on beat 4.

**Therefore, no change is needed.**

Here's the final version, which remains the same:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The groove already satisfies the condition.
