**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits at first beat (`O---`) and third beat (`O---`)
  - Snare (S): hits on second and last beats
  - Hi-hat (H): consistent closed hits
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): silent

- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and a ride in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - Add a tom hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in T.
  - Add a ride hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in R.

**This includes a tom hit and a ride at the very beginning, as requested.**
