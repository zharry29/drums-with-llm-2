Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': O--- | ---- | O--- | ----  
  - Kick hits on beat 1 and 3.
- Snare 'S': ---- | O--- | ---- | O---  
  - Snare hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat 'H': X--- | X--- | X--- | X---  
  - Hi-hat played on all beats with consistent closed hits.
- Toms 'T': ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  
  - None.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': none.

**Request:** No snare or cymbal.

### Approach:
- Remove 'S', 'C', and 'R' lines.
- Keep 'K' (kick) and 'H' (hi-hat), as they form the rhythmic backbone.
- Since the request is only to exclude snare and cymbals, I will retain the kick and hi-hat pattern.

### Final output:

K: O---|----|O---|----
H: X---|X---|X---|X---

This groove retains the kick and hi-hat patterns as desired, with no snare or cymbals.
