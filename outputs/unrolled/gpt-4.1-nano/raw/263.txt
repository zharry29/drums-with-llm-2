Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 ("O---") and beat 2 ("---o") with a soft hit at the end of beat 2, and beat 3 ("O-O-")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("O---") and beat 4 ("O---")
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes on each beat ("--o-", "O-o-", "O-o-", "O-o-")
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Crash cymbal (C):** on beat 1 ("O---")
- **Ride cymbal (R):** silent

**Objective:**  
Add a new hi-hat pattern if needed, or make existing hi-hat clearer and more prominent, along with cymbal support.

**Approach:**  
- The current hi-hat pattern features ghost notes ("--o-", "O-o-") on all four beats.  
- To ensure both cymbals and hi-hat are well integrated, I will make the hi-hat pattern a consistent steady pattern ("x---") on all beats, supplementing the ghost notes for texture, or keep ghost notes if subtlety is preferred but clarify their purpose.

I decide to:

- Keep the ghost notes for subtle texture.
- Add a standard consistent closed hi-hat ("x---") on every beat for clarity.
- The cymbal remains in the percussion line (there's a crash on beat 1).

Here's the plan:

- Keep the "x---" on beats 1-4 in the hi-hat line.
- Keep the ghost notes ("--o-") etc., for subtle texture.
- Keep crash in the first beat.

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

This pattern now:

- Has a steady closed hi-hat on all four beats ("x---").
- Maintains some ghosted hi-hat notes for variation.
- Keeps the crash cymbal at the beginning.

Would you like more subtlety or variation? But this pattern provides clear cymbal and hi-hat support while keeping the original groove intact.
