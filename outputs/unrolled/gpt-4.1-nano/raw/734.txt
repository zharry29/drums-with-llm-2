**Thought process:**

- The original groove has no snare or hi-hat hits at the start.
- To meet the request, I will add a snare hit (`O`) at the very start and a hi-hat hit (`x`) as well.
- The first beat currently has K: `O---` and H: `--o-`.
- I will change the first beat of S from `----` to `O---` (snare hit).
- The hi-hat (H) already has an `o` in the first beat, but to make it more prominent as a hit, I will change it to `x---`) for consistency and clarity.

**Implementation:**

- Change S (snare) first beat to `O---`.
- Change H (hi-hat) first beat to `x---`.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: O---|O---|----|O---
H: x---|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:** Now, both a snare and a hi-hat are hit in the very first beat, fulfilling the request.
