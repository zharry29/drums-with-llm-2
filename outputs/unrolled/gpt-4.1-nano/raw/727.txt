**Thought process:**

- The original groove has a hi-hat pattern `x-x-` on all beats, already including hits at every quarter note.
- The request is for a hi-hat hit and a cymbal in the very beginning.
- Since the hi-hat already hits at the start, I will focus on adding a cymbal hit at the very beginning.
- For the cymbal, I will set the first beat of the C line from `O---` to `O---` (already an O at the start), but to emphasize, I will explicitly add a crash cymbal hit at the beginning.

**Implementation:**

- Change the first beat of C from `O---` to `O---` (already has an O, so no change needed).
- To explicitly add a cymbal hit, I will change first beat to `O---` (already), or just leave it as is for clarity.

**Final result:**

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:**  
- The groove already contains a hi-hat hit (`x-x-`) at every beat, including the start.
- The cymbal is already at the start with `O---` in the C line, so no change is necessary.

If an explicit emphasis is needed, I could also write:

@@@
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

But the original is acceptable as it already meets the criteria.
