To fill the entire bar with double kick, I will replace the K line so that every 16th note has a kick hit, using `O` to represent a hard hit on every note. This will make the pattern very energetic and evenly distributed.

The original K line is:
`O---|O---|----|O---`

Replacing it completely with continuous kicks:
`OOOO|OOOO|OOOO|OOOO`

The other instrument lines can stay as they are, since the focus is on the kick pattern.

### Final pattern:

K: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

This pattern now has a kick on every 16th note, fulfilling the request.
