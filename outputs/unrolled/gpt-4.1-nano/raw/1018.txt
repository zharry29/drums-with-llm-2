Let's analyze the current groove:

- The Toms are silent (`----|----|----|----`), so to add more dynamics, I will introduce a pattern with hits and accents while keeping their placement on all four beats.
- The rest of the groove is straightforward, with some kick and snare hits, plus consistent hi-hat hits.

**Objective:**  
Make the Toms more active and expressive, using soft and hard hits, possibly with accents, to add energy and variation.

### Thought process:
1. Keep the Toms pattern on all four beats.
2. Use a mix of accentuated hits (`X`, `O`) and softer hits (`x`, `o`) for variety.
3. Create a pattern that alternates between a strong hit on the downbeat and softer or accented hits on off-beats.

### Proposed Toms pattern:
- Beat 1: `X---` (strong downbeat)
- Beat 2: `--o-` (soft off-beat)
- Beat 3: `O---` (accented)
- Beat 4: `--o-` (soft off-beat)

### Final pattern:
`X---|--o-|O---|--o-`

**Summary:**  
This revision introduces a more lively and dynamic Toms pattern while maintaining their placement on all four beats, enhancing the groove's overall energy.
