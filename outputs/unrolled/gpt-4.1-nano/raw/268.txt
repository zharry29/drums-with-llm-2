Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** silent
- **Snare (S):** silent
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes ("x---") on beat 2 and 4
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbal (R):** alternating soft and hard closed hi-hat hits, which seems to act as a cymbal pattern (likely ride or crash pattern with bell hits)

The instruction is to add **both** cymbal and hi-hat support, meaning we should feature a dedicated cymbal instrument (like a crash or ride) along with the hi-hat.

### Approach:
- For the cymbal, choose a cymbal instrument (e.g., Ride or Crash) and add hit patterns.
- Keep the hi-hat, perhaps with ghost notes for subtle texture.
- To clarify, I will assign "C" as the cymbal line if not assigned yet, or add a dedicated cymbal pattern if missing.

Since the current "C" line is empty in the provided, I will assume we now need to explicitly add cymbal hits (like a crash on beat 1 or a ride pattern).

### Proposed plan:
- Keep the hi-hat ghost notes on beat 2 and 4 ("x---")
- Add a cymbal hit on beat 1 ("O---") for emphasis
- The current pattern to preserve: the hi-hat ghost notes pattern, now add the cymbal.

### Final groove:

```

**Explanation:**
- The crash cymbal "O---" on beat 1 provides emphasis.
- The hi-hat ghost notes ("x---") still give subtle rhythmic support on beats 2 and 4.
- The rest remains unchanged to preserve the groove.

This configuration fulfills the requirement: both cymbal and hi-hat are present, with a balanced and clear rhythmic support.
