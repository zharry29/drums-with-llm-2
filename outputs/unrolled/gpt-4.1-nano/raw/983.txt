Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** Has hits on beats 1 (hard) and 3 (hard), with a pause in the second half.
- **Snare (S):** On beats 2 and 4, with some open and closed accents.
- **Hi-hat (H):** Alternates X and x, playing on every subdivision.
- **Toms, Crash, Ride:** No hits.

**Goal:** Fill the entire bar with double kicks, which means every 16th note should have a kick (either O or o). Since the notation is 16 characters per line, I will replace the entire K line accordingly.

### Approach:
- For a dense, energetic pattern, place a kick on every 16th note with alternating articulation if desired.
- For simplicity, use only `O` (hard hits) on all 16 notes for relevance.

---

### Final pattern:
- Fill every position in K with `O` to represent a double kick pattern.

### Final groove:

K: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

This creates a continuous, energetic double kick pattern that fills the entire bar, fulfilling the "fill up with double kicks" request.
