Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': hits on beats 1 and 3 with soft and hard hits.
- Snare 'S': hits on beats 2 and 4 with mixed open and closed hits.
- Hi-hat 'H': plays rapid X-x pattern on every beat.
- Toms 'T': no hits.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': no hits.

**Request:** Remove any toms ('T') and ride cymbal ('R') hits.

Since 'T' has no hits, no change needed there. 'R' is already empty.

**Approach:** 
- For 'R', set all hits to '-'.

### Final edited groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This removes ride cymbal hits, fulfilling your request, and keeps the rest of the groove intact.
