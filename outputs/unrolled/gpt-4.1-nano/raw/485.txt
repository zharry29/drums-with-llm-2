The instruction is to remove all kick (K) and hi-hat (H) parts. So, I will eliminate those lines completely. The remaining instruments are snare (S), Toms (T), Cymbal (C), and Ride (R).

In the original:
- K: plays at some beats, but we will remove it.
- H: plays on every beat with X-x-, so it will also be removed.
- S: has various hits including soft and hard on beats 2 and 4.
- T, C, R: no hits in this groove.

To produce a new pattern, I’ll focus on making the rhythm interesting with the remaining snare, cymbals, and ride. The snare already provides some accents, so I’ll keep that.

### Final plan:
- Remove `K` and `H` lines.
- Keep `S` with its hits.
- Keep `R` with some hits for rhythm.

### Proposed pattern:
- Keep Snare (S) with hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep Ride (R) with hits on beats 1 and 3 for a steady pulse.
- T and C remain silent.

### Final groove:
```plaintext
K: (removed)
S: ----|--o-|--o-|O---
H: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|----|O---|----
```

This keeps a simple, steady rhythm emphasizing the snare backbeat and ride cymbal pulsation.
