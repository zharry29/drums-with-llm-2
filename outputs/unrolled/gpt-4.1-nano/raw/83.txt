Let's examine the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3 ("O---" and "O---").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 in measure 2 ("O---") and beat 4 in measure 4 ("O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays steady closed hits on every subdivision ("X---" in all measures).
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

---

### Goal:
Add a tom pattern that complements the existing rhythm, enhancing the groove without disrupting the flow.

### Thought process:
- Introduce a tom hit ("O") in a measure where it can add rhythmic interest.
- A good placement might be measure 1 or 3, perhaps near the midpoint, for contrast.
- For measure 1, add a tom hit at subdivision 6 for a quick fill.
- For measure 3, add a tom hit at subdivision 14 for variation.

---

### Final plan:
- **Measure 1:** add a tom ("O") at subdivision 6.
- **Measure 3:** add a tom ("O") at subdivision 14.
- Keep all existing patterns.

### Final edited groove:

**Summary:**
- Added a tom at subdivision 6 in measure 1.
- Added a tom at subdivision 14 in measure 4.
- Maintains the core integrity of the original groove, now with additional tom accents for richer rhythmic complexity.
