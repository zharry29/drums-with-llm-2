**Thought process:**

- The original groove has:
  - No snare in the first beat (`----`)
  - Kick in the first beat: `O--O`
- The request is to make sure both a snare and a kick are played in the first beat.

- The current first beat of the snare (S) is `----`.
- The current first beat of the kick (K) is `O--O`.

- To meet the request, change the first beat of the snare to `O---`, ensuring a snare hit at the very start.

- The kick is already played in the first beat with `O--O`, so no change needed there.

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: O---|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

**Outcome:**
- The first beat now contains both a kick (`O--O`) and a snare (`O---`), fulfilling the request.
