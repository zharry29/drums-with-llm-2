Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 ("O---") and beat 2 ("---o") with a soft hit, and beat 3 ("O-O-").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("O---") and beat 4 ("O---"), solid backbeat.
- **Hi-hat (H):** hits on every beat with ghost notes ("--o-", "O-o-", "O-o-", "O-o-").
- **Toms (T):** silent, but now they need to be added.
- **Cymbals (C):** hits at the start of beat 1 ("O---").
- **Ride (R):** silent.

---

### Objective:
Add toms to this groove, complement the existing rhythm, and add some fills.

### Approach:
- Use the existing pattern as a base.
- Add a tom hit (like "-O--") on beat 3 as a punch.
- Also include a tom hit (like "---O") on beat 4 as a fill.
- Keep the kick, snare, hi-hat, and cymbal pattern to preserve groove consistency.

---

### Final plan:
- Place a tom hit on beat 3 ("--O-").
- Place a tom hit on beat 4 ("---O").
- Optionally, subtly enhance or leave the rest as is.

---

### Final groove:

This version introduces a tom hit on beat 3 and a fill on beat 4, adding rhythmic depth and variation while keeping elements intact for consistency.
