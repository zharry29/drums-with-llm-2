Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** soft hits on beats 1 and 3 ("o---" | "--o-" | "o---" | "--o-")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 (X---), beat 3 (X---), no hits on beat 4
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes on beats 2 and 4 ("x---" | "x---")
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbal (R):** pattern with open and closed hits ("x---" | "X-x-" | "x---" | "X-x-") - provides cymbal texture

The goal: **add a recognizable snare pattern along with cymbals**. Currently, the snare is on beat 2 and 3, but for clarity and more impact, I will emphasize the snare on beats 2 and 4, which are typical backbeat positions. Also, I will enhance the cymbal pattern to balance the groove.

### Plan:
- Keep cymbal pattern as is or slightly adjusted.
- Add or reinforce the snare hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Possibly add a cymbal crash on the first beat for emphasis.

---

### Final decision:
- Snare ("O---") on beats 2 and 4
- Crash cymbal ("O---") on beat 1
- Keep previous cymbal pattern (ride-like), possibly adding a cymbal hit on beat 3 for more presence
- Keep hi-hat ghost notes as is for texture
- Keep kick pattern minimal but supportive

### Final groove:

```

**Summary:**  
- Crash cymbal ("O---") on beat 1 to emphasize start  
- Snare ("O---") on beats 2 and 4 for rhythmic backbeat  
- Slight addition of cymbal hit on beat 3 ("--x-") to enrich cymbal presence  
- Hi-hat ghost notes maintained for texture  
- Kick supports the rhythm quietly

This makes the groove more balanced with both snare and cymbals, maintaining a subtle yet lively rhythmic feel.
