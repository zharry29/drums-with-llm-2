Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): hits on the 1st, 2nd, and 4th beats with hard hits (O), with some on the 1st and 4th beats.
- Snare (S): plays on beat 3 at the first note of that beat.
- Hi-hat (H): no hits currently.
- Toms (T): plays a repeating pattern of O-o- (hard-soft) on each beat, alternating with a pattern, which indicates some rhythmic push.

There are no toms currently. To incorporate some toms, I will add tom hits to create more variation and accentuate the groove.

Thoughts for placement:
- Place a tom hit on beat 2 or 3 for interaction.
- For interest, adding a tom hit on beat 3, perhaps toward the end of that beat.
- Also, a hit on beat 4 could be effective.

Final plan:
- On beat 3, add a soft tom (o) at note 12 or 14.
- On beat 4, add a hard tom (O) at note 16.

Let's insert:
- Beat 3: at note 14, o
- Beat 4: at note 16, O

Updated T line: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o- (original), now changed to include the new tom hits:

- Beat 3: last note (note 14): o
- Beat 4: last note (note 16): O

So, the new T line: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|--O-

Final version:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|--O-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds some tom presence at the end of the measure, creating more variation and dynamic interest.
