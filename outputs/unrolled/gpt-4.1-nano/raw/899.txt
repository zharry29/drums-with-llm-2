Let's analyze the original groove:
- **Kick (K):** no hits
- **Snare (S):** no hits
- **Hi-hat (H):** two hits on beat 2 and 4 (x--- on beats 2 and 4)
- **Toms (T):** no hits
- **Crash (C):** no hits
- **Ride (R):** hits on beat 1 and beat 3, with multiple articulations

Total hits:
- Hi-hat: 2
- Ride: 4 (X-x on beat 1 and beat 3)

Total notes: 6, which is below 8, so no need to remove any.

But the pattern is very sparse. To make it more interesting while still keeping within 8 notes, I can add a kick and a snare hit, possibly on beats 1 and 3 or 2 and 4, respectively.

### Modified plan:
- Add a soft kick on beat 1 for rhythm.
- Keep snare on beat 3 for a backbeat.
- Keep hi-hat on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the ride pattern as is for flavor.

Total planned notes:
- Kick: 1
- Snare: 1
- Hi-hat: 2
- Ride: 4
- Total: 8, exactly at the limit.

K: o---|----|----|----
S: ----|----|--O-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

This pattern:
- Kick on beat 1 (soft).
- Snare on beat 3.
- Hi-hat on beats 2 and 4.
- Ride continues as in original with articulations, adding flavor.
- Total notes = 1 (kick) + 1 (snare) + 2 (hi-hat) + 4 (ride) = 8.

It's a simple, balanced pattern that adheres to the note limit while sounding complete.
