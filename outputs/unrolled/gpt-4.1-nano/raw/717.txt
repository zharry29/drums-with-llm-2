**Thought process:**

- The original groove has a hi-hat pattern `X-x-` repeated each beat, with no ride cymbal hits.
- The request is to add a hi-hat hit and a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning.
- To do this:
  - For the hi-hat (H), to emphasize the initial hit, change the first beat from `X-x-` to `x-x-`. Since the existing pattern already has a hi-hat, Iâ€™ll keep the same but add a ride cymbal.
  - For the ride (R), currently `----`; I will change the first beat to `X---` to add a hard ride cymbal hit.

**Steps:**

- Keep the hi-hat unchanged.
- Add ride cymbal hit at the start.
- No other changes needed.

Now, the groove includes both a hi-hat and a ride cymbal hit in the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
