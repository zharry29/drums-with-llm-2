Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': O--- | ---o | O-O- | ----  
  - Kicks on beats 1, 4, and 3 with varying softness.
- Snare 'S': ---- | O--- | ---- | O---  
  - Snare on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat 'H': --o- | O-o- | O-o- | O-o-  
  - Hi-hat played on all beats with mixed open/closed.
- Toms 'T': ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  
  - None.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': 'C' has hit on beat 1; 'R' none.

**Request:** No snare ('S') or cymbals ('C', 'R').

**Action:**

- Remove the 'S', 'C', 'R' lines entirely.
- Keep the 'K' and 'H' lines for rhythmic foundation, or just the kick if preferred.

Since the request is just to remove snare and cymbals, the simplest is to eliminate 'S', 'C', 'R', leaving only the kick pattern and perhaps hi-hat if requested.

But since the instruction says "no snare or cymbal" only, and we are focused on the core groove, I'll retain only the kick line.

This version contains only the kick drum pattern, fulfilling the request for no snare or cymbals.
