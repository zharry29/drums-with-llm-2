Let's analyze what is present:

- Kick (K): no hits, so we can omit entirely.
- Snare (S): silent.
- Hi-hat (H): plays with x's at beats 2 and 4.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C): silent.
- Ride (R): has some hits on beats 1 and 3 with X-x pattern.

**Request:** no kick or ride.

So, I will:
- Remove K and R lines.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern for rhythm.
- Since snare, toms, and cymbals are empty, I can omit them too (or keep hihat only for simplicity).

The focus will be on hi-hat pattern. To add some variation and keep rhythmic momentum, I'll keep the hi-hat pattern as is, and remove all other instruments.

### Final version:

@@@
K: (removed)
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----

This provides a simple, clean groove with steady hi-hat hits and no kick or ride, fulfilling the request.
