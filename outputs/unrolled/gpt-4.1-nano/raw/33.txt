Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': o---|--o-|o---|--o-
  - Kick hits on:
    - measure 1: beat 1 (o)
    - measure 2: beat 3 (o)
    - measure 3: beat 1 (o)
    - measure 4: beat 3 (o)
- Snare 'S': ----|X---|--X-|----
  - Snare hits on measure 2, beat 1, and measure 3, beat 3 (X on both).
- Hi-hat 'H': ----|x---|----|x---
  - Steady soft hi-hat pattern on beats 2 and 4.
- Toms 'T': none.
- Cymbals 'R': x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
  - Cymbals played on all beats, adding energy.

**Editing goal:**
- Add snare hits to make the groove more dynamic.
- Keep the existing pattern intact, just strengthen the snare presence.

### Approach:
- Add snare hits at more points, perhaps on beats 2 and 4 as well, for a consistent backbeat.
- Leave the existing snare hits.
- Keep the hi-hat and cymbals.

### Implementation:
- Fill in snare 'S' with hits on beats 2 and 4, besides existing hits.
- For example, add 'X' or 'O' symbols on beats 2 and 4 in measures 1 and 3 for the snare.

**Summary:**
- Snare now hits on measures 2 and 3, beats 2 and 4, adding a more driving rhythm.
- The groove stays energetic with consistent cymbals and hi-hat, but gains more emphasis with the added snare hits.
