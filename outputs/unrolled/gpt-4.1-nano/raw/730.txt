**Thought process:**

- The original groove has no snare hit at the start.
- The request is to add a snare hit and a hi-hat hit right at the beginning.
- For the hi-hat, I will add a closed hit (`x---`) at the first beat.
- For the snare, I will add a hard snare hit (`O`) at the first beat.
- The current snare (S) line is `----|O---|----|O---`, so I will change the first beat from `----` to `O---`.
- The hi-hat (H) line is `----|----|----|----`, so I will change the first beat from `----` to `x---`.

---

**Final plan:**

- Snare (S): first beat `O---`.
- Hi-hat (H): first beat `x---`.

**Final groove:**

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: O---|O---|----|O---
H: x---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:** The snare and hi-hat are now both hit at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
