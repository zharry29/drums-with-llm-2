Let's analyze what we have:

- **Kick (K):** silent throughout.
- **Snare (S):** silent throughout.
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes on beats 2 and 4 ("x---" and "x---").
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C, R):** Crash and Ride are present on beat 2 with "X-x-" and beat 4 with "X-x-".

The pattern currently emphasizes the cymbals (crash and ride), with ghost notes on the hi-hat, but no snare or kick. The request is to add more emphasis on snare along with cymbals.

### Thought process:
- To make the groove more lively and full, we can introduce a snare hit on beat 3 ("--O-"), possibly with some ghost notes.
- To add cymbals, we can reinforce the ride (R) or crash (C). Since there's already ride and crash, perhaps we can keep them and make the pattern more dynamic or synchronize snare with cymbals.

### Implementation:
- Add a snare hit on beat 3 ("--O-").
- Keep the ghost notes ("x---") on hi-hat for texture.
- Keep existing cymbal hits.

### Final plan:
- **Snare (S):** add "----" on beats 1 and 3, with a strong hit on beat 3 ("--O-").
- **Cymbals:** keep as is, or possibly add a hit on beat 1 for added emphasis.

### Final groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|--O-|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|--X-|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

```

### Summary:
- Snare now hits on beat 2 (existing) and beat 3 ("--O-"), emphasizing the backbeat and adding a mid-section accent.
- Cymbals stay active, reinforcing the rhythm.
- Ghost notes on hi-hat add texture.

This creates a more energetic groove with both snare and cymbals active.
