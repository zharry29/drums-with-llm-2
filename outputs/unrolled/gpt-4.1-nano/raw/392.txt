Let's examine the original groove:

- Kick 'K': plays on various beats with both hard ('O') and soft ('o') hits.
- Snare 'S': plays in the third beat with 'S'.
- Hi-hat 'H': consistent pattern with alternating closed hits ('x' and '-').
- Toms 'T': plays only on beat 3 with 'O'.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': 'C' has hits on all beats; 'R' is silent.

**Request:** Remove snare 'S' and hi-hat 'H'.

- Replace 'S' and 'H' lines entirely with dashes ('-').

The remaining elements are kick 'K', Toms 'T', and cymbals 'C' and 'R'.

### Final layout:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This version has no snare or hi-hat, focusing on kick, cymbals, and toms, as requested.
