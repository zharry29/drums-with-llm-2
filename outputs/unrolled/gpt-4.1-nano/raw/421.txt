Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays on various beats with both hard and soft hits.
- Snare (S): no hits.
- Hi-hat (H): plays with a consistent x-x pattern on every eighth note.
- Toms (T): plays on the third beat with a hard hit.
- Cymbals (C): plays on every beat with hard hits.
- Ride cymbal (R): silent.

**Request:** Remove all hi-hat and kick (K and H).

### Step-by-step:

1. Remove lines K and H.
2. Keep the rest: S, T, C, R.
3. Since S and R are silent, only T and C are playing.

Toms have a hit in beat 3, C plays on all beats.

### Final pattern:

@@@
S: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
K: (removed)
H: (removed)

This pattern emphasizes cymbals and a tom hit on beat 3, after removing hi-hat and kick, creating a sparse but rhythmic sound.

**Final answer:**

@@@
S: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
