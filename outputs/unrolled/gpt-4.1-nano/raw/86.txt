Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** soft hits ("o") in measures 1 and 3, on beat 1 and 3 respectively.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 and 3 in measures 2 and 3, with sidestick hits ("X").
- **Hi-hat (H):** hits on subdivisions 2 and 14 with soft closed hits ("x").
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** hits on beat 1 and 3 in measures 1 and 3, with variations (bell and closed).

**Objective:**  
Add a tom pattern alongside the cymbals and sustain the overall groove.

### Approach:
- Introduce a tom hit ("O") in measure 2 or 4 for rhythmic variation.
- Place a tom hit in measure 2 at subdivision 6 ("--O-").
- Place a tom hit in measure 4 at subdivision 14 ("-----O").

---

### Final plan:
- Measure 2: add "O" at subdivision 6.
- Measure 4: add "O" at subdivision 14.

### Final edited groove:

```

**Explanations:**
- Added T (tom) at measure 2, subdivision 6.
- Added T (tom) at measure 4, subdivision 14.
- Maintains original component interaction with added tom accents for rhythmic depth.
