**Thought process:**

- The goal is to add a hi-hat hit and a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning.
- The current groove has no hi-hat activity (`H`) at all, so I will add a hi-hat hit (`x---`) in the first beat.
- The ride cymbal (R) in the first beat is `----`; I'll replace that with `X---` to add a hard ride hit.
- The other instruments stay unchanged.

---

**Implementation:**

- H: change from `----` to `x---` for the first beat.
- R: change from `----` to `X---` for the first beat.

**Final groove:**

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: X---|----|----|----

**Note:** The initial hi-hat and ride cymbal hits are now added, fulfilling the request.
