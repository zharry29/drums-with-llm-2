Let's analyze the given groove:

- The second beat has **|Oo-o|**, which corresponds to notes 5-8.
- Currently, the snare line (S) has **Oo-o** in that beat, meaning snare hits on notes 6 and 8 (positions 6 and 8 in the beat).

**Goal:** Place snare hits on **every 16th note (notes 5-8)** in the second beat.

**Approach:**
- Replace the current snare hits in beat 2 with **O** on each note: positions 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Since the snare line has 4 notes in the second beat, I will set:

- Notes 5, 6, 7, 8 â†’ **O**

### Final edited groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: OOOO|----|----|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This ensures the snare is on every 16th note of the second beat, fulfilling the request.
