Let's analyze the current groove first:

- **K (Kick):** hits on beat 1, 3, and 4.
- **S (Snare):** hits on beat 3 in measure 3.
- **H (Hi-hat):** silent.
- **T (Toms):** alternating soft and hard hits ("O-o-") pattern in all measures.
- **C (Crash):** silent.
- **R (Ride):** silent.

### Goal:
Add cymbals and a tom pattern to this groove to make it richer and more layered.

### Approach:
- Introduce a ride cymbal ("R") in measures 2 and 4 for accent.
- Add a tom hit ("O") in measure 2 at a strategic subdivision (e.g., subdivision 6) to complement the rhythm.
- Also, add a tom hit in measure 4 at subdivision 14 for variation.
- Keep the repeating tom pattern from measure to measure to maintain rhythmic consistency.

---

### Final plan:
- **Measure 2:** add "O" at subdivision 6.
- **Measure 4:** add "O" at subdivision 14.
- **Measures 2 and 4:** add ride cymbal "R" at those subdivisions.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----| R--|----| R--
R: ----| R--|----| R--

```

### Explanation:
- **T**: same pattern repeated for consistency.
- **R**: added in measures 2 and 4 at specific subdivisions to serve as cymbal accents.
- **O**: added in measure 2 (subdivision 6) and measure 4 (subdivision 14) for tom accents.

This creates a more dynamic groove with layered cymbals and toms alongside the existing pattern.
