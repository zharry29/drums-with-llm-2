Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3 with soft and hard hits.
- **Snare (S):** plays on beats 2 and 4 with open and closed hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** plays on every beat with alternating open and closed hits.

**Request:** no snare or kick.

Thus, we need to remove **K** and **S** lines entirely.

Remaining instruments: **H**, **T**, **C**, **R**.

In the original, only R has activity; H, T, C are silent.

To keep the groove interesting, I will:

- Remove K and S (already silent).
- Keep the ride cymbal for rhythmic pulse.
- Add a simple hi-hat pattern on the off beats for texture.
- Toms and cymbals remain silent as per the original.

### Final pattern:

@@@
K: (removed)
S: (removed)
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

This provides a steady hi-hat pattern with the ride cymbal, no snare or kick, fulfilling your request. The pattern maintains rhythmic movement with the ride and hi-hat.

### Final answer:
