Let's analyze the timing setup:

- The second beat covers notes 5-8.
- The "1 e & a" subdivision is divided as follows:
  - 1: first note (note 5)
  - e: second note (note 6)
  - &: third note (note 7)
  - a: fourth note (note 8)

We need to add a cymbal hit on the **'a'** of beat 2, which is **note 8**.

Next, locate where note 8 is in the notation:

- The beats are divided here:
  - Beat 2: characters 6-9 (from the second '|').

In the `C:` line:

`C: ----|----|----|----`

- The second beat's characters are '----' after the second '|', corresponding to characters 6-9.
- The last character of that group (character 9 overall) represents note 8 (the 'a').

Currently, character 9 is '-' in the second group.

**Action:** Change that character from '-' to 'O' to insert the cymbal hit on 'a'.

**Summary:**  
- Changed the 9th character in the `C:` line from '-' to 'O' to place the cymbal hit on the 'a' of '1 e & a' of the second beat.
