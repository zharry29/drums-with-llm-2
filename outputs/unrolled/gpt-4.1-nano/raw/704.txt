**Thought process:**

- To fulfill the request, I need to add a cymbal hit and a hi-hat in the very first beat.
- The current groove shows no cymbal hits, so I will add a crash cymbal (C) hit at the first beat by changing the first beat of C from `----` to `O---`.
- The hi-hat pattern is `----`, so to add a hi-hat in the first beat, change H from `----` to `x---`.
- Other parts of the groove stay unchanged.

---

**Implementation:**

- K: `O--O|----|--O-|----` (no change)
- S: same
- H: change first beat to `x---`
- C: change first beat to `O---`
- T, R: stay unchanged

---

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: x---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds both a cymbal hit and a hi-hat at the very beginning, as requested.
