Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1, 3 ("O--O") and 3 ("--O-").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("Oo-o") and beat 4 ("O--o"), with some ghost notes.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** hits "o-O-" pattern, with open and closed bell hits on all beats.

**Objective:**  
Add a ride cymbal pattern to support the snare and enhance the groove.

### Approach:
- Introduce ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4, which is common in many styles.
- Keep existing kick, snare, and ride patterns.
- For variation, we can keep the existing snare pattern which includes ghost notes.

### Implementation:
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the kick as is.
- Keep snare pattern.
- Aval use the existing ride pattern since it already has some ride hits; if you want more pronounced ride, we can add more hits, but for simplicity, just add on beats 2 and 4.

### Final output:

**Summary:**  
- Added ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4 ("--O-" pattern) in the ride line.  
- Maintained the existing groove, keeping the snare, kick, and ghosted hi-hat.  
- The pattern is now more balanced and supports the rhythm more effectively with the ride added.
