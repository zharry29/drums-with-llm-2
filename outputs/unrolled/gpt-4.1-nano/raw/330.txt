Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays various hits, mainly on beats 1, 3, and 4.
- **Snare (S):** plays on beat 2 ("O---") and beat 4 ("O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on all beats with "O---".
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### New instructions:
- No snare and no ride cymbal.

### Approach:
- Remove the snare (S) and ride (R) lines.
- Keep the kick pattern, possibly emphasizing some hits to keep rhythm.
- The hi-hat is silent, which is okay, but adding some pattern there could help.

### Plan:
- Keep the kick pattern mostly as-is.
- Add steady hi-hat if desired.
- Remove S and R lines.

This version keeps the kick rhythm, adds a simple consistent hi-hat pattern for pulse, and removes the snare and ride, fitting your request.
