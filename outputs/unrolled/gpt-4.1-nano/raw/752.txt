**Thought process:**

- The original groove has no sounds in the first beat:
  - K: `----`
  - S: `----`
- The request is to add both a snare and a kick in the very beginning.
- To do that, change the first beat of:
  - K: from `----` to `O---` (a hard kick)
  - S: from `----` to `O---` (a hard snare)
- The rest of the pattern remains unchanged.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|----|----
S: O---|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**Outcome:**
- The first beat now includes both a kick and snare, fulfilling the request.
