Let's analyze the existing groove:
- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 of measure 2 and beat 4 of measure 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays steady closed hits on every subdivision ("X---|X---|X---|X---").
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### Goal:
Add a *ride* cymbal to complement the *hi-hat*. The ride will give additional burst and texture, so adding ride hits ("O") on the usual off-beats or on-beats will create a fuller sound.

### Approach:
- Keep the current hi-hat pattern intact.
- Insert ride hits ("O") in some subdivisions, especially on the "and" counts of beats 2 and 4 for a typical ride pulse.
- Keep the existing kick and snare pattern unchanged for rhythm consistency.

### Final plan:
- Add ride hits ("O") on beat 2 and beat 4, possibly with some on off-beats for more variation.
- The hi-hat remains constant, maintaining a tight high-frequency layer.

**Explanation:**
- The *ride cymbal* ("O") is now also hitting on beat 2 and beat 4 in measures 2 and 4, with additional "O" hits at some subdivisions to keep the groove energetic.
- The *hi-hat* continues with all "X" (closed hits), thickening the high-frequency percussion layer.
- The kick and snare pattern stays intact, combining both cymbals for a fuller, more dynamic rhythm.
