Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on measures 1 and 2 at positions 1 and 4.
- **Snare (S):** hits on measure 2 beat 2 ("O---") and measure 4 beat 4 ("O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays pattern " --o- | O-o- | O-o- | O-o- ", which is quite active with some soft open hits ("o").
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on measure 1 beat 1 ("O---").
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Goal:** To add **tom** instrument and **more consistent hi-hat** pattern.

---

### Approach:
- Add a tom hit in measure 3, for variation, e.g., measure 3 beat 3 ("-O--").
- Keep the hi-hat pattern, but perhaps make it more steady or slightly more enhanced.

---

### Implementation:
- Insert a tom in measure 3, beat 3 ("-O--").
- For the hi-hat, maintain the pattern but consider making it continuous or adding open hits for texture.

### Final drum groove:

**Summary:**
- The hi-hat pattern remains active with "O-o-" and "O-o-" alternating, giving a steady pulse.
- Added a tom hit in measure 3, beat 3 ("-O--").
- The groove now features both hi-hat and tom elements, enriching the rhythm while keeping the original feel intact.
