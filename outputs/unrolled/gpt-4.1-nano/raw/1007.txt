Let's analyze the current groove and the instructions:

**Current Groove:**
- Hi-hat line: `--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`
- The hi-hat uses `o`, `O`, and `-`, with some alternating open and closed hits.

**Instructions:**
- Play **closed hi-hat (`X`)** on **all 8th notes**.
- On **every up beat** (the off-beats following downbeats)—which are notes 2, 6, 10, 14—**open the hi-hat (`O`)**.
- **Keep hits hard** (using `X` for closed and `O` for open, both hard).

### Step-by-step reasoning:

- The 8th notes are at positions: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16.
- Up beats are notes: 2, 6, 10, 14.
- On these up beats: open `O`.
- All other 8th notes: closed `X`.

### Pattern:
- 2: open `O`
- 4: closed `X`
- 6: open `O`
- 8: closed `X`
- 10: open `O`
- 12: closed `X`
- 14: open `O`
- 16: closed `X`

### Construct the hi-hat line:
`-X--|-O--|-X--|-O--`

### Final groove:

H: -X--|-O--|-X--|-O--
T: ----|----|----|----

```

This pattern:
- Plays **hard closed (`X`)** on all 8th notes,
- Uses **open (`O`)** on every **up beat**,
- Maintains a consistent, energetic hi-hat rhythm.
