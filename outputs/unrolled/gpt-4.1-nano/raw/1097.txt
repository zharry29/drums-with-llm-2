Let's analyze the current groove:

- All instruments are mostly silent, except for the hi-hat (`x---` and `x---`) which plays lightly on beats 2 and 4, and ride/cymbal sounds on the ride (`X-x-` and `X-x-`) with closed hits (`X`, `x`) on beats 2 and 4.
- The pattern includes some ride cymbal bells and bongos (X, x) which add some higher frequencies and metallic sounds.

### Goal:
To emphasize **more low-frequency sounds**, generally associated with bass drum, toms, or a heavier sound texture.

---

### Approach:
- Add or emphasize kick drum (low frequency) hits.
- Introduce some toms for depth.
- Reduce or simplify the higher frequency sounds (ride/cymbals) and focus on lower sounds.

### Implementation:
- Add bass drum (kick) hits on downbeats to reinforce low frequencies.
- Use toms on beats or fills for additional depth.
- Keep the hi-hat minimal or replace with a more subdued sound if needed.

### Explanation:
- Kick drum (`O---`) is on beats 1 and 3 to provide a strong low-end foundation.
- Toms now play on beats 2 and 4, adding low-frequency depth and a groovy feel.
- Snare, hi-hat, cymbals, and ride are silenced to make the focus on low sounds.
- This creates a more bass-heavy, lower frequency-centric groove while maintaining a simple structure.

This adjusts the pattern to emphasize low-frequency sounds appropriately.
