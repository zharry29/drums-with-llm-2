Since the request is to remove all kick (K) and hi-hat (H), I will eliminate those lines. The remaining instruments are snare (S), toms (T), cymbals (C), and ride (R).

Original groove:
- K: plays on beats 1, 2, and 4.
- S: plays on beat 3 in measure 3.
- H: silent.
- T: plays in an alternating soft/hard pattern on every beat.
- C: silent.
- R: silent.

To comply:
- Remove `K` and `H`.
- Keep `S`, `T`, `C`, `R` (though R is silent in this groove).

I will also consider that for interest, the snare can keep its beat (measure 3, beat 3) and T can stay active or be silent; but since T is already simple, I will leave it as is.

### Final plan:
- Remove lines K and H
- Keep S and T as they are.
- Keep C if we prefer, but it is silent here; I will keep it for steady rhythm.
- R remains silent.

### Final groove:
```plaintext
K: (removed)
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: (removed)
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This preserves some rhythmic activity via snare and toms, with no kick or hi-hat.
