Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beats 1 and 3.
- Snare (S): hits on beats 2 and 4, with some soft (o) and sidesticks (X, x).
- Hi-hat (H): no hits.
- Toms (T): no hits.
- Cymbals (C): no hits.
- Ride (R): hits alternating with o and O pattern, with open and closed hits.

**Request:** no cymbal or snare.

This simplifies the groove to only the kick and ride, but since cymbals and snare are both to be eliminated, we'll focus on just the kick and the ride.

- Removing the snare and cymbal lines.
- Keep the kick drum pattern for rhythmic foundation.
- Keep the ride pattern if it is acceptable, but since they asked to eliminate cymbals and snare, I interpret that as removing the ride as well (as it's a cymbal).

Thus, the final groove will only have the kick drum pattern, which is the core rhythm.

### Final plan:
- Keep the kick pattern: O--O|----|--O-|----
- Remove all other instruments: snare, hi-hat, cymbal, ride, Toms.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----

This provides a simple, rhythmic foundation with only the kick drum, fulfilling the request.
