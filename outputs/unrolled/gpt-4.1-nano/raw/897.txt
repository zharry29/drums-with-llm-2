Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
  — Three notes (soft kicks on beat 1, 2.3, and 4.3).
- **Snare (S):** ----|X---|--X-|----  
  — Two snare hits, both on beat 2 and 3.
- **Hi-hat (H):** ----|x---|----|x---  
  — Two hi-hat hits, on beat 2 and 4, soft closed.
- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----  
  — none.
- **Crash/Ride (X,x):** X-x-|x---|X-x-|X-x-  
  — Multiple hits, but probably total more than 8 notes.

Total notes:
- Kick: 3
- Snare: 2
- Hi-hat: 2
- Cymbals: multiple, but overall, the pattern exceeds 8 notes.

Since I need to reduce total to 8 or fewer, I will:

1. Remove most auxiliary cymbal hits.
2. Keep a simple pattern with kicks, snare, and hi-hat.
3. Limit total number of hits to fit.

### Simplified plan:

- Keep 1 kick on beat 1 (soft).
- Keep 1 snare on beat 2 or 3 (preferably beat 3 for a backbeat feel).
- Keep 1 hi-hat on beat 1 for a steady pulse.
- Remove all additional cymbal hits.

Total would be around 3 notes, well within limit, but perhaps too minimal. Alternatively, add just one more hi-hat hit for a slight variation.

### Final groove:

K: o---|----|----|----
S: ----|----|--X-|----
H: x---|----|x---|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

- Kick on beat 1.
- Snare on beat 3.
- Hi-hat on beats 1 and 3 for steady pulse.
- No cymbals or tom hits.
- Total notes: 2 (kick) + 1 (snare) + 2 (hi-hat) = 5 notes, fitting the requirement.

This gives a simple, effective backing pattern with minimal notes.
