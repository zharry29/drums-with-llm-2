To fulfill the request:

- Add a kick hit at the very beginning: the kick pattern is currently `O---`, already includes a hit on the first 16th note, so no change needed there.
- Add a ride cymbal hit in the very beginning: change R from `----` to `O---` to emphasize a ride cymbal at the start.

**Summary of changes:**
- R: `----` -> `O---`

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

This ensures a kick and ride cymbal hit at the very beginning, as requested.
