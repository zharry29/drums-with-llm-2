Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1, beat 4, and measure 3's beat 1.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 3 of measure 3.
- **Hi-hat (H):** no hits.
- **Toms (T):** hits on all beats, alternating soft and hard ("O-o-").
- **Cymbals (C):** none.
- **Ride (R):** none.

**Given the request to include both "tom" and "ride"**, we should:

- Add a ride cymbal pattern, typically on beats 2 and 4.
- Maybe add a ride hit on measure 4 beat 4 ("--X-").
- Keep the existing tom pattern, as it's already present.

**Implementation plan:**

- Insert ride hits ("X" for a typical ride hit) on measure 2 beat 4 and measure 4 beat 4.
- Possibly add a ride on measure 3 beat 4 for a smoother ride pattern.
- Keep the tom hits as they are.

K: O---|O---|----|O---

H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|--X-|--X-

```

**Explanation:**

- Added ride hits ("X") in measure 3 beat 4 and measure 4 beat 4.
- Keeps the toms "O-o-" pattern intact.
- Cymbals remain silent, but the ride pattern now adds the desired cymbal layer.
- This provides a balanced pattern with both toms and ride cymbal.
