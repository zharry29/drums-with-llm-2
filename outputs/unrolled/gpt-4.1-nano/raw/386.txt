Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': plays on various beats with hard hits ('O'), including in all four bars.
- Snare 'S': plays on beat 2 and beat 4 with 'O'.
- Hi-hat 'H': silent.
- Toms 'T': silent.
- Crash 'C': plays on beat 1 in all four bars with 'O'.
- Ride 'R': silent.

**Request:** Remove all kick ('K') and toms ('T'). 

- Since 'K' plays throughout, set its line to all dashes ('-').
- 'T' is already silent.

Now, keeping the rest of the pattern intact, the groove will feature snare, hi-hat, and cymbals, creating a minimalistic groove after removal of kick and toms.

### Final groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This keeps the snare on beats 2 and 4, hi-hat silent, and cymbals on beat 1 in each bar, creating a simple, clean rhythm with no kick or toms.
