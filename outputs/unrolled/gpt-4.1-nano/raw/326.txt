Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** soft hits on beats 1 ("o---"), 2 ("--o-"), 3 ("o---"), 4 ("--o-").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 ("X---") and 3 ("--X-").
- **Hi-hat (H):** hits on beats 2 and 4 with soft hits ("x---", "x---").
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** hits on every beat with alternating open and closed hits.

---

### New instructions:
- Remove snare (S) and ride cymbal (R).

### Approach:
- Remove the S and R lines entirely.
- Keep the kick pattern, but perhaps make it more rhythmically full.
- Keep the hi-hat (H) pattern for maintaining pulse.

### Final plan:
- Maintain the current kicks, or add support if desired.
- Keep hi-hat pattern.
- No snare or ride.

### Final groove:

```plaintext
@@@
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

This retains the core rhythmic pulse, with the kick supporting the overall groove, and the hi-hat providing consistent timing, all without snare or ride cymbal as per your request.
