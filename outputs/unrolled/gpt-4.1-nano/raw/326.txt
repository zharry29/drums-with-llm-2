Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': o---|--o-|o---|--o-
  - Kick hits:
    - measure 1: beat 1 (o)
    - measure 2: beat 3 (o)
    - measure 3: beat 1 (o)
    - measure 4: beat 3 (o)
- Snare 'S': ----|X---|--X-|----
  - Snare hits on measure 2, beat 1 and measure 3, beat 3 (not required now).
- Hi-hat 'H': ----|x---|----|x---
  - Hi-hat pattern with soft closed hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Toms 'T' and Cymbals 'C': none.
- Ride 'R': x---|X-x-|x---|X-x- (will be removed per the request).

### New plan:
- Remove all snare 'S' and ride 'R' hits.
- Keep the kick hits, perhaps adding some more to make the pattern consistent and driving.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern for rhythm.

### Implementation:
- Make the kick hit on every beat (every 4th note), or at least on beats 1 and 3 of each measure for consistency.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern.
- Remove snare and ride.

K: O---|O---|O---|O---
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This pattern provides a steady, driving rhythm with kicks on every beat, along with hi-hat grooves, fully aligned with the directive to remove snare and ride.
