Let's analyze the original groove:

- The second beat is **O---|** (notes 5-8).
- The snare line currently has **O---** in that beat, meaning a hit on note 5 only.

**Goal:** Place snare hits on **every 16th note (notes 5, 6, 7, 8)** in the second beat.

So, I will update the snare line's second beat to **OOOO** (hits on notes 5-8).

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|OOOO|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Now there are snare hits on every 16th note in the second beat, fulfilling the request.
