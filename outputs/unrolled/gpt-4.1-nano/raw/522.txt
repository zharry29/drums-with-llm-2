The instructions are to remove the Toms (T) and Hi-Hat (H) lines.  
- The T line: `----|----|----|----` — remove it.  
- The H line: `X---|X---|X---|X---` — remove it.

Remaining instruments:
- K (kick): `O---|----|O---|----` (keep)
- S (snare): `----|O---|----|O---` (keep)
- R (ride cymbal): `----|----|----|----` — removable, but since no other cymbals are left, just remove it.

**Modified drum groove:**

This version removes the hi-hat and toms, leaving a simple groove with kick and snare only.
