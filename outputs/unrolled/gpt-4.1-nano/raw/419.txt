Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 with various degrees of softness.
- Snare (S): silent.
- Hi-hat (H): silent.
- Toms (T): plays with alternating soft and hard hits on all beats.
- Cymbals (C and R): silent.

**The instruction:** remove all hi-hat and kick, so lines K and H should be completely removed.

Remaining patterns:

S: ----|----|O---|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Now, only snare and Toms remain.

Since snare is silent, perhaps we can keep Toms to add rhythmic interest or simply remove all remaining instruments for a minimalistic approach.

But given the previous patterns, I will keep the Toms pattern for rhythm.

### Final step:
- Remove lines K and H.
- Keep T for texture.
- Keep silence elsewhere.

T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
S: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
K: (removed)
H: (removed)

This pattern provides a rhythmic Toms pattern with the rest silent, matching the request to exclude hi-hat and kick.
