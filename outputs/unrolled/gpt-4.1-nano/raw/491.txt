The instruction is to remove all ride cymbal (R) and hi-hat (H) parts.  
- The H line is completely empty, so just remove it.  
- The R line is also empty, so remove it as well.  

Remaining instruments are:
- K: Kick drum, with hits on beats 1, 2, and 4.
- S: Snare, with a hit on beat 3.
- T: Toms, with alternating soft and hard hits on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the user wants no ride or hi-hat, I will retain the kick, snare, and toms, focusing on creating a clear rhythmic pattern.

### Final pattern:
- Keep the kick (O---, O---, ----, O---).
- Keep the snare (----|----|O---|----).
- Keep the toms (O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-), which adds a rhythmic layer.

**Final version:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

This pattern maintains a rhythmic groove without hi-hat or ride cymbal, with kick, snare, and toms providing the rhythm.
