Let's analyze the original groove:

- The **kick** (`K`) has multiple hits with strong (O) and some softer hits (`-`), providing a driving rhythm.
- The **snare** (`S`) has hits on beats 2 and 4 (O) with a few rests.
- The overall groove is steady but could benefit from some subtle, ghost snare notes to add groove complexity and groove depth.
- The **hi-hat**, **toms**, and **cymbals** are silent.

**Goal:**  
Add ghost snare notes to enrich the groove without overwhelming the main backbeat.

### How to add ghost notes:
- Insert soft snare hits (`o`) on the “and” subdivisions of beats 2 and 4, or in between the main hits.
- Maintain the main strong hits (`O`) on beats 2 and 4 to preserve the fundamental pulse.

---

### Approach:
- Between beat 2 and 3, add a ghost `o`.
- Between beat 4 and the next beat (measure start), add a ghost `o`.
- Keep the main hits intact for clarity.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**
- The snare now includes subtle `o` ghost notes on the “and” subdivisions of beats 3 and 4.
- The groove has increased feel while keeping the main hits clear.
- Adds groove complexity and depth to the original pattern.
