**Thought process:**

- The original groove:

  - Kick (K): `OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO` (kick in various quarters)
  - Snare (S): `----|O---|----|O---` (snare on beats 2 and 4)
  - Hi-hat (H): `----|----|----|----` (no hi-hat hits)
  - Toms (T): all silent
  - Crash (C): `O---|O---|O---|O---` (crash hits on each beat)
  - Ride (R): all silent

- The request: add a hi-hat hit and a kick in the very first beat.  
- Currently, the first beat for the kick is `O` (hard hit).  
- For the hi-hat, the current pattern has no hits, so we need to add a hit.

- To meet the request:
  - Change the first beat of H from `----` to `x---` (soft closed hi-hat).

**Final groove:**

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**

- The first beat now contains both a kick (`O`) and a hi-hat (`x`), fulfilling the request.
