**Thought process:**

- To add a ride hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of R from `----` to `O---`.
- To add a tom hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of T from `----` to `O---`.

**Implementation:**

- R: `O---` (ride hit)
- T: `O---` (tom hit)

Rest of the pattern remains unchanged.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

This begins with both a ride hit and a tom hit, fulfilling your request.
