**Thought process:**

- The original groove has the hi-hat (`H`) silent at the beginning (`----`) but has a ride cymbal (`R`) silent as well.
- The request is to add a hi-hat hit and a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning.
- To do this:
  - For the hi-hat (`H`), in the first beat, replace `----` with `x---` to add a soft hi-hat hit.
  - For the ride cymbal (`R`), in the first beat, replace `----` with `X---` to add a hard ride cymbal hit.
- The rest of the groove remains unchanged.

**Final edited groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: x---|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: X---|----|----|----

This now has a hi-hat and ride cymbal in the very beginning, as requested.
