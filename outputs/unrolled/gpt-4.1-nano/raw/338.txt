Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': O--- | ---o | O-O- | ----  
  - Kicks at the start of the first beat, 2nd beat soft hit, and first and third beats.
- Snare 'S': ---- | O--- | ---- | O---  
  - Snare hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat 'H': --o- | O-o- | O-o- | O-o-  
  - Hi-hat plays on all beats, various open and closed hits.
- Toms 'T': ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  
  - None.

**Request:** No hi-hat 'H' and no toms 'T'.

---

### Approach:
- Remove 'H' and 'T' lines.
- Keep 'K', 'S', and 'C' (cymbal) as they are.
- Possibly enhance the percussion pattern with a straightforward kick and snare rhythm while keeping cymbals, which adds rhythmic interest.

### Final pattern:
- The kick pattern: remains as in the original.
- The snare: keeps hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Cymbals: keep for added rhythm.
