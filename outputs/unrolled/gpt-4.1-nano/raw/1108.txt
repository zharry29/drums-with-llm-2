Let's analyze the original groove:

- The kick (`K`) hits heavily with multiple hits in the first and third beats, and some in the second beat.
- The snare (`S`) hits on the second beat (O) and the last beat (O).
- The hi-hat (`H`) and cymbals (`C`) are silent.
- The ride (`R`) is silent.

### Objective:
Add a cymbal hit exactly on the 'a' of the '1 e & a' of the second beat. 

### Understanding the timing:
- Each beat has four subdivisions, making 16 sixteenth notes in total.
- The 'a' of '1 e & a' of the second beat is the 16th note position 13 (counting from 1).

Counting subdivisions in the second beat:
- 1 e & a corresponds to notes 9 (1), 10 (e), 11 (&), 12 (a). 
- Actually, the positions:
  - 9: beat 2, first subdivision
  - 10: beat 2, 'e'
  - 11: beat 2, '&'
  - 12: beat 2, 'a'
  
Wait, the 'a' of beat 2 is position 13 (since:
- beat 1: notes 1-4
- beat 2: notes 5-8
and within beat 2:
  - 1: note 5
  - e: note 6
  - &: note 7
  - a: note 8

**Correction:** 
- The 'a' of beat 2 is position 8 + 4 (4 subdivisions per beat): so note 8 of second beat: position 8, which is the 16th note at subdivision 8.

Actually, in standard notation:
- Beat 1: notes 1-4
- Beat 2: notes 5-8
- Beat 3: notes 9-12
- Beat 4: notes 13-16

But the specific note 'a' corresponds to the 16th note position 8+4=12. Since subdivision counts go:
1: note 1
2: note 2
3: note 3
4: note 4
5: note 5
6: note 6
7: note 7
8: note 8
9: note 9
10: note 10
11: note 11
12: note 12
13: note 13
14: note 14
15: note 15
16: note 16

Therefore, the 'a' of beat 2 is note 12 exactly.

### Final plan:
- Add a cymbal hit (`O`) on note 12 (the 'a' of the second beat).

### Implementation:
- The 16th notes are grouped in four quartets per beat; note 12 is the fourth subdivision of beat 3. But in the notation, it's easier to directly add the symbol at position 12.

Let's find the 16 16th notes (excluding separators) and place 'O' at position 12.

Original groove:
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

Counting the characters:
Line: O O O - | - - O - | O O O - | - - O O O
Indexing:
1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 | 9 10 11 12 | 13 14 15 16

So, the position 12 is the last character of the third group.

In the third group (`OOO-`), positions 9-12:
- positions 9-11: O O O
- position 12: -

To add a cymbal hit at position 12, we change the last character of that group from `-` to `O`.

S: ----|O---|----|O---

```

**The only change is the last character in the third group, changing it to `O` to place the cymbal hit on the 'a' of '1 e & a' of the second beat.**
