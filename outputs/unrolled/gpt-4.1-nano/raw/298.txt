Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** silent.
- **Snare (S):** silent.
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes on beat 2 and beat 4 ("x---" in measure 2 and 4), providing some subtle hi-hat sound.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** ghost and accented hits ("x---", "X-x-") in measures 1 and 2, giving some ride texture.

**Objective:**  
Introduce a more prominent snare pattern and add a ride cymbal, to give the groove a fuller rhythmic foundation.

### Approach:
- Keep the ghost and accent gestures on the ride cymbal.
- Add a snare hit on beat 2 of measure 1 and beat 4 of measure 3, perhaps with some ghost notes, for a more active backbeat.
- Add steady ride hits ("O---") on all four beats for a continuous ride.

### Implementation plan:
- Insert **"O---"** in the R line on all four beats.
- Add snare hits ("O--" or "O---") on beats 2 and 4 of measures 1 and 3.
- Keep existing hi-hat ghost notes for texture.

### Final groove:

K: ----|----|----|----

C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

```

**Summary:**  
- **Snare (S):** now plays on beats 2 and 4 (measures 2 and 4) to emphasize the backbeat.
- **Ride (R):** hits on all four beats ("O---" each), providing a steady ride pattern.
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes maintained for subtle texture.
- **Kick and crash:** unchanged, supporting rhythmic stability.

This creates a more complete and dynamic drum groove with emphasized backbeat and steady ride pattern, suitable for driving the song forward.
