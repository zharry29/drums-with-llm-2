Let's analyze the current groove:

- Hi-hat line: `X---|X---|X---|X---`
- The pattern shows consistent hits with `X` (hard closed) at the start of each beat, which is good for the "hard" requirement.
- The groove is already playing some closed hits but not explicitly on every 8th note, and doesn't specify open hits on up beats.

### Instructions:
- Play **closed hi-hat (X)** on **all 8th notes**.
- Open on **every up beat** (notes 2, 6, 10, 14).
- Keep hits **hard**.

### Step-by-step:

**Pattern:**
- 2: open `O` (up beat)
- 4: closed `X`
- 6: open `O`
- 8: closed `X`
- 10: open `O`
- 12: closed `X`
- 14: open `O`
- 16: closed `X`

**Final pattern:**
`-X--|-O--|-X--|-O--`

### Final drum groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: -X--|-O--|-X--|-O--
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

This maintains:
- All hits are **hard** (using `X` and `O`).
- The hi-hat hits on **every 8th note**.
- Open hits on **every up beat**.
