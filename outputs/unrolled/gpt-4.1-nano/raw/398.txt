Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': plays on beats 1 (hard 'O'), 2 (soft 'o'), and 3 (alternating 'O' and 'o').
- Snare 'S': plays on beat 2 and 4 with 'O'.
- Hi-hat 'H': plays on all four beats with alternating open and closed hits ('o', 'O', 'o', 'O', etc.).
- Toms 'T': silent.
- Cymbals 'C': plays on beat 1 ('O').
- Ride 'R': silent.

**Request:** No snare ('S') and no toms ('T').

- We'll replace the 'S' and 'T' lines with all '-' to silence them.

Now, focusing on what remains: kick, hi-hat, cymbals, and ride (which is silent).

### Final version:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This is now the groove with snare and toms removed, keeping the kick, hi-hat, and cymbal pattern.
