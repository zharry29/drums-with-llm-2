Let's analyze the existing groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays on beats 1 and 3.
- **Snare (S):** plays on beats 2 and 4, with a hit on measure 2 beat 2 and measure 4 beat 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent closed hits ("X") on all four beats.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Since the groove already has hi-hats and a straightforward pattern, the goal now is to add some toms to make the rhythm fuller, and perhaps confirm the hi-hat pattern is consistent.**

---

### Plan:
- To include the toms, add a hit at measure 3 beat 3 (say, "O").
- Slightly emphasize the hi-hat by adding some open hits ("X" or "x") on certain beats if desired, but since "X" already exists on all beats, keep it steady.

### Implementation:
- Add tom in measure 3, beat 3 ("-O--").
- Keep hi-hat consistent ("X") on every beat.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**  
- Toms added in measure 3, beat 3 ("--O-"), providing more rhythmic interest.
- Hi-hat remains uniform for driving pulse.
- The groove now contains both hi-hat and toms, enhancing the overall drum pattern while maintaining the original structure.
