Let's analyze the given groove:

- **K (Kick):** `OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO` — kick hits are many and densely spread in all four beats.
- **S (Snare):** `----|O---|----|O---` — snare only on beat 2 and 4, sparsely.
- **H (Hi-hat):** `----|----|----|----` — no hi-hat plays.
- **T (Toms):** `----|----|----|----` — no toms.
- **C (Crash):** `O---|O---|O---|O---` — crashes on every beat, which makes it very busy.
- **R (Ride):** `----|----|----|----` — no ride.

**Goal:** Reduce the amount of notes for a sparser, more minimal feel while keeping the groove recognizable.

---

### Approach:
- Keep only a few essential notes.
- Possibly retain just one or two hits per instrument for rhythmic support.
- For example:
  - Keep only one kick hit on beat 1.
  - Keep snare only on beat 3.
  - Remove all crashes to reduce busy-ness.
  - Remove hi-hat for minimalism.
  - Remove toms for simplicity.

---

### Final plan:
- **K:** Only one hit on beat 1.
- **S:** Only one hit on beat 3.
- **H:** Remove all hits.
- **C:** Remove all crash hits.
- **R:** Remove all ride hits.

### Final groove:

K: O---|----|----|----
S: ----|----|---S|----

This results in a minimalist, less notes pattern, keeping just the essential kick and snare hits for a simple rhythmic foundation.
