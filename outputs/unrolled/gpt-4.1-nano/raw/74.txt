Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on measures 1 and 3 (`O--O`, `--O-`)
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 and 4 with some open hits (`Oo-o`, `-o--`, `O--o`)
- **Hi-hats (H):** silent (`----`)
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Crash (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** plays on every beat with bell hits ("o-O-") pattern

**Current Situation:**  
The groove already has a ride cymbal pattern ("o-O-") layered, but the initial description wanted both *cymbal* (probably crash) and *ride*. The existing ride pattern is present but no crash.

### To fulfill the request:
- Add a crash cymbal to complement the ride cymbal.
- Make sure both cymbals are layered.
- Keep the rest of the groove intact.

### Plan:
- Keep the ride existing pattern.
- Add crash cymbal hits on beats 1 and 3 (`O---`) ways to enhance the impact.
- Keep the hi-hat silent (or add some if needed), but mainly focus on layering crash + ride.

### Final edited groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
@@@
```

**Explanation:**  
- The crash cymbal ("O---") is added in measure 1 and 3 to boost the impact.  
- The ride pattern remains, creating layered cymbals.  
- The existing pattern (snare, kick, ride) stays largely intact.

This provides a balanced, energetic groove with both crash and ride cymbals layered.
