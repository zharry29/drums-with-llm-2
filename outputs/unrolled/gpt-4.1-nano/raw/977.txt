Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** Plays on beat 1, beat 2, and beat 4, at the first subdivision in each (hard hits).
- **Snare (S):** Plays only on beat 3.
- **Hi-hat (H):** No hits.
- **Toms (T):** Alternating between soft and hard hits on the first three subdivisions of each beat.
- **Crash (C):** No hits.
- **Ride (R):** No hits.

Given that the request is for **less notes**, we should simplify:

- Remove the kick hits on beat 2 and beat 4, keeping only beat 1 for the kick.
- Remove all toms for a sparser pattern.
- Keep the snare only on beat 3, as it gives some rhythm.
- Keep hi-hat silent for a sparser sound.
- Remove crash and ride, since less notes is the goal.

### Final plan:
- **K:** Only on beat 1.
- **S:** Only on beat 3.
- **H:** No hits.
- **T:** None.
- **C & R:** None.

This reduces the pattern to just a kick on the first beat and a snare on the third beat, creating a very simple, less-notes rhythm.
