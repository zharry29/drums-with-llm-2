Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** heavy hits on all beats, squeezing in hits on beat 1 and 3, with some softer hits on beat 2 and 4.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 of measure 2 and beat 4 of measure 4, aligning with usual backbeat.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent, no notes.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on beat 1 of each measure, which adds some accent.
- **Ride cymbal (R):** silent.

The user wants to add more cymbals beyond just the crash on beat 1, so hereâ€™s a plan:

### Plan:
- Add crash cymbals ("O") at beat 3 of measures 1 and 3 for more emphasis.
- Optionally, incorporate ride cymbal hits ("O" perhaps on key off-beats for a flowing pattern), but considering the existing cymbals, a good start is adding crashes at strong downbeats for punch.

### Finalized approach:
- Place crash cymbals on beat 1 of measure 1 and beat 3 of measure 3.
- Keep the existing kick and snare pattern.
- Maintain the stille existing crash hits to keep rhythmic clarity.

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This provides stronger emphasis on "crash" hits at key moments, making the groove more dynamic and exciting.
