Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays in various patterns, including hard hits at different times.
- Snare (S): plays on beats 2 and 4 with different articulations.
- Hi-hat (H): silent.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C): plays on every beat with hard hits.
- Ride (R): silent.

**Request:** no toms and no kick.

This means:

- Remove the K line entirely.
- Keep snare, hi-hat, cymbals, and ride (if any). Since in the current groove, only snare and cymbals are active with no ride, we'll adjust accordingly.

**Approach:**

- Keep the snare pattern, which accentuates beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the cymbal hits on every beat (since the original has cymbals at every beat).
- Add hi-hat for rhythm texture.
- Remove the kick line.

**Final decision:**

- Keep the snare with hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep cymbals on beats 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Add steady hi-hat pattern throughout.
- Remove the kick line.

This pattern provides a consistent rhythmic backbone with snare emphasizing the backbeat, hi-hat giving pulse, and cymbals accenting every beat, with no kick or toms, per the request.
