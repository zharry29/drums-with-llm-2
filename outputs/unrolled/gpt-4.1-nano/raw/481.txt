Since the request is to eliminate all kick (K) and hi-hat (H), I will remove those lines entirely. The remaining instruments are snare (S), toms (T), cymbals (C), and ride (R).

Analyzing the original groove:
- K (kick): plays at certain points, which we will remove.
- S (snare): plays on measure 2 (beat 2, with open and closed hits), and partially on measures 3 and 4.
- H (hihat): no activity, so removing it makes no difference.
- T (toms): no activity.
- C (cymbal): no activity.
- R (ride): plays on all beats with alternations of open (O) and closed (o) hits.

To keep some rhythmic interest without kick and hi-hat, I will:
- Remove the K and H lines.
- Retain the snare hits, which give a backbeat, especially on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the ride pattern because it maintains a rhythmic pulse.

### Final plan:
- Keep S (snare) and R (ride) as in the original, but only the parts that provide rhythm.
- Remove K and H entirely.

### Final groove:

```plaintext
K: (removed)
S: ----|--O-|--o-|O---
H: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
```

This pattern emphasizes the ride cymbal and snare, providing a steady rhythm without kick or hi-hat.
