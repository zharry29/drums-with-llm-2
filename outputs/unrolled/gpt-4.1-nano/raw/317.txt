Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 ("O---") and beat 3 ("O---").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 ("O---") and 4 ("O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistently plays closed hi-hat hits ("X---" on each beat).
- **Toms, Crash, Ride:** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add more kick activity to support the groove, especially on beats 2 and 4, complementing the snare hits.

### Thought process:
- The kick is currently only on beats 1 and 3, so adding soft kicks ("o") on beats 2 and 4 would thicken the pattern.
- Keep existing kicks (on beats 1 and 3) for a solid foundation.
- For variation, add soft kicks (o) on beats 2 and 4.

### Final plan:
- Keep the original kick hits.
- Add soft kicks ("o") on beats 2 and 4.

S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----

This configuration strengthens the overall groove by reinforcing all four beats with kick patterns, maintaining rhythmic consistency and adding smooth support to the snare hits.
