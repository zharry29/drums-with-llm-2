**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O--- | O--- | ---- | O---`
  - Snare (S): `---- | ---- | O--- | ----`
  - Hi-hat (H): `---- | ---- | ---- | ----`
  - Toms (T): `O-o- | O-o- | O-o- | O-o-` (various soft hits)
  - Crash (C): all rests
  - Ride (R): all rests

- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and hi-hat in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - For the first beat:
    - Keep the kick as `O---`.
    - Add a tom hit: T in first beat from `O-o-` to `-O--` (a tom hit on the second subdivision).
    - Add a hi-hat hit: H in first beat from `----` to `x---` (a closed hi-hat strike at the start).
