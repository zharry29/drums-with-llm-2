Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beat 1, 2, and 4, with varying intensity.
- Snare (S): hits on beat 3.
- Hi-hat (H): no hits.
- Toms (T): plays a pattern with soft and hard hits evenly across all four beats.
- Cymbals (C): none.
- Ride (R): none.

**Request:** no hi-hat or snare.

That means we need to eliminate H and S. The rest (K, T, C, R) either are empty or not relevant, but T and R are empty in the original, so they can be removed.

### Final plan:
- Keep only K and T for a rhythm pattern.
- Since T is playing a pattern, we'll retain T's pattern.
- Remove S, H, C, R.

### The resulting groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
S: (removed)
H: (removed)
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This produces a simple pattern with the kick and toms, no snare or hi-hat, fulfilling your request.
