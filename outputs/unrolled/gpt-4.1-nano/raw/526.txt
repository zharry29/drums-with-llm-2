The instructions are to remove all Toms (T) and Hi-Hat (H) lines.  
- Remove the T line: `----|----|----|----`  
- Remove the H line: `--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`  

Remaining instruments:
- K (kick): `O---|---o|O-O-|-` (keep)
- S (snare): `----|O---|----|O---` (keep)
- R (ride): `----|----|----|----` (remove, since it's empty)

Since the ride is not contributing, I will keep the kick and snare, which provide the main rhythm.

**Final edited groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---

This removes all toms and hi-hat, focusing on kick and snare for a clean rhythm.
