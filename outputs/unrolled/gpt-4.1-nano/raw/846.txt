**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `o---`, `--o-`, `o---`, `--o-`
  - Snare (S): `----`, `X---`, `--X-`, `----`
  - Hi-hat (H): `----`, `x---`, `----`, `x---`
  - Toms (T): all rests
  - Crash (C): all rests
  - Ride (R): `x---`, `X-x-`, `x---`, `X-x-`

- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and a hi-hat sound at the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - For the first beat:
    - Keep the kick as `o---`
    - Change the first beat of T (Toms) to include a hit, for example, `-O--` (tom hit on the second note)
    - Change the first beat of H (Hi-hat) to include a hit, for example, `x---` (already has a hi-hat hit on second subdivision, but to emphasize the beginning, add a hit at the first subdivision: `x---` is already suitable)

- To be more explicit:
  - Let's add a tom hit in the first beat: change T from `----` to `-O--`.
  - For the hi-hat, keep it as `x---` in the first beat, which is already a hit at the start.

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: x---|x---|----|x---
T: -O--|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**This adds a tom hit and a hi-hat in the very beginning as requested.**
