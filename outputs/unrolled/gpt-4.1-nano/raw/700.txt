**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `O---` to `O---` â€” no change needed if already a kick.
- The first beat of K is `O---`, so a kick is already present in the first beat, which works.
- To add a hi-hat in the very beginning, change the first beat of H from `--o-` to `x---` (soft closed hi-hat).
- Keep other parts unchanged.

**Implementation:**

- K: retain `O---`
- H: from `--o-` to `x---`

---

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Now, the first beat includes both a kick and a hi-hat, fulfilling the request.
