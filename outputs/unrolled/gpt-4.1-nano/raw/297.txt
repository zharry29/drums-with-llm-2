Let's analyze the current groove and the edit request:

**Current groove:**
- K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
- S: ----|O---|----|O---
- H: ----|----|----|----
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: O---|O---|O---|O---
- R: ----|----|----|----

**Edit request:**  
- Add a snare (S) to the groove (it's already there, but maybe more prominent or with a different pattern).  
- Add a ride cymbal (R) to the groove.

**Thought process:**  
- The snare is already present, but only on beat 2 of measure 2 and beat 4 of measure 4. To create more groove vitality, I will distribute the snare hits more evenly or add accents.  
- For the ride cymbal, I will add a pattern that plays on the main beats (1, 2, 3, 4), perhaps hitting on the downbeat of each measure, or alternatively more rhythmically interesting, like steady eighths or quarter notes.

**Implementation plan:**
- Keep the existing kick pattern, adding ride hits on the main beats.  
- For the ride, place hits on the first 16th note of beats 1 and 3 (to give a steady pulse) or on all downbeats.

Iâ€™ll choose to add ride hits on the first 16th note of each beat: notes 1, 5, 9, 13. For visual clarity, I will set 'R' at those positions in each measure, possibly replacing or layering with hi-hat if necessary.

Also, make the snare pattern a bit more lively by placing it on 2 and 4 beats consistently.

Here's a proposed new groove:

- Snare: on beats 2 and 4 of each measure (more consistent).
- Ride: on beats 1 and 3 (downbeats), and perhaps on the "and" of beat 2 or 4 for a bit of swing.

Simplify to:
- Ride hits on beat 1 (note 1), beat 3 (note 9).
- Snare hits on beats 2 and 4 (notes 5 and 13 in each measure).

Now, constructing notation:

Measure 1:
- K: O O O - | - - O - | O O O - | - - -
- S: - - - - | - - - - | - - - - | - - - -
- H: can remain as is, or add some hi-hat if desired.
- R: R - - - | R - - - | R - - - | R - - -
- Snare (S): - - - - | - O - - | - - - - | - - O -

Similarly for other measures, adding the same pattern.

Final notation:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|--O-|----|--O-
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: R---|R---|R---|R---

In this version:
- The ride cymbal hits on the first 16th note of beats 1 and 3 (R).
- The snare emphasizes beats 2 and 4 (with 'O').
- Kick remains as in the original, with some variation.
- Hi-hat and Toms are untouched, but can be adjusted as desired.

This enhances the groove with more cymbal activity and a stronger backbeat, aligning with the edit request.
