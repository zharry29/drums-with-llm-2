Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': plays on beats 1 and 3 with hard hits ('O') in bars 1 and 3.
- Snare 'S': plays on beat 2 with mixed strong and soft hits, plus hits on beat 4 with similar pattern.
- Hi-hat 'H': silent.
- Toms 'T' and cymbals 'C': silent.
- Ride 'R': alternating soft and hard closed hits ('o' and 'O') on beats 1, 2, 3, 4, giving a rhythmic pattern.

**Goal:** Add some ride cymbal hits to enrich the groove. The 'R' line already has a pattern, but it's alternating on every beat, which can be emphasized or enhanced.

**Approach:**  
- Add more ride cymbal hits vaguely on beats 2 and 4, probably layering with the existing pattern.
- Or, strengthen the ride pattern by adding open bell hits ('O') on beats 2 and 4 for a splash of brightness.

Since the existing 'R' line has alternating 'o' and 'O' on each beat, adding some stronger hits on specific beats can brighten the sound.

Let's add an open bell hit ('O') on beat 2 and beat 4 (on the second and fourth beat positions) to make the ride more prominent.

**Implementation:**
- On beat 2, change 'o-O-' to 'O-O-'. That is, replace the 'o' with 'O' on beat 2.
- On beat 4, do the sameâ€”change 'o-O-' to 'O-O-'.

The lines would look like this:

- Before: `o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-`
- After:  `o- O-|o- O-|o- O-|o- O-` (adding an 'O' on beat 2 and 4).

However, to keep rhythm consistent and avoid overlapping, better to just explicitly add 'O' on beat 2 and beat 4, leaving the other beats unchanged.

### Final plan:
- For beat 2 and beat 4, change one of the 'o' or 'O' to 'O' for emphasis.
- For aesthetic, I will adjust the pattern to have open bell hits ('O') at beats 2 and 4 on the ride line, while keeping the pattern intact.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-

This now has more prominent ride cymbal hits on beats 2 and 4, adding brightness and a shimmering effect to the groove.
