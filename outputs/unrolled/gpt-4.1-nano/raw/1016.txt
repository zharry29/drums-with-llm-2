Let's analyze the current groove:

- The Toms are silent (`----|----|----|----`), so to increase dynamism, we should add a lively tom pattern.
- The rest of the groove has some variation in kick and snare, with consistent cymbal hits.

**Objective:**  
Enhance the Toms pattern to make it more dynamic while maintaining their placement on all beats.

---

### Thought process:
1. Keep all four beats active with Toms.
2. Use accents (`X`, `O`) and softer hits (`x`, `o`) to add variation.
3. Create a pattern that alternates between stronger and softer hits, possibly with off-beat accents for added movement.

### Proposed Tom pattern:
- Beat 1: strong downbeat (`X---`)
- Beat 2: softer, off-beat hit (`--o-`)
- Beat 3: accented (`O---`)
- Beat 4: softer off-beat (`--o-`)

### Final chosen pattern:
`X---|--o-|O---|--o-`

### Final groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: X---|--o-|O---|--o-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds expressive variation to the Toms, making the groove more dynamic and lively while keeping the same placement.
