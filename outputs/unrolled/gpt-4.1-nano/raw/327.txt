Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': O---|----|O---|----
  - Kick hits on measure 1 beat 1, and measure 3 beat 1.
- Snare 'S': ----|O---|----|O---
  - Snare hits on measure 2 beat 2 and measure 4 beat 4, but per instruction, we will remove snare.
- Hi-hat 'H': X---|X---|X---|X---
  - Steady closed hi-hat on all four beats, providing rhythm.
- Toms 'T' and Cymbals 'C': none.
- Ride cymbal 'R': none.

### Objective:
- Remove snare 'S' and any ride cymbal 'R' if present.
- Keep the hi-hat for rhythm.
- Enhance the kick pattern for more drive, possibly making it steady on every beat or every other beat.

### Approach:
- Make the kick hit on every beat (every four 16th notes).
- Keep hi-hat pattern as is.
- Remove snare and ride.

### Implementation:
- Let's have the kick with a hard hit in each beat (represented as 'O').
- Keep the hi-hat unchanged.

K: O---|O---|O---|O---
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This pattern provides a steady, driving rhythm with consistent kick hits on each beat, supported by the hi-hat, and no snare or ride cymbal.
