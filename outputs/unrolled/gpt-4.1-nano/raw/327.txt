Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 ("O---") and 3 ("O---").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 ("O---" and "O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays on all beats with consistent closed hits ("X---", "X---", etc.).
- **Toms, cymbals (C, R):** silent.

**New instructions:**  
- Remove snare (S) and ride cymbal (R).  

**What stays:**  
- Kick and hi-hat are important for the rhythm, so I will keep both.

**Goal:**  
- Keep a simple, steady groove with kick and hi-hat, no snare or ride.

---

### Final plan:
- Remove S and R lines entirely.
- Keep kicks on beats 1 and 3.
- Keep hi-hat pattern consistent.

### Final groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This creates a straightforward, steady rhythm with the kick emphasizing the downbeats and hi-hat providing pacing, perfectly aligned with your instruction of removing snare and ride cymbal.
