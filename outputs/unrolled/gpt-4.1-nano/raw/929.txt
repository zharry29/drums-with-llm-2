Let's analyze the groove and identify the snare hits in beat 4:

- Snare line (S):
  - Pattern: ----|O---|----|O---
  - Beat 4: O---

There is a snare hit at the very start of beat 4. Since the instruction is to avoid snare on beat 4, we need to remove or silence this hit.

- Change "O---" in beat 4 to "----".

Other instruments are already compliant.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|----
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This accomplishes the request by removing the snare hit on beat 4.
