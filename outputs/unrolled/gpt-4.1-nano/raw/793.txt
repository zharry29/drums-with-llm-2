**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits on the first, second, third, and last beats with various intensities
  - Snare (S): hits on the second beat and last
  - Hi-hat (H): silent
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): on first beat
  - Ride (R): silent

- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and a ride in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - Add a tom hit (`O`) at the very first subdivision in T.
  - Add a ride hit (`O`) at the very first subdivision in R.

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|----|----|----

**This adds a tom hit and a ride hit at the very beginning, as requested.**
