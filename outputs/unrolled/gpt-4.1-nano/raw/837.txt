**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): all rests (`----`)
  - Snare (S): all rests (`----`)
  - Hi-hat (H): rests except on beat 2 and 4 (`x---`, `x---`)
  - Toms (T): all rests
  - Crash cymbal (C): all rests
  - Ride cymbal (R): pattern with closed and open hits

- Request:
  - Add a kick hit and cymbal in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Change the first beat of K from `----` to `O---` or a softer `o---` to add a kick
  - Add a cymbal hit in the first beat (the first subdivision of the first beat). Since the cymbal is not in the original, I will add a crash cymbal hit `O` or `X` at the start within the first beat.

- To keep the pattern clear, I will set:
  - Kick: `O---` (hard kick at the start)
  - Crash cymbal: `O---` (hard crash at the start)

- For other instruments, leave as is.

K: O---|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**This adds a kick and crash cymbal at the very beginning as per the request, with the rest of the pattern unchanged.**
