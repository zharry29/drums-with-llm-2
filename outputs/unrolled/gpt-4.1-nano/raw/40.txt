Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': strong hits on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Snare 'S': hits on beat 2 and 4 with 'O'.
- Hi-hat 'H': silent.
- Toms 'T': silent.
- Cymbals 'C': hits on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4 with 'O'.
- Ride 'R': silent.

**Request:** Add ride cymbal hits to the groove.

Looking at the typical placement, the ride cymbal often complements the hi-hat pattern or accents specific beats. Since the hi-hat is silenced, adding some ride hits can introduce more shimmer and rhythm.

Let's add ride 'R' hits on beats 2 and 4, matching the snare placement for emphasis, and optionally add one on beat 1 to balance.

- assign 'O' in 'R' on the second beat (character 5) and fourth beat (character 17).

We'll put 'O's at beats 2 and 4, perhaps also adding a hit on beat 1 for variety.

Here's the planned updated groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|--O-|----|--O-

This will add ride hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 to enrich the rhythm texture.
