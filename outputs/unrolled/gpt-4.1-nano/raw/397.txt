Let's examine the current groove:

- Kick 'K': no hits.
- Snare 'S': no hits.
- Hi-hat 'H': plays on beat 2 and 4 with soft closed hits ('x').
- Toms 'T': no hits.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': 'R' has hits on all beats with alternating 'x' and 'X'; 'C' is silent.

**Request:** Remove all snare ('S') and toms ('T').

- Replace 'S' and 'T' lines with all dashes.

Remaining instruments are hi-hat, cymbals, and kick (which has no hits). Since the kick is silent, the groove now relies on hi-hat and cymbals for rhythm.

### Final version:

This is the groove with snare and toms removed, focusing on hi-hat, cymbals, and the remaining ride pattern.
