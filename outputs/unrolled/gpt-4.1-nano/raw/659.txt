**Thought process:**

- To add a snare hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of S from `----` to `S---` (a snare hit at the first beat).
- To add a cymbal at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---` (a cymbal hit).

Since the first beat of C is already `O---`, I will leave it as is.  
The only change needed is the snare hit at the start.

---

**Implementation:**

- S: `S---`
- C: `O---` (unchanged)

---

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: S---|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This now has a snare hit in the very beginning while keeping the cymbal as it was.
