Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': plays hard hits in various patterns.
- Snare 'S': hits on beats 2 and 4 with the second beat in the second and last measures.
- Hi-hat 'H': no hits.
- Toms 'T': no hits.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': both play on every beat they are present.

**Request:** Remove all cymbals and ride hits (the 'C' and 'R' lines).

Since 'C' and 'R' are present, the simplest approach is to remove their hits or omit those lines entirely.

### Approach:
- Remove 'C' and 'R' lines or set all their characters to '-'.

To keep a consistent format, I will set all 'C' and 'R' line characters to '-' to indicate no hits.

### Final version:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This version has no cymbal or ride hits, fulfilling the request, and maintains the rhythmic structure with kick, snare, and hi-hat.
