Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** Has hits on beat 1 (hard), beat 3 (hard), and beat 4 (hard). Fairly active but somewhat minimal.
- **Snare (S):** Hits on beats 2 and 4, with some open and closed hits, adding rhythmic variety.
- **Hi-Hat (H):** No hits.
- **Toms (T):** No hits.
- **Crash (C):** No hits.
- **Ride (R):** Alternates with soft and hard hits on all four beats, making it quite busy and filling.

**Goal:** Reduce the number of notes for a more minimal feel, keeping the core groove intact.

### Approach:
- Keep the kick on beats 1 and 3.
- Keep the snare on beats 2 and 4, but simplify by removing some open/closed accents.
- Remove hi-hat, toms, crash, and reduce ride activity.
- Possibly keep just a basic ride pattern if needed, but since we want fewer notes, better to remove it.

### Simplify step-by-step:
- Remove hi-hat and toms for minimalism.
- Keep the kick on beats 1 and 3.
- Keep the snare only on beats 2 and 4 with no extra open/closed variations.
- Remove the ride to make it cleaner.

This pattern retains the basic upbeat and downbeat feel with less complexity, improving clarity and feel while reducing notes.
