**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): plays on 1st and 3rd beats
  - Snare (S): plays on 2nd and 4th beats
  - Hi-hat (H): consistent playing on every 16th note
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): silent

- Request:
  - Add a cymbal hit and a ride cymbal in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - Add crash cymbal (`O`) in C line at first beat.
  - Add ride cymbal (`O`) in R line at first beat.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

**Result:**
- Crash cymbal (`O`) and ride cymbal (`O`) are added at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
