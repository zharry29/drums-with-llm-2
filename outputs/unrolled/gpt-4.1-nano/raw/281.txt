Let's analyze the current pattern:

- **Kick (K):** hits on 1, and slight soft hit on beat 2 (“---o”), and on beat 3 ("O-O-").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 and 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** variation with ghost notes and accents on beats 2 and 3.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** hits on beat 1.
- **Ride (R):** currently silent.

**Objective:**  
Add a ride cymbal pattern to complement the snare and create a fuller rhythmic texture, especially supporting the backbeat.

### Approach:
- Introduce ride pattern on beats 2 and 4 (a common pattern).
- Keep the existing kick and snare for rhythm stability.
- Preserve hi-hat ghost notes for subtle drive.

### Implementation:
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep existing kick pattern.
- Keep snare pattern.
- Keep hi-hat ghost notes.

### Final groove:

```

**Summary:**  
- Ride cymbal added on beats 2 and 4 ("O---") in the ride line.
- Retained the existing kick, snare, and hi-hat ghost notes.
- The groove now includes both snare and ride, creating a richer rhythmic background suitable for many styles.
