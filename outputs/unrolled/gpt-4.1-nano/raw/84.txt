Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits mainly on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4 with varying intensity.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 measure 2 and beat 4 measure 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** hits on every beat in all measures.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### Objective:
Add a tom pattern to enrich the rhythm and color of the groove, complementing the existing cymbals.

### Approach:
- Place a tom hit ("O") in measure 1 or 3 at a strategic subdivision, such as subdivision 6 or 14.
- For balance, add a tom hit in measure 1 at subdivision 6.
- Possibly add another in measure 3 at subdivision 14.

### Final plan:
- In measure 1, add a tom at subdivision 6 ("--O-").
- In measure 3, add a tom at subdivision 14 ("-----O").

**Summary:**
- Added a tom in measure 1 at subdivision 6.
- Added a tom in measure 3 at subdivision 14.
- Keeps the existing bass and cymbal pattern, with the new toms providing extra rhythmic layers.
