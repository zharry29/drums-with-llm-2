Since the request is to remove all kick (K) and hi-hat (H), I will delete those lines entirely. The remaining instruments are snare (S), Toms (T), Cymbal (C), and Ride (R).

Original groove:
- K (kick): plays at the start of beat 1, a soft hit at beat 2, and parts of beat 3.
- S (snare): beats 2 and 4.
- H (hihat): plays on all beats with alternating open and closed hits.
- T (toms): silent.
- C (cymbal): plays at beat 1.
- R (ride): silent.

**Removing kick and hihat lines:**
- Remove K and H lines.
- Keep S, C, R, T (though T is silent here).

I want to keep a rhythmic pulse with cymbal and snare, simplifying the groove.

### Final pattern:
- Keep S with hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Use C on beat 1 for emphasis.
- Leave T and R silent for simplicity.

### Final drum groove:

K: (removed)
S: ----|--O-|----|O---
H: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This provides a straightforward rhythm with a snare on beats 2 and 4 and cymbal at the start, fulfilling the request.

**Final answer:**
