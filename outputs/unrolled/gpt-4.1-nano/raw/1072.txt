Let's analyze the current groove:

- The **kick** (`K`) plays soft hits (`o`) on the first and third subdivisions, providing a subtle rhythmic pulse.
- The **snare** (`S`) is silent, so this is a good candidate for adding ghost notes.
- The **hi-hat** (`H`) plays soft closed hits (`x`) on the second and fourth beats.
- The **toms** (`T`) are silent.
- The **cymbals** (`C`) are silent.
- The **ride** (`R`) features ghost notes (`x`, `X-x`), giving it a busy, textural feel.

**Objective:**  
Add ghost notes to the snare to increase groove complexity, complementing the ghost notes in the ride, and making the overall pattern more lively.

### Thought process:
- Existing ghost notes in `R` are spread out; adding snare ghost notes in between will enhance the groove.
- Since main snare hits are absent, we can introduce ghost notes (`o`) on off-beats and in between existing rhythm.

### Implementation plan:
- Place ghost notes (`o`) in the snare on the off-beats, especially just before or after the main hits.
- For balance, add ghost hits on beat 2 and 4 in the second and third measures.

**Summary:**
- Ghost notes (`o`) added to the snare pattern on off-beats and between main hits.
- Creates a more dynamic rhythmic feel and enhances overall groove complexity while keeping the original feel intact.
- Complements existing ghost notes in the ride cymbal pattern.
