**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `O--O` to `O---` (a single, prominent kick).
- To add a hi-hat hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of H from `X-x-` to `x-x-` (soft closed hi-hat, same pattern, but softer).
- Keep the rest unchanged to preserve the original groove.

---

**Final steps:**

- K: from `O--O` to `O---`
- H: from `X-x-` to `x-x-`

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: x-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Now, the very first beat includes both the kick and hi-hat as requested.
