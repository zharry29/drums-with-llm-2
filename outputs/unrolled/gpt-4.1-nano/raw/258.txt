Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 ("o---") and beat 3 ("o---") with soft hits
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("X---") and beat 3 ("--X-")
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes on beat 2 ("x---") and beat 4 ("x---")
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** pattern with hits on beat 1 ("x---"), beat 2 ("X-x-"), beat 3 ("x---"), beat 4 ("X-x-") â€” so there's a rhythmic ride pattern already present but the way it's arranged isn't prominent in the groove, since it overlaps with other cymbals or there's no explicit emphasis.

### Objective:
To emphasize the ride cymbal more, adding distinct ride hits on beats 2 and 4, possibly with strong patterning, while preserving the ghosted hi-hat and the kick/snare pattern.

---

### Approach:
- Add explicit ride hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the existing ghost notes on hi-hat.
- Possibly, slightly reduce or offset the existing ride pattern to make it stand out.

### Implementation:
- Place "O---" for the ride on beat 2 and beat 4.
- Maintain existing ghosted hi-hat notes.
- Keep the kick and snare as is.

---

### Final pattern:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

```

### Explanation:
- Ride cymbal hits ("O---") are now explicitly on beats 2 and 4, making the ride rhythm more prominent.
- Ghosted hi-hat remains for subtle texture.
- The overall groove now has clear ride support along with kick and snare, suitable for a steady groove with ride emphasis.
