Let's analyze the current groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-  
S: ----|----|S---|----  
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-  
T: ----|----|---O|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

The snare (S) is currently on:
- Measure 3, beat 1: "S---"
- No snare on measure 1 or 2, and none on beats 2 or 4.

The user wants to avoid having snare on the downbeat of 2 and 4,
which correspond to the first notes of measure 2 and measure 4.

Currently:
- Measure 2: no snare — already okay.
- Measure 4: no snare — already okay.
- Measure 3: snare is on beat 1, which is fine.
- Measure 1: no snare at all.

Actually, in this groove, there are no snares on the second and fourth downbeats.

However, if in case there had been a snare on the downbeats of measure 2 or 4, or if we want to make sure there's no snare exactly on beat 2 and 4 (the downbeats of those measures), then we should remove or shift any snare hits on those specific downbeats.

Suppose there's a snare on beat 2 or 4 in measure 2 or 4; then we would remove or move it.

In this current groove:
- Measure 2 has no snare.
- Measure 4 has no snare.

So overall, the groove already satisfies the condition.

To reinforce this, I will make sure there are absolutely no snare hits on beat 2 and 4 downbeats, and possibly add variation or pattern.

Final modification idea:
- Keep existing snare pattern.
- For clarity, remove any potential snare hits on beat 2 and 4 in measures 2 and 4 if there are any.

Given the initial, the safest and simplest is to leave it as is, confirming no snares on downbeats 2 and 4.

**Final answer:**

This version already avoids snare on downbeats 2 and 4 (beats 2 and 4 of measures 2 and 4).
