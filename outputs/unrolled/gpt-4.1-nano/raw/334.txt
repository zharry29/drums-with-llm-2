Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays on beats 1 ("O--O") and 3 ("--O-")
- **Snare (S):** plays on beats 2 and 4 with "Oo-o" and "O--o"
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays a steady pattern ("X-x-")
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** silent

---

### New instructions:
- Remove hi-hat and toms.

### Approach:
- Remove the H and T lines.
- Keep the kick and snare lines as is.
- As the hi-hat is removed, and the user requested only kick and snare, I will keep the groove tight with just those instruments.

### Final plan:
- Keep the same kick pattern.
- Keep the same snare.
- Remove H and T.

### Final groove:

This simplifies the groove to just kick and snare, fulfilling your request to eliminate the hi-hat and toms, while maintaining the rhythm and groove.
