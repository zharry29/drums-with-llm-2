Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4 with varying intensity.
- **Snare (S):** on beat 2 and 4, with hits on beat 2 (O) and beat 4 (O).
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** hits on every beat ("O---"), consistent for emphasis.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### Goal:
Add a ride cymbal to complement the existing drum pattern, supporting the groove by enriching the cymbals.

### Approach:
- Introduce ride hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4 for rhythmic support.
- Keep the existing kick, snare, and crash pattern.
- You can replace or add to the crash if needed, but since crash hits are already on all beats, we can add ride without issue.

### Implementation:
- Insert "O---" in the R line on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep existing instrument patterns.

### Final groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|O---|----|O---

**Explanation:**
- Added ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- The rest remains unchanged, preserving the groove's energy with added cymbal texture for more rhythmic fullness.
