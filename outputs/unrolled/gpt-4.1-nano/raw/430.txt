Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays on beat 1 (hard) and beat 3 (soft).
- Snare (S): plays on beats 2 and 4, with various articulations.
- Hi-hat (H): silent.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C): silent.
- Ride (R): plays on all four beats with alternating open/closed hits.

**Request:** no toms and no kick.

Since the original groove already has no T and only some K hits, I will remove the kick line entirely and keep the rest. To keep some rhythmic interest, I will keep the snare and ride cymbals. The snare has interesting hits on beats 2 and 4, and the ride cymbal is active on all beats with alternating open/closed hits.

I will:

- Remove the K line.
- Keep S and R.
- To enhance rhythm, I will also keep the Ride cymbal pattern.
- Keep the snare hits on beats 2 and 4, with some articulation.
- Keep the ride pattern, maintaining rhythm.

S: ----|---o|----|---O
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
C: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
K: (removed)
T: (removed)

This provides an interesting rhythm with snare on beats 2 and 4, and the ride cymbal contributing a steady pattern, with no kick or toms, fulfilling the request.
