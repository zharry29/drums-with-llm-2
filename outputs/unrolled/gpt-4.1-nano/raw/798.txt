**Thought process:**

- Original groove features:
  - Kick (K): soft hits (`o`) on the first and second subdivisions of the first beat, and on the second beat
  - Snare (S): hits at second and third subdivisions in the second beat
  - Hi-hat (H): closed hits on the second and fourth subdivisions
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): mix of open and closed hits, with x's on the second beat
  
- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and a ride in the very beginning.
  
- Implementation:
  - Add a tom hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in T.
  - Add a ride hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in R.
