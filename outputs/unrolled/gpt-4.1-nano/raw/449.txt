Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 with high and soft hits.
- Snare (S): hits on beat 3, no other hits.
- Hi-hat (H): no hits.
- Toms (T): plays on every beat with alternating soft and hard hits.
- Cymbals (C): no hits.
- Ride (R): no hits.

**Request:** No cymbal or snare.

This means:

- Remove snare (S) and cymbal (C) lines.
- Keep kick (K) as it provides the foundational rhythm.
- Keep the toms (T), since they are not cymbals or snare but still percussion, and they add interest.
- Hi-hat (H): no hits, so it can be omitted unless desired for further rhythm.
- Ride (R): already no hits, so no change needed.

### Final plan:

- Keep the kick (K) as is.
- Keep the toms (T) as they add rhythm.
- Remove snare (S) and cymbals (C).

### Final groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: (removed)
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This results in a simple, driving rhythm with just kick and tomsâ€”matching the request to exclude snare and cymbals.
