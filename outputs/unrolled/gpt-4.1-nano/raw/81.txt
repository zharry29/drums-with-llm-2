Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1, 2, and 4, some soft hits.
- **Snare (S):** only in measure 3, on beat 1.
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent closed hits ("x-x-").
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** hits on every beat.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add a tom pattern (T) that complements the groove. The groove currently has a tom hit in measure 3 on beat 3 ("---O"). To better highlight toms, we can:

- Add more tom hits, e.g., in measures 1 and 4.
- Sync the tom hits with the kick or snare pattern to add rhythmic interest.

**Approach:**
- Add tom hits ("O") in measures 1 and 4, perhaps on some off-beats, like subdivisions 6 and 14.
- Keep existing elements intact for flow.

---

### Final planned pattern:

- In measure 1: add a tom hit around subdivision 6.
- In measure 4: add a tom hit on subdivision 14.
- Keep the existing tom hit in measure 3.

### Final groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: --O-|----|---O|--O-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

```

**Details:**
- Added a tom hit ("O") in measure 1 on subdivision 6.
- Added a tom hit ("O") in measure 4 on subdivision 14.
- The existing tom in measure 3 remains to keep the pattern balanced.
- The groove now incorporates a fresh tom layer for added rhythmic interest while respecting the original feel.
