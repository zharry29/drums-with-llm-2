Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits at the start ("O") of measure 1 and 3.
- **Snare (S):** hits in measure 2 on beat 2 (with mixed open and closed hits) and measure 4 on beat 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent steady "X-x-" pattern in all measures.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### Objective:
Add toms (T) along with cymbals (C) to enrich the pattern.  
Since cymbals are not present in the original groove, we'll add ride cymbal hits ("R" line) along with a tom pattern ("T" line). Typically, cymbals and ride are played on beats or off-beats, and toms can be placed at rhythmically interesting points.

### Plan:
- Add a tom hit ("O") in measure 2 at subdivision 6 for a fill.
- Add a tom hit ("O") in measure 4 at subdivision 14 for variation.
- Add a ride cymbal hit ("R") in measure 2 and 4 at subdivisions aligning with the fills, e.g., measure 2 at subdivision 6, measure 4 at subdivision 14.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|--O-|----|-----O
C: ----|--R-|----|--R-
R: ----|--R-|----|--R-

```

**Explanation:**
- T: Added in measure 2 at subdivision 6 and in measure 4 at subdivision 14.
- R: Added ride cymbal hits in measure 2 and measure 4 at the same subdivisions for accentuation.
- Keeps the groove lively with cymbals and toms alongside the consistent hi-hat and snare patterns.

This provides a rhythmic fill and layered cymbals, fulfilling the requirement of adding both cymbals and toms.
