To implement the request:

- Play **closed hi-hat** on **all 16th notes**. For closed hi-hat, `x` (soft) and `X` (hard) are used.
- **Accent the downbeats** at positions 1, 5, 9, 13 with a louder hit (`X`) to give emphasis.
- Remaining hi-hat notes will be `x`.

Now, to construct the pattern:

- Positions 1, 5, 9, 13: `X`
- All other positions: `x`

Resulting pattern:
`Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx`

This pattern provides continuous, accented closed hi-hat hits on all 16th notes with emphasis on the down beats for a strong rhythmic pulse.
