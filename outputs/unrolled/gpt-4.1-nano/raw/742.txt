**Thought process:**

- The original groove has:
  - No snare (S) in the first beat (`----`)
  - No cymbal (C) in the first beat (`----`)
- The request is to add both a cymbal hit and a snare in the very beginning.
- For the snare (S), change the first beat from `----` to `O---`.
- For the cymbal (C), change the first beat from `----` to `O---`.
- The rest of the groove remains unchanged.

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: O---|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

**Outcome:**
- Both the snare and cymbal are now played in the very first beat, fulfilling the request.
