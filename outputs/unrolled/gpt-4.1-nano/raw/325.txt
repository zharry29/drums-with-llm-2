Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': O---|---o|O-O-|----
  - Kick hits on:
    - measure 1: beat 1 (O)
    - measure 2: beat 4 (o)
    - measure 3: beats 1 and 3 (O and O)
- Snare 'S': ----|O---|----|O---
  - Snare hits on measure 2, beat 1 and measure 4, beat 4.
- Hi-hat 'H': --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
  - Hi-hat pattern, alternating open and closed hits.
- Toms 'T', Cymbals 'C', Ride 'R': None.

### New goal:
Remove all snare and ride cymbal hits, focus on creating a groove with kick and hi-hat only.

### Approach:
- Keep the kick pattern, but make it more consistent and driving.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern.
- Remove the snare 'S' and ride 'R'.

### Implementation:
- Make the kick hit on all beats for a steady pulse.
- Keep hi-hat pattern as is.
- Remove snare and ride.
