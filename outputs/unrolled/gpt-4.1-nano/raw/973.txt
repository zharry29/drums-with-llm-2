Let's analyze the current groove:

- **K (Kick):** `O---|---o|O-O-|----`  
  - Kick on beats 1, 3, and 2(last subdivision), with a soft hit on the last beat's 4th subdivision.
- **S (Snare):** `----|O---|----|O---`  
  - Snare on beat 2 and 4.
- **H (Hi-hat):** `--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`  
  - Hi-hat hits on all beats at various subdivisions.
- **T (Toms):** `----|----|----|----`  
  - No tom hits.
- **C (Crash):** `O---|----|----|----`  
  - Crash on beat 1.
- **R (Ride):** `----|----|----|----`  
  - No ride hits.

**The request**: "I don't want tom on beat 4," but currently, no toms are present. It's already compliant with that requirement.

**Conclusion:**  
Since no tom hits exist on beat 4 currently, the original groove already satisfies the condition. No change is needed.

**The groove already meets the criterion; no modifications are necessary.**
