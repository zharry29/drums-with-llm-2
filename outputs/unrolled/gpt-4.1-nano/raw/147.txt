Let's review the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** Alternates between heavy hits ("OOO-") and other patterns, providing a solid rhythm.
- **Snare (S):** Only in measure 2 and 4, with hits ("O---" and "O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** Silent ("----" in all measures).
- **Toms (T) and Cymbals (C, R):** Silent, except for crashes ("O---" on measures 1, 2, 3, 4) for cymbals.

**Recap of the request:**  
Add **snare** support (which already exists but only on 2 and 4), and add **hi-hat** (currently missing).

---

### Strategy:
- Keep the existing snare in measures 2 and 4.
- Add hi-hat pattern throughout, for example, steady "x---" on each beat for a foundation.
- Possibly add a snare hit in measure 1 or 3 to create more rhythmic interest.

### Implementation:
- Add hi-hat "x-x-" pattern in all measures.
- Possibly add a snare in measure 1, beat 3 ("--S-") or measure 3, beat 2 ("-S--").

### Final groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|--S-|O---
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

```

**Description:**  
- The hi-hat plays a steady "x-x-" pattern throughout, underpinning the rhythm.
- Snare added in measure 3, beat 2 ("-S--"), for more groove variation.
- The existing kick pattern remains unchanged, providing solid support.

This creates a complete rhythmic pattern with both hi-hat and snare, enhancing the overall groove.
