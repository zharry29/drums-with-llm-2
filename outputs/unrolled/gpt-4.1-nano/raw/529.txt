The instruction is to remove all Toms (T) and Hi-Hat (H) lines.

- Remove the T line: `O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`
- Remove the H line: `----|----|----|----` (since it's empty, we can omit it or keep for completeness but it's better to omit)

Remaining instruments:
- K (kick): `O---|O---|----|O---` (keep)
- S (snare): `----|----|O---|----` (keep)
- R (ride): `----|----|----|----` (can remove or leave; since it's silent, we can omit)

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----

This keeps the kick and snare, removing all toms and hi-hat as requested.
