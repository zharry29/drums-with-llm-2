**Thought process:**

- The original groove has no snare (S) or hi-hat (H) hits at the very start.
- To fulfill the request, I will add a snare hit and a hi-hat hit in the first beat.
- The first beat currently has:
  - K: `O---` (kick)
  - S: `----` (no snare)
  - H: `X---` (hi-hat)
- I will change S from `----` to `O---` to add a snare hit.
- The hi-hat (`X---`) is already playing at the start, but to clarify and emphasize, I will keep it as-is or make sure thereâ€™s a hit in the first beat (which it already has).

**Final plan:**

- Change S (snare) first beat to `O---`.
- Keep H as `X---`.

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: O---|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Summary:**  
A snare hit and a hi-hat hit are now both in the first beat, fulfilling the request.
