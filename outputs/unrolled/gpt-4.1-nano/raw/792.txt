**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits on the first beat (`O---`) and second beat starting with a soft hit (`---o`) and second beat (`O-O-`)
  - Snare (S): hits on the second beat, last beat
  - Hi-hat (H): alternating open and closed hits
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash cymbal (C): on first beat
  - Ride cymbal (R): silent

- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and a ride hit in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - Add a tom hit (`O`) at the very first subdivision in T line.
  - Add a ride hit (`O`) at the very first subdivision in R line.

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

**This adds a tom hit and a ride hit at the very beginning as requested.**
