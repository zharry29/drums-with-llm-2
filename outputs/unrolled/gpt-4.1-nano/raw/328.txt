Let's analyze what we're working with before editing:

**Current groove:**
- **Kick (K):** no hits at all.
- **Snare (S):** no hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** hits on beat 2 and 4 ("x---", "x---").
- **Toms (T):** no hits.
- **Cymbals (C):** no hits.
- **Ride (R):** hits on all four beats with alternating open and closed hits ("x---", "X-x-", "x---", "X-x-").

**Request:**
- Remove ride (R) and snare (S).
- Keep everything else, just eliminate those two instruments.

### Approach:
- Erase the R and S lines.
- Keep the kick pattern (which is empty now) as is or modify if desired.
- Keep hi-hat as it provides the rhythm while not being ride or snare.

### Adjustments:
- Given the kick is currently empty, perhaps add some kick hits to sustain a beat.
- Keep hi-hat pattern to preserve the groove's pulsing feel.

### Final edited groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This creates a simple, clean, hi-hat-driven pattern with no snare or ride, matching your specifications. If you want, I can add kick hits for more movement!
