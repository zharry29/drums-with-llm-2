**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `OOO-` to `O---` (adding a single, clear kick on the first note).
- To add a hi-hat hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of H from `----` to `x---` (a soft closed hi-hat).
- Keep other parts the same.

**Implementation:**

- K: from `OOO-` to `O---`
- H: from `----` to `x---`

---

**Final groove:**

K: O---|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

Now, there's a kick and hi-hat in the very first beat, as requested.
