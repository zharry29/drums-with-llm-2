Since the instruction is to remove all ride cymbal (R) and hi-hat (H) parts, I will delete those lines from the original groove. The remaining instruments are kick (K), snare (S), Toms (T), and crash cymbal (C).

**Original groove:**
- K: plays at various points with a mix of hard and soft hits.
- S: plays on beats 2 and 4 with a combination of open and closed hits.
- H: plays on every beat with alternating hard and soft open and closed hits.
- T: silent.
- C: silent.
- R: silent in this groove.

**Adjustment:**
- Remove the H and R lines entirely.
- Keep the K and S lines intact.
- Keep the C line to add some accent (on beat 1 here).

**Result:**
- The groove now emphasizes kick, snare, and crash cymbal.
- For variation, I might add a subtle kick and snare pattern while removing the hi-hat and ride.

**Note:** This pattern features kick and snare with crash, and omits hihat and ride, as per the request.
