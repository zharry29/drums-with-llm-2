**Thought process:**

- The original groove has no snare or hi-hat hits at the very start.
- To fulfill the request, I will add a snare hit and a hi-hat hit in the first beat.
- For the snare, I will change the first beat of S from `----` to `O---`.
- For the hi-hat, I will change the first beat of H from `----` to `x---`.
- The current H line is `----|----|----|----`, so I will modify the first beat to `x---`.

**Implementation:**

- Snare (S): `O---` in the first beat.
- Hi-hat (H): `x---` in the first beat.

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: O---|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: x---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

**Note:** The snare and hi-hat are now both hit at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
