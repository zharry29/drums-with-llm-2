Let's analyze the timing first:

- The second beat covers notes 5-8.
- The subdivision "1 e & a" maps as:
  - 1 : note 5
  - e : note 6
  - & : note 7
  - a : note 8

- The "a" is the last sixteenth note of beat 2, which corresponds to note 8.

Now, find the position of note 8 in the notation:

- Each beat is 4 characters, separated by `|`.
- Beat 2's characters are from position 6 to 9 (since the first beat is positions 1-4).

- Note 8 corresponds to the 4th character of the second beat, which is position 9 overall.

In the `C:` (cymbal) line:

`C: O---|O---|O---|O---`

- The second group is `O---`, covering positions 6-9.

- The last character of that group (position 9) is currently `-`.

To add the cymbal hit on 'a', change this character from `-` to `O`.

### Final groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

```

**Change:**
- The 9th character (last in the second beat) of the `C:` line changed from `-` to `O` to insert the cymbal hit on the 'a'.
