**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): silent
  - Snare (S): silent
  - Hi-hat (H): hits on second and last subdivisions with soft open (`x---`) and soft closed (`x---`)
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): hits on first and third with open and closed variants (`x---`, `X-x-`)

- Request:
  - Add a ride hit and hi-hat in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Place a ride hit (`O`) at the first subdivision of R
  - Place a hi-hat hit (`x`) at the first subdivision of H

**This includes a ride hit and a hi-hat hit at the very beginning as requested.**
