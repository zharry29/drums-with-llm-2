Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits o on beats 1 and 3, with soft hits.
- **Snare (S):** on beats 2 and 3 in two measures, with X (hard sidestick) on beat 2 and beat 3, but silent elsewhere.
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes ("x---") on beats 2 and 4, giving a subtle textured pulse.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** pattern with cross-sticks ("x---", "X-x", etc.).

### Objective:
Add a ride cymbal pattern to support the groove, balancing with the hi-hat for a fuller sound.

### Approach:
- Add ride hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the closed hi-hat for texture.
- Maintain the overall groove rhythmically.

---

### Final plan:
- Insert "O---" in the R line on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the hi-hat ghost notes.
- Keep the existing kick and snare patterns.

---

### Final groove:

**Summary:**  
- Added ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4 in the ride line.
- Maintained the subtle hi-hat ghost notes.
- The groove now combines snare, kick, hi-hat, and ride cymbal, creating a richer rhythmic foundation.
