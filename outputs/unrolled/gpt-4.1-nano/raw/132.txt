Let's analyze the initial groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits at first beat (hard), and on measure 2 beat 3 (soft).
- **Snare (S):** hits on measure 2 beat 1 and measure 4 beat 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** hits with alternating closed and open hits.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on measure 1 beat 1.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### Goal:
Add a **ride cymbal** along with **toms**.

---

### Approach:
- Introduce **ride** hits, probably on beats 2 and 4.
- Add a tom hit for flavor, for example, on measure 3 beat 4.

---

### Final plan:
- Add ride hits ("X") on measure 2 beat 4, and measure 4 beat 2.
- Add tom hit ("--O-") on measure 3 beat 4.

### Implementation:
- Keep the existing groove as a base.
- Insert ride cymbal hits ("X") in the appropriate places.
- Insert tom hit in measure 3 beat 4.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**
- Ride cymbals ("X") introduced into measure 2 beat 4 and measure 4 beat 2 for rhythmic emphasis.
- Tom hit ("--O-") added on measure 4 beat 4.
- The groove maintains its original feel but now includes both **ride** and **toms** for a fuller sound.
