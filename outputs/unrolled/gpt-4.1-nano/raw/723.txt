**Thought process:**

- The original groove has a hi-hat pattern `X-x-` across all beats, which already includes hits on every beat.
- To add a cymbal at the very beginning, I will set the first beat of the cymbal (C) from `----` to `O---` to represent a crash cymbal hit.
- The hi-hat is already active, so no need to change it.
- This will fulfill the request for a hi-hat and cymbal in the very beginning.

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:**  
- The cymbal hit (`O---`) is now explicitly at the start.  
- The hi-hat pattern remains unchanged, given it already features hits on every beat.
