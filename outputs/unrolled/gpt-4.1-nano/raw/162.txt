Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 ("O---") and 3 ("O---").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 ("O---") and 4 ("O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** steady closed hits every beat "X---".
- **Toms, Cymbals, Ride:** silent.

### Goal:
- Add more snare activity or variation.
- Keep the kick pattern.
- Probably strengthen the groove with both kick and snare.

### Approach:
- Keep the existing kick pattern.
- Add a different snare pattern, perhaps with some ghost hits or extra hits on beat 1 or 3 for variation.
- To reinforce the rhythm, let's add snare hits on beats 1 and 3 with some variation, possibly adding ghost notes or subtle hits to complement.

### Final plan:
- Keep kick on beats 1 and 3.
- Add snare on beats 1 and 3 ("-O--" and "-O--"), replacing or adding to current pattern.

### Final edited groove:

**Summary:**  
- The snare now hits on beats 1, 2, and 3 with some ghost notes for a fuller rhythm.
- The kick remains on beats 1 and 3.
- Hi-hat maintains consistent rhythm.

This provides a more complex and interesting pattern with both high and low activity, supporting the groove.
