Let's analyze the given groove:

- Snare (S): has pattern `----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o` — should be removed.
- Toms (T): pattern `----|----|----|----` — should be removed.
- Kick (K): `O--O|----|--O-|----` — to keep.
- Hi-hat (H): `----|----|----|----` — silent, can be omitted.
- Cymbal (C): `----|----|----|----` — silent, can be omitted.
- Ride (R): `o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-` — to keep.

Since only Kick, Hi-hat, Cymbal, and Ride remain, after removing snare and toms, the patterns will be:

K: `O--O|----|--O-|----`  
H: (none, silent)  
C: (none, silent)  
R: `o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-`

**Final pattern:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

This version excludes snare and toms, keeping only kick, ride, and silence on hi-hat.
