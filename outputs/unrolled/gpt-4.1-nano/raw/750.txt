**Thought process:**

- The original groove:
  - Kick (K): `o---|--o-|o---|--o-` (Kick in beats 1, 2, 3, and 4, alternating soft hits)
  - Snare (S): `----|X---|--X-|----` (Snare on beat 2 and 3, with sidestick hits)
- The request is to add a snare hit and a kick in the first beat.
- Currently, the first beat of K is `o---` (soft kick), so we already have a kick there.
- The first beat of S is `----` (no snare), so we need to add a snare here:
  - Change S's first beat from `----` to `O---` to add a hard snare hit.
- The rest of the pattern stays unchanged.

**Final groove:**

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: O---|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**Outcome:**  
The first beat now contains both a kick (`o---`) and a snare (`O---`), fulfilling the request.
