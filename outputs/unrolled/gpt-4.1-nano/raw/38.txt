Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': hits on beats 1 and 2 with soft hits, and again on beat 3.
- Snare 'S': hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat 'H': plays alternating open and closed hits on every beat ('--o-', 'O-o-', etc.).
- Toms 'T': no hits.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': 'C' has a hit on beat 1, and 'R' has no hits.

**Request:** Add some ride cymbal to the groove.

Currently, the ride 'R' has no hits. To add some ride cymbal, I will introduce some ride hits, preferably on beats 2 and 4, to complement the existing pattern, which already features snare hits on those beats for some consistency.

The ride symbols are:

- 'O' for hard open bell hit,
- 'o' for soft bell hit,
- 'X'/'x' for closed hits (hard/soft).

I'll add ride hits on beats 2 and 4, in some pattern that complements the existing groove.

**Explanation:**  
- I added ride hits on beats 1, 2, 3, 4 in the 'R' line with open hits ('O') to enhance the groove.
- This provides a consistent ride presence, especially emphasizing beats 2 and 4 where snare hits are already present.
- The overall pattern remains balanced with hi-hat and kick, plus the added ride cymbal.

This fulfills the request to add some ride cymbal to the pattern.
