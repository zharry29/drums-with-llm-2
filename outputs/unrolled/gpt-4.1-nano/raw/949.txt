Let's analyze the provided groove:

- K (Kick): `O---|---o|O-O|-`
  - Kicks occur on the first beat (O---), second beat (---o), third beat (O-O-), and none on the fourth beat.

- S (Snare): `----|O---|----|O---`  
  - Snare hits on second and fourth beats.

- H (Hi-hat): `--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`  
  - Hi-hat hits distributed throughout, including on beat 4.

- T (Toms): `----|----|----|----`  
  - No toms.

- C (Crash): `O---|----|----|----`  
  - Crash on beat 1.

- R (Ride): `----|----|----|----`  
  - Currently no ride hits.

---

**Goal:** Remove any ride hits on beat 4.

**Observation:** The current R line is all dashes, so there are no ride hits on beat 4â€”it's already satisfying that condition.

---

### Final step:
Since the current groove already satisfies the request, I will generate a version matching the original, emphasizing clarity:

K: O---|---o|O-O|-  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

This version confirms that there's no ride on beat 4, remaining consistent with the request.
