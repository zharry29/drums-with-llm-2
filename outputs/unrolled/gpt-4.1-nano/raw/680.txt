**Thought process:**

- To add a cymbal hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---` (crash cymbal).
- To add a tom in the very beginning, change the first beat of T from `----` to `O---` (tom hit).
- Both should occur simultaneously at the first beat to fulfill the request.

**Implementation:**

- T: from `----` to `O---`
- C: from `----` to `O---`

---

**Final output:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Both a cymbal and a tom now occur at the very beginning.
