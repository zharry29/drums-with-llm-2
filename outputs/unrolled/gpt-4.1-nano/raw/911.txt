Let's analyze the original groove:

- The second beat is **--O-** for kick (K), **O---** for snare (S), and so on.
- The second beat pattern in each instrument has some hits.

**Goal:** Drop out everything in the second beat.

This means removing all hits in that beat segment, which is the second group of 4 characters (notes 5-8).

### Process:
- For the kick, **--O-** becomes ----
- For the snare, **O---** becomes ----
- For the hi-hat, **----** remains ----
- For the Toms, **----** remains ----
- For the cymbals, **O---** becomes ----
- For the ride, **----** remains ----

### Final groove:

K: OOO-|----|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|----|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

Note that the second beat (middle group in each line) is now all empty.
