**Thought process:**

- To add a ride hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of R from `----` to `O---` (a ride cymbal hit on the bell within the first beat).
- To ensure a kick in the very beginning, confirm that the first beat of K already has a kick `O--O`.
- To make it more prominent, I will ensure both the kick and ride are explicitly present in the first beat.

**Implementation:**

- K: remains `O--O` (already present)
- R: change first beat from `----` to `O---`

---

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

*Note:* The ride cymbal now hits in the first beat, and the kick is also present in the first beat, as requested.
