Let's analyze the initial groove:

- **Kick (K):** silent throughout
- **Snare (S):** silent
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes on beat 2 ("x---") and beat 4 ("x---")
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** pattern with mixed open and closed hits

The goal: add a tom pattern along with the kick to make the groove more dynamic and rhythmically interesting.

### Planning:
- Introduce tom hits to create a more energetic fill.
- Keep the kick rhythm simple or enhance it slightly.
- Possibly angle the tom hits on beat 3 or as fills on beat 4 for variety.
- Ensure that the tom pattern is punchy and complements the existing hi-hat and cymbals.

### Approach:
- Add a tom hit on the third beat ("-O--") to give some depth.
- Add a kick pattern, perhaps soft hits ("o---") to support the groove.
- Keep hi-hat ghost notes as they are for texture.
- Keep cymbal pattern as a support layer.

---

### Final plan:
- Add a tom hit on beat 3 ("-O--")
- Add a kick hit shortly before beat 3, perhaps soft ("o---")
- Keep hi-hat ghost notes for texture
- Keep cymbal pattern as in original

### Final groove:

K: ----|o---|--O-|----

T: ----|----|--O-|----
C: ----|----|----|----

```

**Summary:**
- **Kick**: soft hit ("o---") on beat 2 for subtle support
- **Tom**: hit ("--O-") on beat 3 for added depth
- **Hi-hat ghost notes** unchanged
- **Cymbal pattern** remains intact for continuity

This update introduces a tom to give more rhythmic interest, aligns with the existing groove, and maintains balance across the kit.
