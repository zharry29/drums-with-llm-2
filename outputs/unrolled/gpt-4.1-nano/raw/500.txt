The instruction is to remove all ride cymbal (R) and toms (T).  
- The T line is: `----|----|---O|----</O>` → remove it entirely.  
- The R line is: `----|----|----|----` → remove it as well.

Remaining instruments:
- Kick (K): `-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-`
- Snare (S): `----|----|S---|----` → snare only on beat 3, with an S.
- Hi-hat (H): `x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-` eststeady pattern.
- Cymbals (C): `O---|O---|O---|O---` (a crash on each beat; we'll keep it since crash is generally included unless told otherwise).

Since ride and tom are removed, to enhance the pattern, we could keep the snare on beat 3 as a backbeat, the kick pattern, and maintain the hi-hat and crash for rhythmic drive.

**Final version:**

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---

This preserves the rhythm, excludes ride cymbal and toms, and maintains a balanced, straightforward drum pattern.
