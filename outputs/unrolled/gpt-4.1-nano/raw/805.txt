**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): soft hit (`-O--`), two hits in second beat, one in third beat, and two in fourth beat
  - Snare (S): silent
  - Hi-hat (H): alternating closed hits on each subdivision
  - Toms (T): only one hit on the third beat
  - Crash (C): hits on all four beats
  - Ride (R): silent

- Request:
  - Add a ride hit and snare in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Place a ride hit (`O`) at first subdivision in R
  - Place a snare hit (`O`) at first subdivision in S

**Final edited groove:**

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: O---|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|----|----|----

**The groove now includes a ride hit and a snare in the very beginning, as requested.**
