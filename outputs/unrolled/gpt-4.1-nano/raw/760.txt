**Thought process:**

- The original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O--O|----|--O-|----` (kick in the first beat and third)
  - Snare (S): `----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o` (snare on the second and fourth beats with variations)
  - Hi-hat (H): `X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-` (hi-hat on all beats, alternating open/closed)
  - Toms, Crash, Ride: silent

- The request: add a hi-hat hit and a kick in the very first beat.

- The first beat currently has:
  - Kick: `O` in the first note (already present)
  - Hi-hat: `X` in the first note (already present)

- To emphasize both, I will:
  - Keep the kick as `O` in the first note.
  - Keep the hi-hat as `X` in the first note (already appears).

- Since both are already present, I will just rephrase or confirm that the pattern is as compact as possible.

**Final step:** No need to modify the pattern because it already has a kick and hi-hat in the first beat.

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**  
The first beat already contains both a kick (`O`) and a hi-hat (`X`), fulfilling the request.
