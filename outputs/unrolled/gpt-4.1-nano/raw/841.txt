**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `o---`, `--o-`, `o---`, `--o-`
  - Snare (S): `----`, `X---`, `--X-`, `----`
  - Hi-hat (H): `----`, `x---`, `----`, `x---`
  - Toms (T): all rests
  - Crash cymbal (C): all rests
  - Ride cymbal (R): `x---`, `X-x-`, `x---`, `X-x-`

- Request:
  - Add a kick hit and cymbal in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - Change the first beat of K to include a kick (e.g., keep `o---` or make it stronger)
  - Add a cymbal hit in the first beat; since crash cymbal is represented with `O` or `X`, change the first beat of R to `X---` for emphasis

---

**Final edit:**

- Keep the kick as `O---` to emphasize it.
- Change the first beat of R from `x---` to `X---` to add a cymbal crash.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
C: X---|----|----|----
R: X---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**This adds a cymbal crash and a prominent kick in the very beginning as requested.**
