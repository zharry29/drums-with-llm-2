The request is to remove the kick (K) and snare (S) lines entirely.

- K line: `o---|--o-|o---|--o-` → remove
- S line: `----|X---|--X-|----` → remove

Remaining instruments:
- H: `----|x---|----|x---`
- T: `----|----|----|----`
- C: `----|----|----|----`
- R: `x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-`

Since the hi-hat (H) and ride (R) are still present, and you've requested no kick or snare, I interpret the instruction as just removing K and S; the rest remain.

However, if you want to completely silence the groove (no instruments at all), we can leave all silent. But I think you want me to only eliminate kick and snare, keeping the rest.

So, the new groove with only hi-hat, toms, cymbals:

@@@
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-
@@@

This maintains the remaining percussion elements, eliminating the kick and snare.
