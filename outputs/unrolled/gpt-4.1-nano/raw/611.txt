To fulfill the request of adding a tom hit and cymbal in the very beginning, I'll focus on the first beat (the first four characters of each line):

Original first beat:
- K: ----
- S: ----
- H: ----
- T: ----
- C: ----
- R: x---

**Plan:**
- Add a tom hit: T: O--- (a hard tom in the first 16th note)
- Add a cymbal (crash): C: O--- (a crash cymbal in the first 16th note)

Since the cymbal is already silent in the first beat in the original groove, I will change it to O---.

**Implementation:**
- Set T: O---
- Set C: O---

All other parts remain the same.

**Final groove:**

H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This introduces a rare but impactful tom hit and cymbal crash at the very beginning, as requested.
