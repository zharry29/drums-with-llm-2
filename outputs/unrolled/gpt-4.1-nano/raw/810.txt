**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits in the first, second, and last beats
  - Snare (S): hits only on the third beat
  - Hi-hat (H): no hits
  - Toms (T): hits alternate softly across beats
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): silent

- Request:
  - Add a snare hit and a ride hit in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Place a snare hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in S
  - Place a ride hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in R

**Final edited groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: O---|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

**The groove now has a snare and a ride hit at the very beginning, as requested.**
