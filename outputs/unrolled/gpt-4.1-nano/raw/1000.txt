Let's analyze and plan the change:

- The current hi-hat line is: `----|----|----|----`, so no hi-hat is played.
- The instruction: **Play closed hi-hat on all 16th notes**.
- **Accent the down beats** at notes 1, 5, 9, 13 by making them louder with `X`.
- Other hi-hat notes will be `x` for a softer, consistent sound.

Constructing the new hi-hat line:
- Positions 1, 5, 9, 13: `X`
- All other notes: `x`

The pattern:
`Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx`

---

### Final groove after edit:

```plaintext
@@@@@@@@
K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@@@@@@
```

This provides a steady, accented closed hi-hat pattern on all 16th notes, emphasizing the downbeats for a strong rhythmic foundation.
