Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** silent.
- **Snare (S):** silent.
- **Hi-hat (H):** hits on beats 2 and 4 with ghost notes ("x---" in measures 2 and 4).
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** pattern with some ghost and accented hits ("x---", "X-x", etc.).

**Objective:**  
Add a Ride cymbal pattern alongside the existing hi-hat, enriching the cymbal section and giving more rhythmic support.

### Approach:
- Keep the hi-hat pattern as it is.
- Add Ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4, for a consistent ride pattern.
- Use the existing Ride pattern to support this, possibly enhancing with some ghost or accented hits for variation.

### Implementation:
- Insert "O---" in the R line on beats 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Keep the hi-hat ghost notes unchanged.

### Final groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

**Summary:**  
- **Ride cymbal ("O---")** added on all four beats.
- **Hi-hat** remains in place for subtle texture.
- The groove now combines the steady hi-hat with a full ride pattern, creating a fuller rhythmic sound.
