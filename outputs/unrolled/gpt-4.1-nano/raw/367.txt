Let's analyze the original groove:

- The 'K' line has hits early in the bar, with some soft and hard hits.
- The 'S' line has no hits.
- The 'H' line shows consistent hi-hat pattern.
- The 'T' (Toms) line has a tom hit only in beat 3.
- The 'C' and 'R' lines (cymbals and ride) are present with hits in all four beats.

**Request:** Remove all cymbal and ride hits -(C and R lines).

Since the 'C' and 'R' lines are in the original and contain hits, I will eliminate those lines or just ignore any hits in those lines for the new groove.

### Approach:
- Keep 'K', 'S', 'H', 'T' lines.
- Remove all 'C' and 'R' lines or set all their hits to '-' (no hits).

### Final edited groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This version excludes any cymbal or ride hits, fulfilling the request, while keeping the groove rhythmically interesting with kick, snare, hi-hat, and toms.
