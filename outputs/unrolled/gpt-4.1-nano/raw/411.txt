Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on the first and third beats with soft hits.
- Snare (S): plays on the second beat ("Oo-o") and last beat ("O--o").
- Hi-hat (H): plays on every eighth note with a pattern of closed hits.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C, R): silent.

**The request is to remove all hi-hat and cymbal sounds.**

Therefore, we will eliminate lines H, C, and R.

The remaining patterns are:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----  
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o  

Since the snare is present, and the kick is there, keeping the pattern creates a solid beat.

The pattern after removing hi-hat and cymbal lines:

@@@
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: (removed)
T: (removed)
C: (removed)
R: (removed)
@@@

This results in a clear, simplified groove with kick and snare only.
