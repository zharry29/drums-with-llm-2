Let's analyze the current groove and the request:

- The existing groove has:
  - On the cymbal line (C): "----|----|----|----"
  - No hits in any beat, including beat 4.

Since there are no cymbal hits on beat 4 currently, the groove already satisfies the requirement of "no cymbal on beat 4."

**Therefore, no changes are needed.**

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This groove remains the same, as it already meets the condition.
