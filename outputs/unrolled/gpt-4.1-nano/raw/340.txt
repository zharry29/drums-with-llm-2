Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': O--- | O--- | ---- | O---  
  - Kicks on beats 1, 2, and 4, with some variation.
- Snare 'S': ---- | ---- | O--- | ----  
  - Snare only hits on beat 3.
- Hi-hat 'H': ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  
  - No hi-hat hits.
- Toms 'T': O-o- | O-o- | O-o- | O-o-  
  - Toms are playing on every beat, with alternating open and closed hits.
- Cymbals 'C' and Ride 'R': none.

**Request:** No hi-hat or toms.

### Approach:
- Remove the 'H' and 'T' lines entirely.
- Keep 'K' (kick), 'S' (snare), and 'R' (ride cymbal) if applicable.
- Since the current pattern has no ride calls (R), and only the kick and snare, we'd preserve those.

### Final decision:
- Keep the kick pattern.
- Keep the snare on beat 3.
- Add a subtle ride cymbal pattern on beats 2 and 4 if desired.

Since only the 'K', 'S', and 'R' lines are relevant and the edit only disallows hi-hat and toms, I will remove the 'H' and 'T' lines and leave the others as is.

### Final groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This version maintains the kick and snare pattern with a simple ride cymbal pattern (no hits, but if desired, I could add some). For simplicity, I will keep ride with no hits, as that aligns with the original pattern. Alternatively, I could add ride hits on beats 2 and 4 for more rhythm.

**Final answer:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This meets the request of removing hi-hat and toms while keeping a coherent rhythmic pattern.
