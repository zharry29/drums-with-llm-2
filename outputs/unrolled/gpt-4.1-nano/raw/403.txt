Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): plays various hits with some soft hits ('o' or 'O') on different beats.
- Snare (S): plays on the third beat, with some snare hits ('S') but you mentioned the need to remove snare.
- Hi-hat (H): consistent pattern of closed hits ('x' or 'X'), which can stay.
- Toms (T): plays on the third beat ('O'), which should be removed.
- Crash (C): plays on the first, second, and third beats, which can stay.
- Ride (R): silent.

**Edits needed:**

- Remove snare (S) and toms (T) entirely.
- Keep the kick (K), hi-hat (H), and crash (C).

Now, for a clean, rhythmic groove:

- Keep the kick pattern as is for rhythmic pulse.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern to maintain energy.
- Keep the crash cymbal pattern to accent the downbeats.
- Remove the snare and toms.

**Modified pattern:**

- K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-  
- H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x- (a steady closed hi-hat pattern)  
- C: O---|O---|O---|O--- (crash on the first beat of each measure)  
- R: (silent, as it was originally)

Here's the final groove, cleaned up as specified:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This creates a simple, effective groove without snare or toms, maintaining rhythmic drive and energy.
