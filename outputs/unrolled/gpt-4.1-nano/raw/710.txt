**Thought process:**

- To meet the request, I need to add a cymbal hit and a hi-hat hit at the very beginning.
- The cymbal (C) is currently `-----` in the first beat, so I will change it to `O----` to add a crash cymbal on the first beat.
- The hi-hat (H) is currently `----` in the first beat, so I will change it to `x---` to add a hi-hat hit.
- The other instruments remain unchanged.

---

**Final plan:**

- K: remains `----`
- S: remains `----`
- H: becomes `x---`
- T: remains `----`
- C: becomes `O---`
- R: remains `x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-` (no change)

**Final groove:**

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: x---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This includes a cymbal hit and a hi-hat in the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
