**Thought process:**

- To add a ride hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of R from `----` to `O---` (a ride hit).
- To add a kick in the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `O---` to `O---` (already a kick). To make it explicit, keep the kick as is.
- Since the first beat of K is already `O---`, just change the first beat of R to `O---`.

---

**Implementation:**

- K: remains `O---` (it's already a kick)
- R: change first beat from `----` to `O---`

Other instruments stay the same.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

This now includes both a kick and a ride hit at the very beginning.
