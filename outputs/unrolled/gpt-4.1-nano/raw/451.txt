Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits at start and on beat 2 (soft on beat 2, O and o).
- Snare (S): hits on beat 2 and 4, with high and soft hits.
- Hi-hat (H): plays on every beat with mixed open and closed hits.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C): plays on beat 1.
- Ride (R): silent.

**Request:** no cymbal or hi-hat.

So, I will:

- Remove the H and C lines.
- Keep K, S, T, R (as none involve cymbal or hi-hat).
- Toms (T) and Ride (R) are silent, so they can be omitted or remain empty.

### Final plan:

- Keep the kick pattern.
- Keep snare on beats 2 and 4.
- Leave the Toms and Ride lines empty for simplicity.

### Final groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----
C: (removed)
R: ----|----|----|----

This results in a straightforward rhythm with kick drums and snare, no cymbal or hi-hat, as requested.
