Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3 ("O---" in measures 1 and 3).
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 ("O---" at measures 2 and 4).
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent closed hi-hat ("X---") on all beats, giving pulse.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### Objective:
Add a ride cymbal pattern to complement the existing rhythm, especially supporting the snare pattern, while ensuring the groove becomes fuller and more dynamic.

### Approach:
- Introduce ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4, as common in jazz and many styles.
- Keep existing kick and snare patterns.
- The hi-hat can stay as subtle pulse with ghost notes.

### Implementation:
- Add ride cymbal "O---" on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the kick pattern as is.
- Maintain hi-hat ghost notes for subtlety.

### Final groove:

**Explanation:**
- Ride cymbal now added on beats 2 and 4 ("O---") in the ride line.
- Kick remains on beats 1 and 3.
- Snare on beats 2 and 4, supported by ride cymbal.
- Hi-hat ghost notes are preserved for rhythmic texture.
- This creates a balanced, fuller rhythmic pattern with both snare and ride accents.
