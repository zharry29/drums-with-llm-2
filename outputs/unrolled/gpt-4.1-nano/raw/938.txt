Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick line (K): `O--O|----|--O-|----`

Breakdown by beats:
- Beat 1: `O--O` (kick hits at start and end of beat 1)
- Beat 2: `----` (no kick)
- Beat 3: `--O-` (kick hit at third 16th note of beat 3)
- Beat 4: `----` (no kick)

The request is **no kick on beat 4**. Currently, beat 4 has no kick, so it already satisfies this condition.

**No changes are needed.**

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The groove remains the same, as it already honors the request.
