**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit in the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `O---` to `O---` (already a kick present, no change needed).
- To add a hi-hat hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of H from `----` to `x---` (a soft closed hi-hat on the first note).
- Keep other parts unchanged.

**Implementation:**

- K stays `O---`
- H: from `----` to `x---`

---

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: x---|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

Now, the groove has a kick and hi-hat together in the very first beat.
