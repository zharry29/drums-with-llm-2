Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on all beats with both hard and soft hits.
- Snare (S): only on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat (H): no hits.
- Toms (T): no hits.
- Cymbals (C): hits on beats 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Ride (R): no hits.

**Request:** no cymbal or hi-hat.

**Approach:**

- Remove C and H lines.
- Keep K and S, since they are core rhythm instruments.
- T and R are silent, so leave them empty.

### Final plan:
- Keep the kick as is.
- Keep snare on beats 2 and 4.
- Remove the cymbals and hi-hat.

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This maintains a basic rhythmic foundation with kick and snare, with no cymbals or hi-hat, matching your request.
