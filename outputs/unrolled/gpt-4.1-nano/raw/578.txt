The request is to remove any ride cymbal (R) and crash cymbal (C). The current groove includes:

- C: O---|O---|O---|O---
- R: ----|----|----|----

To fulfill the request, I will delete lines for C and R entirely, leaving only kick, snare, hi-hat, and toms.

Remaining instruments after removal:
- K: `-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-`
- S: `----|----|S---|----`
- H: `x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-`
- T: `----|----|---O|----`
- R: (deleted)
- C: (deleted)

Now, to keep the beat interesting without cymbals:
- The hi-hat line (`H`) already has a steady pattern.
- I might add some subtle tom hits for flavor but keeping it simple could be more effective.

Here's my final pattern emphasizing the existing instruments:

@@@
K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|--O-|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This version avoids cymbals altogether, retains rhythmic interest with the hi-hat, and keeps the core percussion elements.
