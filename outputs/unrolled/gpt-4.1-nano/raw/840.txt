**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O---`, `O---`, `----`, `O---`
  - Snare (S): `----`, `----`, `O---`, `----`
  - Hi-hat (H): `----`, `----`, `----`, `----`
  - Toms (T): `O-o-`, `O-o-`, `O-o-`, `O-o-`
  - Crash (C): all rests
  - Ride (R): all rests

- Request:
  - Add a kick hit and cymbal in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Keep the first beat of kick as is (`O---`)
  - Add a crash cymbal hit in the first beat (represented as `O` or `X` in the crash line). Since the crash line is all rests, replace the first beat with a crash cymbal.

- To do this, I will:
  - Change the first beat of the K line to `O---` (already had that)
  - Change the first beat of the C line to `X---` to include a cymbal hit

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: X---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**This adds a cymbal crash and maintains the kick in the very beginning, fulfilling the request.**
