**Thought process:**

- In the original groove:
  - Kick (K): `OOO- | --O- | OOO- | -OOO`
  - Cymbal (C): `O--- | O--- | O--- | O---`
- The request is to add a kick hit and cymbal in the very beginning.
- To do this:
  - Keep the first beat of the kick as is (it's already strong with `OOO-`).
  - Change the first beat of the cymbal (C) from `O---` to `X---` to indicate a crash cymbal for emphasis.

**Final adjustment:**

K: OOO- | --O- | OOO- | -OOO
S: ---- | O--- | ---- | O---
H: ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
T: ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
C: X--- | O--- | O--- | O---
R: ---- | ---- | ---- | ----

**This adds a cymbal crash along with the existing kick hits right at the start, matching the request.**
