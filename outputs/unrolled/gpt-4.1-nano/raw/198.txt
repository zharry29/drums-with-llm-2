Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 ("-O--"), beat 2 ("OO--"), beat 3 ("---O"), beat 4 ("-OO-")
- **Snare (S):** only on beat 3 ("S---")
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent ghost notes on every 16th note ("x-x-"), providing continuous texture
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on beats 1, 2, 3 ("O---")
- **Ride (R):** silent

**Objective:**  
Ensure the hi-hat pattern is maintained (which it already is) and perhaps make the groove more consistent with the snare reinforcing beats 3 and 4, or adding emphasis.

### Plan:
- Keep the hi-hat pattern as is (x-x-), as it provides consistent texture.
- Add a snare hit on beat 4 ("---S") to strengthen the backbeat.
- Possibly reinforce or add to the snare on beat 3.

### Implementation:
- Keep snare on beat 3, add snare on beat 4.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern in all four beats.
- Slightly reinforce the kick pattern if needed.

**Summary:**  
- Added a snare hit on beat 4 ("--S-") to give a strong backbeat.
- Kept the hi-hat pattern active throughout.
- Reinforced the overall rhythm with snare placement.
- Maintains the groove's energy and texture, with a clear backbone of snare and hi-hat.
