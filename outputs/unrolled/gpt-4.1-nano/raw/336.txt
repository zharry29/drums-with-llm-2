Let's review the original groove:

- Kick 'K': o---|--o-|o---|--o- — kicks on the first and third beats, with soft hits.
- Snare 'S': ----|X---|--X-|---- — hits on beats 2 and 3 with sidestick.
- Hi-hat 'H': ----|x---|----|x--- — open hi-hat on beats 2 and 4.
- Toms 'T': ----|----|----|---- — none.
- Cymbals 'R': x---|X-x-|x---|X-x- — cymbal hits on all beats.
  
**Request:** No hi-hat or Toms. That means we remove all 'H' and 'T' lines, and their notes.

### Thought process:
- Keep the 'K', 'S', 'R' lines.
- Possibly reorder or adjust the remaining pattern for a cleaner, drum-only sound.
- The cymbal pattern 'R' is already active; keep it for rhythmic accent.
- The kick and snare pattern is straightforward and should stay similar, emphasizing the backbeat.

---

### Final plan:
- Remove the hi-hat 'H' and tom 'T' lines.
- Keep the kick 'K', snare 'S', and cymbal 'R' lines as they are.
- The pattern remains rhythmically interesting with cymbals and the existing kick/snare.

### Final output:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**Note:**  
- The groove now focuses on kick, snare, and cymbal hits, eliminating hi-hat and Toms as per request.
- Maintains rhythmic interest with cymbals and the existing kick/snare pattern.
