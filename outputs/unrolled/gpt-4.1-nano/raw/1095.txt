Let's analyze the original groove:

- The hi-hat (`X---|X---|X---|X---`) is played on every 16th note, providing a steady rhythm.
- The kick hits on beats 1 and 3 (`O---|----|O---|----`).
- The snare hits on beat 2 and beat 4 (`----|O---|----|O---`).
- Toms, crash, and ride are silent.

---

### Objective:
Replace the hi-hat with toms to give a different texture. Toms can be used for fills or emphasizing beats.

### Approach:
- Mute the hi-hat pattern.
- Introduce tom hits, typically on the toms (often low or mid-toms) for fills or accents.
- To keep the pattern lively, spread tom hits across the barâ€”either on specific beats or as fills.

### Implementation:
- I will replace the hi-hat with tom hits on the downbeats and/or upbeats, creating a rounded tom fill and maintaining rhythmic interest.

### Final groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
T: X---|--X-|X---|---X

R: ----|----|----|----

```

### Explanation:
- Kick remains on beats 1 and 3.
- Snare on beats 2 and 4.
- Toms now alternate, with hits on the downbeat and off-beats, adding more tom flavor and a dynamic fill-like feel.
- Cymbals are silent for simplicity.

This creates a solid, rhythmically interesting pattern with toms replacing the steady hi-hat.
