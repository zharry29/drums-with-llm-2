To fill the entire bar with double kick, I will replace the K line so that every 16th note contains a kick, using `O` to indicate a hard hit on each note.

Original K line:
`O---|----|O---|----`

Modified to be a continuous pattern:
`OOOO|OOOO|OOOO|OOOO`

This will create a steady, energetic double kick pattern throughout the bar.

Other instruments stay unchanged unless further modifications are requested.

### Final groove:

K: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

This pattern features a kick on every 16th note, fulfilling the request to fill the entire bar with double kicks.
