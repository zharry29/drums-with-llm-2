Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': plays in various patterns.
- Snare 'S': only in the third measure.
- Hi-hat 'H': consistent pattern.
- Toms 'T': plays on the third beat.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': plays with open and soft hits in every measure.

**Request:** Remove all toms ('T') and ride cymbal ('R') hits.

Since 'T' and 'R' are present, I will remove their hits, which are indicated by characters in the lines.

**Approach:**
- Set all 'T' and 'R' line characters to '-' (no hits).

### Final edited groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This version removes tom and ride cymbal hits, fulfilling the request, while keeping the rhythm and structure intact.
