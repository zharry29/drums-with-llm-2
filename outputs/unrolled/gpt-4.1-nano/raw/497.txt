The instructions are to remove all ride cymbal (R) and toms (T).  
- The T line is: `----|----|----|----` → remove it entirely.  
- The R line is: `----|----|----|----` → remove it as well.

Remaining instruments:
- K (kick): `O--O|----|--O-|----`
- S (snare): `----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o`
- H (hihat): `X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-`

Since there are no ride or toms left, we can keep the hihat pattern as it provides essential rhythm. The kick and snare parts add a good groove.

To normalize:
- Keep the kick as is, with hits on beats 1, 4, and 3.
- Keep the snare on beats 2 and 4, with some variation.
- The hihat providing steady eighth note pattern.

Here's the edited, clean groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: (removed)
T: (removed)

This version is straightforward, complete, and excludes ride cymbals and toms, fitting the request.
