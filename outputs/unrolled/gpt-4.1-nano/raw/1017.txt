Let's look at the current groove:

- The Toms are silent (`----|----|----|----`), so to make it more dynamic, I will add patterning to the Toms to increase energy.
- The rest of the groove is relatively sparse, focusing on ride cymbal hits (`x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-`) and some ghost hits on hi-hat.

### Approach:
1. Keep Toms in the same placement across all 4 beats.
2. Make the Tom pattern more active with hits and accents.
3. Use soft and hard hits (`x`, `X`, `o`, `O`) to add variation and dynamics.
4. Create a pattern that alternates strength so it feels more lively.

### Proposed Toms pattern:
- Make Toms hit on each beat with variations:
  - Beat 1: accent with `X---`
  - Beat 2: softer hit `--o-`
  - Beat 3: accent with `O---`
  - Beat 4: softer hit `--o-`

### Final chosen pattern:
`X---|--o-|O---|--o-`

### Final groove:

**Summary:**  
This makes the Toms more active and expressive, adding dynamics and variation while maintaining placement, creating a more lively and engaging groove.
