Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beat 1 (hard) and beat 2 (soft at note 5) and beat 3 (alternating O and o, giving rhythmic movement).
- Snare (S): hits on beat 2 (last note) and beat 4 (last note).
- Hi-hat (H): busy with varied open and close hits in syncopation.
- Toms (T): no hits yet.
- Cymbals (C): hits on beat 1.
- Ride (R): silent.

**Goal:** Add some toms to spice up the groove and create fills or accents.

**Ideas for placement:**
- Add a soft tom (o) on beat 2, perhaps at note 11, to add a fill before the snare hits.
- Add a hard tom (O) at the very end, on note 16, to create a punchy fill at the finish.

This way, the groove remains rhythmically interesting and the added toms provide dramatic punctuation.

**Final plan:**
- Beat 2, note 11: o (soft tom)
- Beat 4, note 16: O (hard tom)

Here's the revised groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|--O-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds a soft tom just before the last snare, and a hard tom at the end of the measure for a satisfying fill.
