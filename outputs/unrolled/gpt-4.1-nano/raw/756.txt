**Thought process:**

- The original groove:

  - Kick (K): `O---|---o|O-O-|----` — kick in first and second beats (soft in second), last beat in third.
  - Snare (S): `----|O---|----|O---` — snare on second and last beats.
  - Hi-hat (H): `--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-` — hi-hat hits in every beat, with alternating open/closed.
  - Other instruments are unchanged.

- The request:

  - To add a hi-hat hit and a kick in the *very first* beat.

- The first beat for K is `O---`, so the kick is already there, but it is a hard kick.

- For H, the first beat is `--o-`, which is a soft closed hi-hat in the third position.

- To ensure a hi-hat hit in the first beat, change the first beat of H from `--o-` to `x-o-` or `x---`, with the `x` indicating a soft closed hi-hat in the first note.

- To comply, change the first beat of H from `--o-` to `x---` (adding a hi-hat hit at the very first note).

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**

- The very first note (`x` in H) now has a hi-hat hit.
- The first beat contains the existing hard kick.
- Other parts remain unchanged.

**Note:** The change to the hi-hat adds a hit at the very start, fulfilling the request of a hi-hat and kick at the beginning.
