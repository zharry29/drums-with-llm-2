**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits at the first and third beats, with some soft hits
  - Snare (S): hits on second beat and last beat
  - Hi-hat (H): alternating pattern with some open and closed hits
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): hits on first beat only
  - Ride (R): silent

- Requested:
  - Add a ride hit and a snare in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Add a ride hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in R
  - Add a snare hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in S
