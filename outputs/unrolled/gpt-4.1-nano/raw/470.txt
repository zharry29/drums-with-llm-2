Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3 with some variations.
- **Snare (S):** plays on beats 2 and 4 with various open and sidestick hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** playing on every quarter note with evenly spaced open and closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Request:** no snare or kick.

So, we need to remove the S and K lines completely.

Remaining instruments: **H, T, C, R**.

In the original, T, C, R are all silent, so I can choose to add a simple pattern to the hi-hat or leave everything silent if preferred.

**For a balanced pattern**, I'll keep the hi-hat playing steady on every beat/chick, and optionally add some cymbals for texture.

### Final pattern:

@@@
K: (removed)
S: (removed)
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

### This provides:

- Steady hi-hat on all four beats â€” simple, unintrusive.
- Cymbal crash at the start of beat 1 for some emphasis.

### Final answer:

```

K: (removed)
S: (removed)
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
