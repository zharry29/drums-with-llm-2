**Thought process:**

- To add a snare hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of S from `----` to `S---`.
- To add a cymbal at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---` (already a cymbal hit, so no change needed).

Since the cymbal is already present at the start, the only change needed is to add the snare at the beginning.

---

**Implementation:**

- S: `S---` (adding snare hit)
- C: remains `O---`

**Final groove:**

K: ----|----|----|----
S: S---|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This adds a snare hit and keeps the cymbal already in place at the very beginning, fulfilling your request.
