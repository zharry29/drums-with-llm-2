**Thought process:**
- To add a snare hit at the beginning, change the first beat of S from `----` to a snare hit, such as `S---`.
- To add a cymbal at the beginning, change the first beat of C from `----` to a cymbal hit, such as `O---`. Since it is already `----`, this is straightforward.

**Implementation:**
- S: `S---`
- C: `O---` (unchanged)

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: S---|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

This adds a snare hit and maintains the cymbal at the very beginning, as requested.
