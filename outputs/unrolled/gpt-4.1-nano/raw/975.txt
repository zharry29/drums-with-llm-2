Let's analyze the original groove:

- **K (Kick):** `-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-`  
  Contains multiple hits, especially on beats 2 and 4.
- **S (Snare):** `----|----|S---|----`  
  Only on beat 3.
- **H (Hi-hat):** `x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-`  
  Very active, playing on every beat subdivision.
- **T (Toms):** `----|----|---O|----`  
  Only on beat 3.
- **C (Crash):** `O---|O---|O---|O---`  
  Crash on all beats.
- **R (Ride):** `----|----|----|----`  
  No hits.

**Objective:** Less notes overall, meaning reduce the density of hits, especially on the hi-hat and possibly making the pattern sparser.

**Plan:**
- Remove some hi-hat hits, maybe only keep the hi-hat on beats 1 and 3, reducing activity.
- Simplify kick pattern, perhaps only one or two hits.
- Keep the snare on beat 3 for groove depth.
- Keep crash but possibly in fewer places.
- Remove tom hits altogether for simplicity or keep only minimal hits.

### Making these adjustments:

- **Kick:** Use only on beat 1 and 3, removing hits on beat 2 and 4.
- **Snare:** Keep only on beat 3.
- **Hi-hat:** Keep only on beat 1 and 3, removing subdivisions on 2 and 4.
- **Tom:** Remove completely for even less notes.
- **Crash:** Keep only on beat 1.
- **Ride:** No need to include to reduce notes further.

### Final agreed pattern:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|----|---S|----
H: o---|----|o---|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@
```

**Where:**
- Kick on beat 1 and 3.
- Snare only on beat 3.
- Hi-hat only on beats 1 and 3, with a softer hit (`o`) to lighten the pattern.
- No toms.
- Crash only on beat 1.
- Ride is removed for simplicity.

This results in a much sparser, "less notes" groove.
