Let's analyze the current groove:

- The kick (`K`) pattern is quite active, with hits on almost all beats, emphasizing low frequencies.
- The snare (`S`) plays on beats 2 and 4, adding rhythmic backbeat.
- Toms are silent.
- Cymbals and ride are silent.

### Goal:
Increase the low-frequency sounds further, primarily by emphasizing the kick and possibly adding more toms to deepen the low end. Additionally, we could reduce or delay the snare to shift focus toward lower sounds.

### Strategy:
- Strengthen the kick pattern by adding more hits on the different subdivisions.
- Introduce tom hits for depth, especially on the off-beats.
- Keep the snare as is, or move it slightly to complement the low-frequency focus.

K: OOO-|OOO-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|----|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ---o|---o|---o|---o
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

### Explanation:
- The kick (`K`) hits on every subdivision for a fuller low-end foundation.
- The toms now play on all beats with soft hits (`o`), adding depth and low frequencies.
- The snare is kept on beat 4 to maintain rhythmic punctuation but not distract from the enhanced low sounds.
- Other instruments remain silent to prioritize bass frequencies.

This creates a heavy, bass-driven groove emphasizing low frequencies overall.
