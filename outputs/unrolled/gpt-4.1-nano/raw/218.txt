Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on the first and third beats ("O--O" | "----" | "--O-" | "----"). This provides rhythmic foundation.
- **Snare (S):** pattern of "----" | "Oo-o" | "-o--" | "O--o" â€” snare activity on beats 2 and 4, with some ghost notes and softer notes.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** pattern of "o-O-" repeated, adding cymbal texture with open and closed hits.

### Objective:
Add a cymbal (such as crash or ride) along with the snare, to make the rhythm fuller and more energetic.

### Approach:
- Keep the snare pattern as is, as it provides interesting variation.
- To incorporate cymbals, I will:
  - Add a crash cymbal ("O---") on beat 1 for emphasis.
  - Add a ride cymbal ("x---") on beat 3 for texture.
- Keep the existing kick and snare patterns for rhythm.

---

### Final plan:
- Crash cymbal ("O---") on beat 1.
- Ride cymbal ("x---") on beat 3.
- The hi-hat remains silent in the original, so I will leave it as-is.
- Keep the original kick and snare pattern.

---

### Final result:

**This version adds cymbal textures (crash and ride) while preserving the original groove's complexity and feel.**
