Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** strong hits on the first two beats, including a mix of hard and soft hits.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 (soft open) in pattern 2 and beat 4 (hard) in pattern 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (O):** crash hits on the first and third patterns.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

---

### Goal:
Add **tom** and **ride** cymbal to enrich the pattern.

### Approach:
- Include **tom** hits on beat 3, for example, to add interest and percussive depth.
- Include **ride** cymbal hits on beats 2 and 4 to add rhythmic texture.
- Keep the existing pattern intact for cohesion.

---

### Implementation:
- Tom hit on beat 3 ("-O--" or similar).
- Ride cymbal hits on beat 2 and beat 4 ("O---" on both beats).

---

### Final groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|O---|----|O---
T: ----|----|-O--|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|O---|----|O---

```

**Explanation:**

- **Ride (R):** hits on beats 2 and 4 for added rhythmic texture.
- **Tom (T):** hit on beat 3 ("-O--") to add another percussive element.
- Kept the other elements for consistency and groove integrity.

This creates a richer, more layered drum pattern with both ride and tom in the groove.
