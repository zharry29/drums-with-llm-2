**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits on first and third beats (`O---`) and (`O---`)
  - Snare (S): hits on second and last beats
  - Hi-hat (H): consistent closed hits
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): silent

- Requested:
  - Add a ride hit and a snare hit in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - Add a ride hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in R.
  - Keep or add the snare (`O`) at the first subdivision in S.

**This includes a ride hit and a snare hit at the beginning, as requested.**
