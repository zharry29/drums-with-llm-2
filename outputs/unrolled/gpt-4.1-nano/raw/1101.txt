Let's analyze the existing groove:

- The kick drum (`K`) has some hits, mainly on beats 2 and 4, with a mix of soft and hard hits.
- The snare (`S`) is silent.
- The hi-hat (`H`) plays steady eighth-note pattern with soft hits.
- The toms (`T`) are silent.
- The cymbals (`C`) hit on every beat, emphasizing higher frequencies.
- Ride cymbal (`R`) is silent.

### Objective:
Increase the focus on **low frequency sounds**â€”primarily the kick and potentially adding toms. Also, minimize high-frequency percussion like cymbals.

### Approach:
- Strengthen the kick hits, possibly adding more hits or emphasizing the existing ones.
- Introduce tom hits for depth and low end, especially on the beats.
- Remove or reduce cymbal hits that emphasize higher frequencies.

```

### Explanation:
- Kick (`K`) pattern is intensified, emphasizing bass frequencies.
- Toms (`T`) now play on beats 1, 2, and 3, adding low-end depth.
- All cymbal and ride hits are removed to focus on low frequencies.
- Snare remains silent to free up space for bass elements.

This creates a groove that is bass-heavy and resonant in the low frequencies.
