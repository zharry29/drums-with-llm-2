Let's analyze the current groove:
- **Kick (K):** hits on the first and third measures, with some softer hits ("--O-") in measure 2.
- **Snare (S):** hits only in measure 2 and 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on all four beats in each measure, already present.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Note:** The "C" (cymbals) are already present and hitting on each beat, contributing to the cymbal sound. The "R" (ride) is silent. The request is to add *also* a ride to work alongside the cymbals.

### Goal:
- Keep the cymbal hits.
- Add a ride cymbal pattern to complement the existing cymbals.
- Maintain the existing kick, snare, and other elements for consistency.
- Introduce ride hits on specific beats, typically on beats 2 and 4, for a common groove.

---

### Approach:
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O" or "o") in measures 2 and 4 on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the cymbals for fullness.
- Optionally, add a softer ride hit ("o") on off-beats for more subtlety.

---

### Final plan:
- Insert ride hits on measures 2 and 4, beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the "C" hits unchanged.
- Keep everything else the same.

### Final groove:

C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|--O-|----|--O-

```

**Explanation:**
- **Ride hits:** added on measure 2 beat 2 ("--O-") and measure 4 beat 2 ("--O-"), aligning with common practice.
- The cymbals remain, filling the rest of the measures.
- The rhythm now has both cymbals and ride, creating a fuller, more dynamic cymbal pattern.

This configuration satisfies the request for additional cymbal (ride) presence alongside existing cymbals.
