**Thought process:**

- To add a kick in the very first beat, change the first beat of K from `O---` to `O---` (already a kick).
- To add a snare in the very first beat, change the first beat of S from `----` to `--O-` (a snare hit on the third note of the first beat).
- Keep other parts unchanged.

**Implementation details:**

- K: remains as `O---` for the first beat.
- S: from `----` to `--O-` for a snare hit.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: --O-|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Result:** The first beat now has both a kick and a snare, fulfilling the request.
