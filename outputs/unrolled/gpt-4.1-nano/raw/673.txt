**Thought process:**

- To add a ride hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of R from `----` to `O---` (ride cymbal on the bell).
- For the kick, change the first beat of K from `OOO-` to `O-O-` to suggest a more prominent kick pattern in the first beat.
- Keep other parts unchanged.

**Implementation:**

- K: from `OOO-` to `O-O-`
- R: from `----` to `O---`

**Final groove:**

K: O-O-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|----|----|----

This version has both a kick and ride hit at the very start, fulfilling the request.
