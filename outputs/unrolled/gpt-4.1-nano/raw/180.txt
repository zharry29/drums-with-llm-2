Let's analyze the initial groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** closed hits on all beats, providing constant rhythm.
- **Toms (T), Cymbals (C):** no hits.
- **Ride (R):** no hits.

---

### Goals:
- Add a **tom** hit, likely on beat 3 or 4, for rhythmic variation.
- Add a **ride** cymbal for texture, possibly on beat 2 or 4, or replaced for more emphasis.

### Approach:
- Place a tom hit on the last beat (beat 4) to accentuate.
- Keep the ride cymbal on beats to preserve the ride's presence, potentially changing its placement or adding more.

---

### Final decision:
- Keep ride cymbal hits on beat 2 ("O---") and beat 4 ("O---").
- Add a tom hit on beat 4 ("-O--") for more rhythm.
- Ensure the groove remains balanced with the existing pattern.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**

- Ride cymbal kept on beats 2 and 4.
- The groove now has a fuller rhythmic texture with more cymbals and toms.
