Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): hits on the first beat with a mix of strong and soft strikes.
- Snare (S): no activity.
- Hi-hat (H): consistent closed hits.
- Toms (T): no hits yet.
- Cymbals (C): hits on every beat, providing sustained cymbal hits.
- Ride (R): no activity.

**Objective:** Add some tom hits to create fills and variation. The most natural place to add tom hits is during the last available note on beat 3 or 4, where a fill makes sense.

**Ideas for placement:**
- Add a soft tom (o) towards the end of beat 3 to create a fill leading into beat 4.
- Add a hard tom (O) at the end of beat 4 to accentuate the finish and create a fill.

**Specific choices:**
- Beat 3, note 14: insert o.
- Beat 4, note 16: insert O.

Here's the revised groove implementing these ideas:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|--o-|--O-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This version introduces a tom fill in the last moments of the measure, adding rhythmical interest and a dynamic lift at the end.
