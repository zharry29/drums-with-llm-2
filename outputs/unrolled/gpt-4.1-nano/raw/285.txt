Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): silent.
- Snare (S): silent.
- Hi-hat (H): accented ghost notes ("x---" on beats 2 and 4).
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C): silent.
- Ride (R): pattern with cross sticks ("x---", "X-x", etc), which are likely accenting the ride pattern.

**Objective:**  
Add a dedicated ride cymbal pattern to complement the existing cymbal pattern, making the groove richer and more supportive of the rhythm.

### Approach:
- Add ride hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the existing cross stick patterns on the ride to add texture.
- Maintain the ghost notes and existing cymbal pattern for balance.

### Implementation:
- Place "O---" on beats 2 and 4 in the ride line.
- Keep the existing pattern on the ride for texture.

### Final groove:

```plaintext

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: --O-|--O-|x---|X-x-

```

**Explanation:**  
- Added "O---" in the ride line on beats 2 and 4 to bring more rhythmical support.
- Maintained ghosted hi-hat and cymbal elements for texture.
- The groove now has a clear ride pattern complementing the rest, making the overall rhythm fuller and more engaging.
