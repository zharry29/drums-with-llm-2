Let's analyze the original groove:

- The second beat pattern is **----|----** (notes 5-8).
- The snare line (S) has **----|----**, with no hits in beat 2.

**Goal:** Place snare hits on **every 16th note in the second beat**â€”that is, on notes 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Since each beat has 4 notes, this means the snare line in beat 2 should be **OOOO** (hits on all four notes).

### The updated groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|OOOO|----|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

Now, the snare hits every 16th note in the second beat, fulfilling the request while preserving the rest of the groove.
