Let's analyze the existing groove:

- Kick 'K': O--O|----|--O-|----
  - Kick plays on beats 1 and 3.
- Snare 'S': ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
  - Snare hits are on different notes, including open and sidestick variations.
- Hi-hat 'H': ----|----|----|----
  - No hi-hat hits, so can leave.
- Toms 'T': ----|----|----|----
  - No toms, can exclude.
- Cymbal 'C': ----|----|----|----
  - No cymbals, can exclude.
- Ride 'R': o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
  - Cymbal pattern, but per instruction, we want to remove ride.

**Current goal:**
- Remove all snare 'S' and ride 'R' parts.
- Keep the kick pattern.
- To maintain rhythmic interest, letâ€™s add some consistent bass drum hits and consider a steady pattern.

### Plan:
- Keep the kick pattern, perhaps making it more consistent.
- Remove snare and ride.
- Maybe add some hi-hat for rhythm, or leave it sparingly.

### Final decision:
- Keep the kick hits on beats 1 and 3 as current.
- Remove snare and ride.
- Add hi-hat on beats 2 and 4 for keeping pace, lightly.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This pattern maintains the kick, adds hi-hat hits on beats 2 and 4 for a mild dance feel, and removes all snare and ride, aligning with the request.
