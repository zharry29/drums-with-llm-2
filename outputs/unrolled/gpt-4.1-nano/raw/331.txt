Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 ("O--O") and beat 3 ("--O-").
- **Snare (S):** plays on beats 2 and 4 with a mix of open and closed hits ("Oo-o", "-o--", "O--o").
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** plays on all beats with alternating open and closed hits ("o-O-", "o-O-", "o-O-", "o-O-").

### New instructions:
- No ride cymbal.
- No snare.

---

### Approach:
- Remove the S and R lines.
- Keep the kick as is, possibly reinforcing the groove.
- Since hi-hat is silent, we can add a steady hi-hat pattern to maintain rhythm.

### Final plan:
- Retain the kick pattern.
- Add a consistent closed hi-hat (x) pattern.
- Remove snare and ride lines.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-

This gives a simple, consistent rhythm emphasizing the kick and hi-hat, with the snare and ride eliminated per your request.
