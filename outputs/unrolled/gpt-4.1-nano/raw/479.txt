Since the request is to remove all kick (K) and hi-hat (H), I will delete those lines. The remaining instruments are snare (S), toms (T), cymbals (C), and ride (R).

In the original groove:
- K: has hits on all beats (hard hits)
- H: no activity (all dashes)
- S: plays on beat 2 and 4
- T: no activity
- C: plays on all beats
- R: no activity

To create a new groove without kick and hi-hat, I'll keep the snare and cymbals to maintain rhythm.

Here's my plan:
- Remove K and H lines.
- Keep S on beats 2 and 4 for rhythmic interest.
- Keep C on all beats for steady punctuation.
- T and R remain silent.

**Final pattern:**
- Snare on beats 2 and 4.
- Cymbals on all beats.

### Final drum groove:

K: (removed)
S: ----|--O-|----|--O-
H: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This setup keeps a basic rhythm with snare and cymbals, removing kick and hi-hat as requested.
