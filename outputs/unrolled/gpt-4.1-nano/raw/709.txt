**Thought process:**

- To fulfill the request, I need to add a cymbal hit and hi-hat hit at the very beginning.
- The cymbal (C) is currently `----` in the first beat, so I will change the first beat of C to `O---` to add a crash cymbal hit.
- The hi-hat (H) is currently `X-x-`, which already has an opening hi-hat hit on the first 16th note, so it is already present.
- No need to change H, only C.

**Implementation:**

- K: remains `O--O|----|--O-|----`
- S: remains the same
- H: remains `X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-`
- T: remains the same
- C: change first beat from `----` to `O---` to add cymbal hit.
- R: remains the same

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This includes a cymbal hit and the hi-hat in the very beginning, fulfilling the requirement.
