Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits (O) on various beats, often clustered.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 and 4 ("O---") in measures 2 and 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** hits (O) on every beat, so cymbals are active.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### Goal:
Add a ride cymbal pattern **alongside** the existing cymbals and possibly the tom sounds, as the instruction is to have **not only tom but also ride**.

**Since the cymbals are already present on every beat, and the Toms are silent,** I will:
- Introduce a **ride** cymbal pattern in the ride line (R).
- Keep the existing cymbals (C) active.
- Add tom hits (T) for flavor, e.g., on beat 3 of measure 3 for some rhythmic interest.

---

### Approach:
- Add **ride hits** ("X" or "O") on beats 2 and 4 for a typical ride pattern.
- Keep the existing cymbals (C) as they are, since they already provide crash layers.
- Add a tom hit on measure 3 beat 3 ("--O-") to create some tom flavor.

### Final groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|--O-|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|--X-|----|--X-
@@@
```

**Explanation:**
- Ride hits ("X") on measure 2 beat 4 ("--X-") and measure 4 beat 4 ("--X-").
- Tom hit ("--O-") added on measure 3 beat 3 for flavor.
- Cymbals (C) are still active on all beats.
- The groove now features both ride and toms, with cymbals layered with existing patterns.

This pattern satisfies the requirement of having both ride and toms layered into the groove.
