Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays heavily, with various hits across the bar.
- Snare (S): plays on beats 2 and 4 in some measures.
- Hi-hat (H): silent.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Crash cymbal (C): hits on every beat.
- Ride cymbal (R): silent.

**Request:** no kick and no ride.

Therefore, I will remove the K and R lines, keeping the rest:

- Snare still on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat remains silent (can omit for simplicity).
- Crash cymbal (C) hits on every beat, which adds rhythm, so I will keep it.

### Plan:
- Leave the rack cymbal (C) pattern as is.
- Remove the K and R.
- Keep snare on beats 2 and 4 where present.
- No hi-hat or other instruments.

### Final rhythm:
- Snare on beat 2 in measure 2 and beat 4 in measure 4.
- Crash cymbal on every beat for emphasis.

This creates a clean, rhythmically interesting pattern with cymbals and snare accents, perfect for the specified restrictions.
