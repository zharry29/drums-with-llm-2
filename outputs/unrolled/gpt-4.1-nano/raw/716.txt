**Thought process:**

- To add a hi-hat hit and a ride cymbal at the very start:
  - The hi-hat (H) is currently `X---`, which already has a hit at the first 16th note. To emphasize the hit, I'll change it to a softer closed hi-hat `x---`, if desired, but since the original is `X---`, possibly preferable to keep it.
  - The ride cymbal (R) is currently `----`. To add a ride cymbal hit, change the first beat from `----` to `X---`, indicating a hard ride cymbal hit.
- Keep all other instruments unchanged.

**Final edited groove:**

C: ----|----|----|----
R: X---|----|----|----

**Note:**  
- The hi-hat remains the same (already present).  
- The ride cymbal is added at the start with `X---`.  
- This fulfills the request to have a hi-hat and ride in the very beginning.
