Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 ("O---") and beat 2 (---o), with soft hit at beat 2.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("O---") and beat 4 ("O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes with "o" and "O" pattern on all beats.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbal (C):** hits on beat 1 ("O---").
- **Ride cymbal (R):** silent currently.

**Objective:**  
Incorporate *both* a ride cymbal and reinforce the kick drum.

### Approach:
1. Keep the existing kick pattern, as it already has a strong timing.
2. Add a ride cymbal "O---" on beats 2 and 4 to develop the ride pattern.
3. Keep the ghost hi-hat notes for subtle texture, or enhance if needed.
4. Maintain or slightly reinforce the kick hits if desired.

### Final plan:
- Add ride cymbal hits on beats 2 and 4 ("O---").
- Keep the current kick hits.
- Preserve the hi-hat ghost notes.

**Explanation:**
- Added ride cymbal ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- The kick pattern remains unchanged.
- Hi-hat ghost notes stay consistent.
- Provides a fuller rhythm with both kick and ride supporting the groove.
