Let's examine the current pattern:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 ("O--O") and 3 ("--O-")
- **Snare (S):** hits mostly on beats 2 and 4 with mixed soft and open hits
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent
- **Toms (T):** silent (to be added)
- **Cymbal (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** alternating open and closed hits on every beat

**Goal:** Incorporate a tom pattern along with the kick, for rhythmic variation and fullness.

### Approach:
- Add a tom hit on beat 3 ("-O--") or possibly as a fill at the end of the bar.
- Keep the kick pattern largely similar to maintain rhythm.
- Possibly add a tom hit on beat 4 or just before, to create a fill.
- Keep cymbals and hi-hat silent or minimal for clarity, focusing on the tom and kick.

### Suggested plan:
- Insert a tom hit on beat 3 ("-O--") to add some depth.
- Add a soft kick ("o---") on beat 2 for variation.
- Optionally, put a tom hit on beat 4 ("---o") for some fill.
- Keep the existing snare and cymbal pattern.

### Final groove:

K: --o-|----|--O-|---o
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|-O--|--O-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

```

**Summary:**
- **Kick:** soft hit ("o---") on beat 2, to add variation
- **Tom:** hit on beat 4 ("---o") for fill
- **Snare:** remains as-is
- **Cymbals:** remain silent to focus on the main kit parts
- **Ride:** persists with pattern

This pattern adds a tom fill and some velocity variation in the kick, providing more rhythmic interest while respecting the original structure.
