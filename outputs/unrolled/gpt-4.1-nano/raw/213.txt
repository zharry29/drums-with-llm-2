Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** Hits on beats 1 and 3 ("O---" | "----" | "O---" | "----")
- **Snare (S):** Hits on beats 2 and 4 ("----" | "O---" | "----" | "O---")
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent "X---" across all four beats, playing steady closed hi-hat.
- **Toms (T):** none.
- **Crash (C):** none.
- **Ride (R):** none.

**Task:**  
Add both a cymbal (such as crash or ride) along with the hi-hat. Since the hi-hat is already present, we will keep it. We want to add cymbal hits for more color, which could be:

- Crash cymbals at the start of the bar or on certain beats.
- Ride cymbal hits on other beats to create variation.

### Plan:
- Keep hi-hat as "x---" for a constant rhythmic pulse.
- Add a crash cymbal on beat 1 ("O---").
- Add a ride cymbal on beat 3 ("x---") for variation.
- Optionally, add a crash or ride hit on beat 4 for lift.

### Explanation:
- Crash cymbal ("O---") at beat 1.
- Ride cymbal ("x---") on beats 3 and 4, providing a dynamic lift.
- Steady hi-hat ("x---") for subdivision rhythm.
- Kick and snare remain as they are, balancing the groove.

This combination introduces both cymbal and ride sounds for a more energetic, textured drum pattern.
