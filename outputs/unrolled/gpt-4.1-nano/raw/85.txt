Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 with soft ("o"), and beat 2 with soft ("o"), also on beat 3 with hits.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 and 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** hits on off-beats in each measure with soft open ("o") and alternating open/closed.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** hits on beat 1.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Goal:**  
Add a tom pattern to complement the cymbal pattern and enrich the groove.

### Approach:
- Add a tom hit ("O") in measure 2 or 3 for variety, at a strategic subdivision.
- For a balanced feel, add a tom in measure 2 at subdivision 6.
- Also, include a tom in measure 4 at subdivision 14.

---

### Final plan:
- **Measure 2:** add a tom at subdivision 6 ("--O-")
- **Measure 4:** add a tom at subdivision 14 ("-----O")

---

### Final groove:

```

**Explanation:**
- Added a tom ("O") in measure 2 at subdivision 6.
- Added a tom ("O") in measure 4 at subdivision 14.
- The groove maintains the original elements with enriched tom and cymbal layers for more rhythmic texture.
