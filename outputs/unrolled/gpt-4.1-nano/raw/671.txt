**Thought process:**

- To add a ride hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of R from `----` to `O---` (a ride cymbal on the bell).
- The kick is already present on the first beat of K as `O---`.
- To emphasize both, I will ensure both are present in the first beat.

**Implementation:**

- K: remains `O---` (already a kick in position)
- R: change first beat from `----` to `O---`

---

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

Now, the first beat includes both a kick and a ride cymbal hit, as requested.
