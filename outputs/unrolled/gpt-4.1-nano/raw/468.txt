Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays on all beats, with some variations.
- **Snare (S):** plays on beat 2 and 4 with hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbal (C):** plays on beats 1, 2, 3, 4.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Request:** no snare or kick.

So, we need to remove S and K lines entirely.

Remaining instruments: **H, T, C, R**.

- Since H, T, and R are all silent in the original pattern, and C is active on beats 1-3, but the request is to eliminate snare and kick, we focus on creating a new pattern with only the cymbal C (if desired).

The safest choice is to make a rhythm with just the cymbal, if we want some percussion, or leave everything silent for a very minimal pattern.

Given that only C is active (on beats 1-3), and the request is to remove snare and kick, here is a simple pattern with only the cymbal on beats 1, 2, 3:
