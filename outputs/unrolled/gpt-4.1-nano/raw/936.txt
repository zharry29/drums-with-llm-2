Let's examine the snare line:

- S: `----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o`

Breaking down by beat:
- Beat 1: `----` (no snare)
- Beat 2: `Oo-o` (snare hits in the second beat)
- Beat 3: `-o--` (snare hit at the third 16th note)
- Beat 4: `O--o` (snare hits in the fourth beat)

**The request is to have no snare on beat 4.** Currently, beat 4 has `O--o`, which includes snare hits at the start and the last 16th note.

We need to silence or remove the snare hits on beat 4:
- Change `O--o` to `----`, removing all snare hits in that beat.

**Final answer:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|--o-|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

This fulfills the requirement: no snare on beat 4.
