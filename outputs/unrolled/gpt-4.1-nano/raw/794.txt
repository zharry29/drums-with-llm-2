**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits on the first, second, and last beats
  - Snare (S): hits on the third beat
  - Hi-hat (H): silent
  - Toms (T): alternating soft and hard hits on every subdivision
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): silent

- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and a ride in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - Add a tom hit (`O`) at the very first subdivision in T.
  - Add a ride hit (`O`) at the very first subdivision in R.
