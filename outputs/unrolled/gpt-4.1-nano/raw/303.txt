Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on first and third beats with soft hits ("O---" and "O-O-")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 ("O---" and "O---")
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays a pattern with semi-open and open notes ("--o-", "O-o-")
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Crash (C):** plays on beat 1 in measure 1 only
- **Ride (R):** silent

**Objective:**  
Add a **ride cymbal** (R) pattern, probably on every beat or with some variation, and ensure the **snare** remains prominent or more active.

---

### Approach:
- Add **"O---"** for the ride on all four beats to give a consistent ride pulse.
- Keep the snare pattern on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern for texture.
- Possibly add a crash accent if desired, but it's optional.

---

### Final plan:
- Insert **"O---"** in R line every beat.
- Keep the snare hits on beats 2 and 4 ("O---").
- Maintain the awesome hi-hat pattern.

### Final groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

### **Explanation:**
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4, maintaining a solid backbeat.
- **Ride (R):** hits on every beat, supporting the groove.
- **Hi-hat (H):** adds texture with ghost notes.
- **Kick (K):** remains as in original for rhythm foundation.
- **Crash (C):** unchanged.

This creates a complete, groove-supporting pattern with both ride and snare emphasized.
