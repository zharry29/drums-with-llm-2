To add a tom hit and cymbal in the very beginning, I will analyze the first beat (the first 4 characters in each line) and modify it accordingly.

Original first beat:
- K: O--O
- S: ----
- H: ----
- T: ----
- C: ----
- R: o-O-

Since the request is to add a tom hit and cymbal:
- For the tom, T: O--- (a hard tom hit in the first 16th note)
- For the cymbal, C: O--- (a crash cymbal in the first 16th note)

Currently, the cymbal is already set in the first beat as 'O---', so no change needed there, but I will emphasize adding the tom.

Here's the final edited version, inserting a tom hit in the first beat:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

This adds a tom hit and maintains the cymbal in the initial beat as requested.
