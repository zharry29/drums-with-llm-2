Let's analyze the current groove:

- K (Kick): `O--O|----|--O-|----` — kick hits on beats 1 and 3, and the last sound on beat 3.

- S (Snare): `----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o` — snare hits are on all beats, but especially in beat 2 and 4.

- H (Hi-hat): `X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-` — steady hi-hat hits on every beat's 16th notes.

- T (Toms): `----|----|----|----` — none.

- C (Crash): `----|----|----|----` — none.

- R (Ride): `----|----|----|----` — none initially, but per the groove, the ride is currently silent.

---

**The request:** Remove ride on beat 4. 

**Observation:** The current groove has no ride hits, so it's already complying with that request.

### Final step:

Since the groove already has no ride hits on beat 4, no changes are necessary. To keep clarity, I'll present it as is:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**This version maintains all conditions (including no ride on beat 4) with the original pattern.**
