Let's analyze the original groove to see what needs to be removed:

- Second beat (middle section): 
  - K: ---- (no change needed)
  - S: Oo-o (hit notes on the 5th, 6th, and 8th positions)
  - H: X-x- (hits on notes 5, 7, 9, 11; likely spanning across the beat)
  - T: ---- (nothing to remove)
  - C: ---- (nothing to remove)
  - R: ---- (nothing to remove)

**Goal**: Remove everything in the second beat **(notes 5-8)**.

This means:
- K: remains ---- (no change)
- S: Oo-o → should become ----
- H: X-x- → should become ----
- T: remains ----
- C: remains ----
- R: remains ----

Now, adjusting the groove accordingly:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|----|----|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This clears all the hits in the second beat as instructed.
