Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): all silent.
- Snare (S): all silent.
- Hi-hat (H): plays on beats 2 and 4 with soft hits.
- Toms (T): all silent.
- Cymbals (C and R): R has some hits, C is silent.

**The instruction is to remove all hi-hat and kick.**

So, remove lines K and H, and only keep snare, cymbal R, and possibly other percussion if needed.

The remaining pattern:

S: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Since the snares are silent, and the cymbals are silent, only the ride (R) remains active with some closed and open hits.

**Final decision:**

- Keep the ride pattern as is.
- Remove all other instruments.

The resulting groove:

K: (removed)
S: (removed)
H: (removed)
T: (removed)
C: (removed)
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This pattern highlights the ride cymbal, with an alternating pattern of open and closed hits, providing a rhythmic pulse without hi-hat or kick.
