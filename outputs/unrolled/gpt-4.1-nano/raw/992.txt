Let's consider the instructions carefully:

- Play the **closed hi-hat** (`x` for soft, `X` for hard) on **all 16th notes**.
- **Accent** on the down beats of each quarter note, which correspond to the first (`|`) character of each beat in the bar (beats 1, 2, 3, and 4).

Given the original hi-hat line:
`----|----|----|----`

Change it to:
- Fill every 16th note with a closed hi-hat, either `x` (soft) or `X` (hard).
- Accent these with a hard `X` on the downbeat of each beat (positions 1, 5, 9, 13).

To emphasize the downbeat accents, I will set:
- The first note of each beat (positions 1, 5, 9, 13) to `X` for a strong hit.
- The remaining notes to `x` for softer hits.

### Final hi-hat line:
`Xxxx|xxxx|xxxx|xxxx`

Now, I will update the groove accordingly.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: Xxxx|xxxx|xxxx|xxxx
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

```

This ensures a consistent, accented, and energetic hi-hat pattern, playing on all 16th notes with a strong emphasis on the down beats.
