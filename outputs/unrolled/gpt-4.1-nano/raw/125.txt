Let's analyze what's currently present:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 2 and 3 ("-O--", "OO--", etc.)
- **Snare (S):** silent.
- **Hi-hat (H):** continuous pattern with open and closed hits ("x-x-", etc.)
- **Toms (T):** hits on beat 3 of measure 3 ("---O")
- **Cymbal (C):** hits on every beat (O--- pattern)
- **Ride (R):** silent.

The current groove already has typical cymbals (C) and hi-hats, but no ride cymbal. The instruction is to add a ride along with the existing cymbal.

---

### Approach:
- Keep the existing cymbals (C) as they are.
- Add a **ride cymbal** (R) by placing soft/hard hits on specific beats (commonly on beats 2 and 4).
- For balance, I will add ride hits on measure 2 beat 4 and measure 4 beat 2 to create a relaxed ride pattern.

---

### Final plan:
- Add **ride hits** ("x" or "O") on measure 2 beat 4 and measure 4 beat 2.
- Keep existing cymbal hits for fullness.
- The groove remains energetic but more layered.

### Final groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|---O|----|x---
@@@
```

**Explanation:**
- Ride cymbal (R) added on measure 2 beat 4 ("---O") and measure 4 beat 2 ("x---").
- The existing cymbal (C) remains present on all beats.
- Hi-hat and kick stay consistent.
- Toms remain silent.

This creates a balanced layer with both a cymbal and a ride, enriching the overall texture.
