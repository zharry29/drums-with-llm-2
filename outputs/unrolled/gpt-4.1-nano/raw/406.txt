Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on the first and third beats with soft hits.
- Snare (S): hits on the second and fourth beats.
- Hi-hat (H): plays on every beat with a steady pattern of closed hits ('X').
- Toms (T): silent.
- Crash cymbal (C): silent.
- Ride cymbal (R): silent.

**The request is to remove all hi-hat (H) and cymbals (C and R).**

This leaves us with just the kick and snare patterns:

K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: (remove)  
C: (remove)  
R: (remove)

To make the groove coherent and rhythmic, I will:

- Keep the kick pattern as is.
- Keep the snare pattern as is.
- Remove hi-hat and cymbal parts as requested.

**Final pattern:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: (removed)
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This creates a straightforward basic groove with kick and snare, suitable for many styles.
