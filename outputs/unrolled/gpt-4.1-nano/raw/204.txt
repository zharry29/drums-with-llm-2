Let's analyze what's present now:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 with alternating hard and soft.
- **Snare (S):** only on beat 3 ("O---") in the third bar.
- **Hi-hat (H):** currently silent.
- **Toms (T):** pattern with alternating soft hits ("O-o-") across all four beats, but the prompt says to add hi-hat.
- **Cymbals (C) and Ride (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add in a hi-hat pattern that complements the groove, likely a steady 16th note pattern, possibly with ghost notes or accents.

### Approach:
- Keep the existing drum pattern largely intact.
- Add a consistent hi-hat pattern, probably "x-x-" across all 16th notes to create steady subdivision.
- Maintain the snare on beat 3 to keep the groove grounded.
- Possibly reinforce the kick on beat 1 or 2 for more drive.

---

### Final plan:
- Add hi-hat "x-x-" on all four beats for a steady pattern.
- Keep snare on beat 3.
- Leave kick as is.

### Final groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---

**Summary:**  
- The hi-hat now has a consistent pattern ("x-x-") across all beats, providing a driving subdivision.
- The snare remains on beat 3 for backbeat emphasis.
- The groove is rhythmic and balanced with steady hi-hat subdivision, a strong backbeat, and a classic kick pattern.
