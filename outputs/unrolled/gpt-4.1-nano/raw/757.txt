**Thought process:**

- The original groove:

  - Kick (K): `O---|----|O---|----` — kick on beats 1 and 3.
  - Snare (S): `----|O---|----|O---` — snare on beats 2 and 4.
  - Hi-hat (H): `X---|X---|X---|X---` — hi-hat on every beat, emphasized with X (hard closed).

- The request:

  - To add a hi-hat hit and a kick in the *very first* beat.

- The first beat of K is `O---`, which already contains a hard kick.

- The first beat of H is `X---`, which already has a hi-hat hit.

- Since both are present, it seems the pattern already includes a hi-hat and kick in the very first beat.

- However, to ensure clarity or to reinforce that the first beat definitely includes a hi-hat hit, I will keep these as they are, or possibly make the hi-hat hit more prominent if desired.

- But since the existing pattern already contains these elements, no change is strictly needed.

**Alternatively**, if I interpret the instruction as adding an extra hi-hat hit and kick in the first beat (e.g., making them more emphasized), I could:

- Change the first beat of H from `X---` to `X--X` (adding a hi-hat hit at an additional point), but generally, the initial hits are already appropriate.

- Similarly, the kick is already in the pattern.

**Conclusion:** The original groove already has both a hi-hat and kick in the first beat with the current notation.

**Final version:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**

- The first beat has an open, accented hi-hat (`X---`), and a hard kick (`O---`), satisfying the request fully.
