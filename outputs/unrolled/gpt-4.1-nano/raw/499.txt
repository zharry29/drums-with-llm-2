The instruction is to remove all ride cymbal (R) and toms (T).  
- T line is: `O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-` — remove this line entirely.  
- R line is: `----|----|----|----` — remove this line as well.

Remaining instruments:
- K: `O---|O---|----|O---`
- S: `----|----|O---|----`
- H: `----|----|----|----`
- C: `----|----|----|----`

Since the toms and ride are gone, focus on the kick, snare, and possibly the hi-hat (even though currently silent).  
The kick rhythm is steady, and snare hits are on beat 3.

**Final pattern:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----

This clean version respects the removal of ride cymbal and toms, keeps a solid rhythmic core, and is suitable as a simple, effective pattern.
