Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': O--O|----|--O-|----
  - Kick on beats 1, 3.
- Snare 'S': ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
  - Snare hits on beats 2 and 4, with some variation.
- Hi-hat 'H': ----|----|----|----
  - No hi-hat activity.
- Toms 'T': ----|----|----|----
  - No toms.
- Cymbals 'C': ----|----|----|----
  - No cymbals.
- Ride 'R': o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
  - Cymbal pattern on all beats.

### Requests:
- Remove hi-hat 'H' and tom 'T'.
- Keep kick and snare parts as is, or possibly simplify.

### Strategy:
- Focus on kick and snare for a more straightforward rhythm.
- The ride cymbal can stay since it's a different instrument, but the instruction is to remove hi-hat and toms only, so we keep cymbals intact.
- Simplify snare hits if necessary for clarity.

---

### Final plan:
- Keep the kick pattern as in the original.
- Keep the snare pattern, but possibly make it more rhythmically consistent.
- Remove any other percussion instruments not desired.

### Final groove:

**Explanation:**
- The kick remains strong on beats 1 and 3.
- The snare hits on beats 2 and 4, giving a standard backbeat.
- No hi-hat or toms.
- Keep the cymbals as they are.

This provides a simple, solid rhythm aligned with the request.
