Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): has hits on beats 1, 2, and 4.
- Snare (S): no hits (all "-").
- Hi-hat (H): plays on every "x-x-" pattern, which is consistent across all beats.
- Toms (T): hits on beat 3 with O.
- Cymbals (C): hits on every beat, but since we want no cymbals, these need to be removed.
- Ride (R): no hits.

**Request:** no cymbal or hi-hat.

Steps to edit:

- Remove the cymbal (C) line entirely.
- Remove the hi-hat (H) line entirely.
- Keep the kick (K) pattern.
- Keep the snare (S) unchanged (since no instruction to remove it, and it's part of a typical beat).
- Keep the Toms line as is, since it contains a tom hit on beat 3.

### Final plan:

- Keep kick and snare.
- Keep Toms.
- Remove cymbals and hi-hat.

### Final grove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: (removed)
H: (removed)
R: ----|----|----|----

This maintains a rhythm with kick, snare, and Toms, with no cymbals or hi-hat, fulfilling the request.
