Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3, with some variation ("O--O" | "----" | "--O-" | "----").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 with ghost notes and a soft hit on beat 4 ("----" | "Oo-o" | "-o--" | "O--o").
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent ghost notes ("X-x-") across all beats, providing a tight texture.
- **Toms, Cymbals, Ride:** currently silent.

The goal: incorporate a snare pattern clearly along with cymbals.

### Approach:
- Keep the snare hits, but reinforce or spread their presence across the bar.
- Introduce cymbal hits, like a crash on beat 1 or ride on beats 2 or 4 for added texture.
- Maintain the hi-hat ghost notes for rhythm.

### Implementation:
- Keep the existing snare pattern, but add a snare hit on beat 4 if absent.
- Add a crash cymbal ("O---") at beat 1 for emphasis.
- Possibly add a ride cymbal ("x---") on beat 3 for variation.
- Keep kick pattern as it is to support foundation.

---

### Final plan:
- Crash on beat 1 ("O---")
- Snare on beat 2 ("O---")
- Snare reinforced or added on beat 4 ("O---")
- Ride on beat 3 ("x---") for texture
- Continue ghost notes with hi-hat

### Final groove:

**Summary:**  
- Crash cymbal (O---) on beat 1 for emphasis.  
- Snare ("O---") on beats 2 and 4, with some ghost notes for subtlety.  
- Ride ("x---") on beat 3 for added variation.  
- hi-hat ghost notes remain for texture.

This creates a fuller, more balanced pattern with prominent snare and cymbals, supporting a dynamic rhythm.
