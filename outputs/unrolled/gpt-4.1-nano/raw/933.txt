Let's analyze the current groove:

- Snare line (S): `----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o`
- Beat 4 (the last segment) is: `O--o`

This contains an "O" at the start of beat 4, indicating a snare hit. The request is **no snare on beat 4**, so we need to remove the hit in that segment.

**Steps:**

- Change `O--o` to `----` in the last segment, removing all snare hits on beat 4.

**Other instruments** are already compliant as they donâ€™t have hits in beat 4 that need changing.

Here's the final version:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|----
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This fulfills the request by eliminating snare hits in beat 4.
