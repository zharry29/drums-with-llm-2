**Thought process:**

- The current groove has a soft kick `o---` in the first beat; to emphasize a kick hit at the very beginning, I will change that from `o---` to `O---`. This makes it a hard kick on the first 16th note.
- The ride cymbal (R) pattern is currently `x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-`. To add a ride hit at the very beginning, I will change the first beat of R from `x---` to `O---`.

**Final plan:**  
- K: `O---|--o-|o---|--o-` (change the first `o---` to `O---`)  
- R: `O---|X-x-|x---|X-x-` (if not already, change `x---` to `O---`)

**Note:** The second beat of K currently has `--o-`, which is a soft hit on the third 16th note, so I will leave it as is.

**Final edited groove:**

K: O---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This places a strong kick and a ride cymbal hit at the very start, fulfilling the request.
