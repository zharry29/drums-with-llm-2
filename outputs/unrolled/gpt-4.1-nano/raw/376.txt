Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': hits on beats 1, 2, and 3, with a soft hit on beat 2.
- Snare 'S': hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat 'H': plays on every beat with alternating open and closed hits ('--o-', 'O-o-', etc.).
- Toms 'T': no hits, so nothing to change there.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': no hits.

**Request:** Remove all toms ('T') and ride cymbal ('R') hits.

Since 'T' already has no hits, no change is needed there. 'R' is already empty.

**Approach:** 
- No change needed for 'T' and 'R'.

The groove already satisfies the "no toms or ride" requirement.

**Final version:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This maintains the original pattern but confirms no ride or toms are present, fulfilling the request.
