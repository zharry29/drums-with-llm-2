Let's analyze the original groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The snares are on the second 16th note of measure 2 and 4:
- Measure 2: at the 5th note (O---)
- Measure 4: at the 13th note (O---

Since the user wants to avoid having the snare on the downbeats 2 and 4, I need to move or remove the snare hits from the second and fourth measures' main downbeat positions (notes 5 and 13). 

Currently:
- Measure 2 Snare: "O---" at note 5
- Measure 4 Snare: "O---" at note 13

To avoid snare hits on beat 2 and 4 downbeats, I will remove or shift those hits. A good approach is to change those snare hits to rests ('-') or move them slightly later to a weaker offbeat.

Options:
- Completely remove the snare hits on those downbeats.
- Or shift the snare hits to the offbeat (the 'and' count) after the downbeat.

For simplicity, I will remove the snare hits on the downbeat of 2 and 4.

Modified groove:

- Measure 2: change "O---" to "----"
- Measure 4: change "O---" to "----"

Now the snare is only played in the offbeats or optional positions, perhaps maintaining some subtle rhythm.

Here's the revised notation:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

If you want to keep some snare flavor, maybe you can place them on the "and" counts (the second and fourth 16th notes of each beat). For example, in measure 2 and 4, place 'O' on the second or fourth 16th notes, but not on the downbeat.

An alternative with offbeat snare placements:

Measure 2: "----" (no snare on beat 2 downbeat, but could add on the 'and')
Measure 4: "----" (no snare on beat 4 downbeat, but can add offbeat)

To add some subtle complexity, perhaps:

@@@
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|--O-|----|--O-
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

But since the instruction is to avoid snare on beat 2 and 4 downbeats, the simplest clear version is just removing those hits:

**Final version:**

@@@
K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This removes the snare on the strong downbeats of 2 and 4, following the user's request.
