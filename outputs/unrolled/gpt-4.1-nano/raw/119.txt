Let's analyze the existing groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on first beat ("O---"), softer hit on second beat ("---o"), and on third beat ("O-O-").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 (measure 2) and beat 4 (measure 4).
- **Hi-hat (H):** pattern alternating o and O across measures.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on beats 1, 2, and 3 ("O---" in each measure).
- **Ride (R):** silent.

---

### Goal:
Add **ride cymbal** along with the existing cymbals.

### Approach:
- To introduce a ride cymbal pattern, typically place hits on beats 2 and 4 to match the steady pulse.
- Keep existing cymbal hits.
- Add ride hits ("O" or "o") on beats 2 and 4 in measures 2 and 4.

---

### Final plan:
- In measure 2, add ride hit on beat 2 ("--O-").
- In measure 4, add ride hit on beat 4 ("---O").
- Keep the cymbals as is for fullness.

---

### Final groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|--O-|----|---O

```

**Explanation:**
- **Ride cymbal:** added on measure 2 beat 2 ("--O-") and measure 4 beat 4 ("---O").
- **Cymbals:** remain play on beats 1, 2, and 3.
- The overall pattern now has both cymbal layers, enhancing the rhythm and fullness.

This configuration satisfies the requirement of having both ride and cymbal present!
