Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): soft hits on beats 1 and 3, with some variation.
- Snare (S): hits on beats 2 and 3 with a combination of sidestick hits.
- Hi-hat (H): continuous closed hits on every eighth note.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C): silent.
- Ride (R): mixed open/closed hits with frequent oscillation.

**Given the instruction:** no toms (T) or kick (K).

**Steps:**

1. Remove lines K and T.
2. Keep S, H, C, R.

Now, the groove will consist of snare, hi-hat, cymbal, and ride patterns.

- Snare (S): only on beat 2 with X, no other hits.
- Hi-hat (H): consistent closed hits.
- Cymbals (C): silent, so remove.
- Ride (R): plays on beat 1 with a mixed pattern; keep those relevant parts.

Since C is silent, only S, H, R remain.

### Final plan:

- Keep snare (S): only on beat 2.
- Keep hi-hat (H): steady pattern.
- Keep ride (R): sync with existing pattern, but remove its unnecessary parts.
- Remove the kick and toms.

### Final groove:

S: ----|X---|----|----
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
R: ----|X-x|----|X-x
C: ----|----|----|----
K: (removed)
T: (removed)

This maintains a simple, rhythmically interesting pattern with hi-hat, snare, and ride cymbal, fitting the instruction to remove kick and toms.
