**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits on first beat with multiple hits (`OOO-`, `--O-`, `OOO-`, `-OOO`)
  - Snare (S): hits on second and last beats (`O---`, `O---`)
  - Hi-hat (H): silent
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): hits on first, second, third, and last beats
  - Ride (R): silent

- request:
  - Add a ride hit and a snare in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Add a ride hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in R.
  - Add a snare hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in S.
