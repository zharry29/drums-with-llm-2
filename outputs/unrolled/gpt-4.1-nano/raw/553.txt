The instruction is to remove all snare (S) and tom (T) lines. The remaining patterns should only include kick (K), hi-hat (H), cymbal (C), and ride (R).

- Remove the S line: `----|O---|----|O---`
- Remove the T line: `----|----|----|----` (already silent, can omit)

Remaining lines:
- K: `O---|---o|O-O-|----`
- H: `--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`
- C: `O---|----|----|----`
- R: `----|----|----|----` (silent)

The final pattern should keep the patterns with instruments that are active and omit snare and toms:

**Final version:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----

This meets the requirement to exclude snare and toms, only including the remaining active instruments.
