Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 with varying articulations.
- Snare 'S': plays only in beat 3.
- Hi-hat 'H': silent.
- Toms 'T': plays on all four beats with alternating soft and hard hits ('O-o-').
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': silent.

**Request:** Remove snare 'S' and hi-hat 'H'.

- We'll change 'S' and 'H' lines to all dashes ('-') since those instruments are to be eliminated.

The final pattern will only include kick and toms.

### Final edited groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This keeps the kick and tom pattern, fulfilling the request to eliminate snare and hi-hat, and maintains a rhythmic drive with the remaining elements.
