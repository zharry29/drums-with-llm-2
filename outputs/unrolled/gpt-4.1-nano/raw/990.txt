To fill the entire bar with double kick, I'll replace the K line so that every 16th note has a kick. This means every position in the K line should be an `O`, indicating a hard hit at each note.

Original K line:
`OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO`

Final K line with a kick on every 16th note:
`OOOO|OOOO|OOOO|OOOO`

The rest of the pattern stays unchanged unless further simplification is desired. The goal here is to have continuous kicks throughout the bar for a high-energy effect.

### Final groove:

K: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This pattern features a kick on every 16th note, fulfilling the request to fill the entire bar with double kick.
