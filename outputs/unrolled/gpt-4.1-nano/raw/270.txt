Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays with varying intensity, including soft ("o") and hard ("O").
- **Snare (S):** silent.
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes pattern ("x-x-").
- **Toms (T):** only on the third measure, beat 3 ("---O").
- **Crash (C):** hits on all beats.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add a ride cymbal pattern (probably "R: O---" or similar) and ensure the kick drum remains prominent. Since the current "K" line already plays a few hits, I will reinforce the kick if needed and add the ride cymbal.

### Approach:
1. Keep the existing kick hits.
2. Add ride cymbal hits on beats 2 and 4 ("O---" in R line).
3. Possibly reinforce the kick in the first and third measures if needed.
4. Keep the hi-hat ghost notes as is.

### Implementation:
- Use the ride cymbal on beats 2 and 4 ("O---").
- Keep the kick drum as is.
- Keep the hi-hat ghost notes.

### Final groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: ----|O---|----|O---
R: ----|O---|----|O---

```

### Explanation:
- Added ride cymbal ("O---") in the second measure beat 2 and fourth measure beat 4.
- Kept the kick drum pattern.
- Retained the ghosted hi-hat pattern.
- Reinforced rhythm with both kick and ride cymbal added.
