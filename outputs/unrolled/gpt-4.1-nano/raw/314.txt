Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hard hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 ("O---", "O---", "O---") with a missing pattern on beat 3.
- **Snare (S):** hits only on beat 3 ("O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** no hits.
- **Toms (T):** alternating soft hits ("O-o-", "O-o-", "O-o-", "O-o-") on all four beats.
- **Cymbals (C,R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add cymbal sounds such as crash or ride to enrich the pattern. Since the current groove lacks cymbals, I'll incorporate a crash cymbal accent on beat 1 to emphasize the downbeat, and perhaps a ride cymbal pattern on beats 2, 3, and 4 for continuity.

---

### Approach:
- Add **crash cymbal ("O---")** on beat 1.
- Add **ride cymbal ("O---")** on beats 2, 3, and 4.
- Keep the existing kick, snare, and tom hits.
- Hi-hat remains silent for now; focus on cymbals.

### Final groove:

T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----

```

**Summary:**  
- The crash cymbal on beat 1 provides emphasis.
- Ride cymbal hits on beats 2, 3, 4 support the ride pattern.
- The rest of the pattern remains, creating a fuller, more dynamic rhythmic foundation.
