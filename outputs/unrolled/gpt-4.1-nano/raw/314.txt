Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': O---|O---|----|O---
- Snare 'S': ----|----|O---|----
- Hi-hat 'H': ----|----|----|----
- Toms 'T': O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- Crash 'C': ----|----|----|----
- Ride 'R': ----|----|----|----

**Current notes:**
- The snare is only on measure 3, beat 1.
- Kick hits sporadically.
- Toms are played on every beat with alternating soft and hard hits.
- No cymbals ('C' for crash or 'R' for ride) are currently present.

---

### Objective:
- Add cymbals, particularly a crash cymbal at the start.
- Possibly add ride cymbal pattern for rhythm support.
- Keep or enhance the snare to give a better backbeat.

---

### Approach:
- Place a crash cymbal 'C' at the very start (measure 1, note 1) for emphasis.
- Add ride 'R' on beats 2 and 4 to reinforce rhythm.
- Keep snare 'S' on measure 3 to keep the groove lively.

---

### Final plan:
- Crash 'C' on measure 1, note 1.
- Ride 'R' on beats 2 and 4 (measure 2, notes 5-8 and 13-16).
- Snare 'S' remains on measure 3, note 3.
- Keep Toms pattern active for rhythm.

**Summary:**
- Crash cymbal 'C' added at start for punch.
- Ride cymbal 'R' on beats 2 and 4 (measure 2 and 4).
- Snare on measure 3 for drive.
- Toms provide rhythmic texture.
- Hi-hat remains silent for now, keeping the groove open for variation.

This arrangement introduces cymbals while retaining the lively tom and kick pattern for a dynamic groove.
