Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beats 1 and 3 with soft and hard hits.
- Snare (S): hits on beats 2 and 4, with some open and sidestick hits.
- Hi-hat (H): steady pattern of closed hi-hat hits on all beats.
- Toms (T), Cymbals (C), Ride (R): no hits.

**Request:** no cymbal or snare.

This means I will:

- Remove the snare (S) and cymbal (C) lines.
- Keep the kick and hi-hat patterns since they do not involve cymbals or snare.
- Toms and ride are silent, so no change needed there.

### Final plan:

- Keep kick pattern as is.
- Keep hi-hat pattern as is.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: (removed)
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This creates a simple, steady rhythm with kick drums and hi-hat, fulfilling your request to eliminate snare and cymbal.
