Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): no hits.
- Snare (S): no hits.
- Hi-hat (H): plays closed hits on the second beat with x--- and x--- pattern.
- Toms (T): no hits.
- Cymbals (C, R): only R (ride) plays with the X-x pattern on beats 2 and 4, with some variation.

**Request:** remove all toms and kick.

That already removes T and K lines (both empty or no hits), and we want to remove any remaining instruments related to kick and toms, which are not present.

But the existing groove mainly contains only hi-hat and ride cymbal, which should stay.

To provide a cleaner, minimalistic pattern focusing on cymbals and keeping the groove interesting, I will:

- Keep the ride cymbal pattern.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern.
- Remove the rest (which are empty), resulting in a simple pattern with command instruments only.

### Final groove:

S: ----|----|----|----
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-

This pattern maintains a steady hi-hat, and the ride cymbal plays on beats 2 and 4, with no kick or toms, as requested.
