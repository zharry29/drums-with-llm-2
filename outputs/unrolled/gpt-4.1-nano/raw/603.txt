To add a tom hit and cymbal at the very beginning, I need to modify the first beat (first 4 characters in each line).

Current first beat:
- K: -O--
- S: ----
- H: x-x-
- T: ----
- C: O---
- R: ----

I will:
- Add a tom hit: T: O---
- Add a cymbal (crash or ride): C: O---

I'll replace the first beat parts accordingly:

- K: -O--
- S: ----
- H: x-x-
- T: O---
- C: O---
- R: ----

**Note:** Since there's no cymbal in the first bar, and the existing C: O--- indicates a crash in the first beat, I will keep the cymbal as is and just add the tom hit.

Final edited version:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: O---|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This configuration adds a tom hit in the first beat, and keeps the cymbal sound as is, in line with the request.
