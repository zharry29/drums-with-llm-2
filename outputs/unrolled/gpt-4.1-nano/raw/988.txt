To fill the entire bar with double kick, I will replace the K line so that every 16th note in the measure has a kick, using `O` (hard hit) for clarity.

The original K line:
`o---|--o-|o---|--o-`

For a full double kick pattern, this should become:
`OOOO|OOOO|OOOO|OOOO`

**This ensures every 16th note has a kick.**

Other instruments stay as they are unless further simplification is needed. Since the request is only to fill the whole bar with double kicks, the main change is the K line.

### Final groove:

K: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

```

This completes the bar with continuous double kicks while keeping the rest of the pattern intact.
