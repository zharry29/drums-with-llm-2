**Thought process:**

- To add a ride hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of R from `x---` to `O---` (assuming "hit" on the ride with a normal attack).
- To add a kick in the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `o---` to `O---` (a standard kick hit).

Since both are already `O---` or similar, I only need to ensure the first beat has a kick `O` and a ride `O`.

- For the kick, change the first beat from `o---` to `O---`.
- For the ride, change the first beat from `x---` to `O---`.

---

**Implementation:**

- K: `O---` (from `o---`)
- R: `O---` (from `x---`)

Other instruments remain unchanged.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This now includes a ride and kick hit in the very beginning, meeting your specifications.
