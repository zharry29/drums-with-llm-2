Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays at beat 1 (hard) and beat 2 (soft).
- Snare (S): hits on beats 2 and 4 with various articulations.
- Hi-hat (H): plays a pattern of open and closed hits on every subdivision.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C): plays on beat 1.
- Ride (R): silent.

**Requested change:** no kick or ride.

This means:

- Remove the K and R lines.
- Keep snare (S) and hi-hat (H) as they contribute to rhythm.
- Remove the cymbal (C) since it's not critical and there's no mention to keep it explicitly, but I will keep it to maintain rhythmic richness if desired.

Considering the original groove, I will:

- Remove the K and R lines.
- Keep snare with hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep hi-hat pattern of steady closed hits.
- Keep the cymbal if desired for extra percussive texture.

**Final plan:**

- Snare on beats 2 and 4.
- Steady closed hi-hat all the time.
- Keep cymbal on beat 1 for emphasis (optional).

### Final version:

S: ----|--O-|----|--O-
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
C: O---|----|----|----
R: (removed)
K: (removed)
T: (removed)

This results in a minimalist but dynamic rhythm with snare and hi-hat, and optional cymbal accent, fitting the request to remove kick and ride.
