Let's first count the total number of notes in the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** O--- | O--- | ---- | O--- — 3 notes
- **Snare (S):** ---- | ---- | O--- | ---- — 1 note
- **Hi-hat (H):** ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- — 0 notes
- **Toms (T):** O-o- | O-o- | O-o- | O-o- — 4 notes (each beat has 2 notes, total 8 notes, but since the limit is 8, I need to reduce)

Total: 3 (kick) + 1 (snare) + 0 (hi-hat) + 8 (toms) = 12 notes, exceeding the limit.

### Goal:
Limit total notes to 8 or fewer.

### Strategy:
- Keep the most essential hits:
  - Kick on beat 1.
  - Snare on beat 3.
  - Remove toms or keep only a few.
- Reduce tom hits significantly to stay within limit.

---

### Adjusted plan:
- Keep **Kick** on beat 1 (O---).
- Keep **Snare** on beat 3 (O---).
- Remove all Toms for simplicity, reducing total notes.
- Keep some soft hi-hat or omit altogether, as long as total stays under 8.

---

### Final plan:
- Kick: O--- on beat 1.
- Snare: O--- on beat 3.
- No toms.
- No hi-hat.

Total notes: 2 (kick + snare).

Alternatively, add a single hi-hat note for rhythmic pulse without exceeding 8 total notes.

**Total notes: 2** — well within the 8 notes limit, keeps a simple rhythm, and fulfills the request.
