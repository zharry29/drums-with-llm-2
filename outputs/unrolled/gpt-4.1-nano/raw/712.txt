**Thought process:**
- The goal is to add a hi-hat hit and a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning.
- The hi-hat (H) is currently `--o-`, which shows a soft open hi-hat on the third 16th note of the first beat.
  - To emphasize a hit at the very start, change the first beat of H from `--o-` to `x---` so a closed hi-hat hit occurs in the first 16th note.
- The ride cymbal (R) is currently `----` in the first beat.
  - To add a ride cymbal hit, change the first beat of R from `----` to `X---` (a hard closed bow hit).

**Changes not affecting other parts:**
- Keep the rest of the groove intact, only adjusting H and R for the new hits.

This now includes a hi-hat hit and a ride cymbal in the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
