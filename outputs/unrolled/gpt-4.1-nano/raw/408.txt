Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on the first, third, and last beats.
- Snare (S): plays on the third beat.
- Hi-hat (H): plays on every eighth note with soft open hits.
- Toms (T): plays on every other eighth note (alternating o and O, with O-o pattern).
- Cymbals (C and R): silent.

**The request is to remove all hi-hat (H) and cymbals (C and R).**

This leaves us with only kick and snare, and the toms pattern (which is quite active). Since the user wants no cymbals or hi-hat, the simplest approach is:

- Keep the kick pattern.
- Keep the snare on the third beat.
- Keep the tom pattern.
- Remove the hi-hat and cymbals.

The original completes with:

K: O---|O---|----|O---  
S: ----|----|O---|----  
H: ----|----|----|---- (remove)  
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-  
C: ----|----|----|---- (remove)  
R: ----|----|----|---- (remove)

Final version:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
H: (removed)
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This keeps the active kick and snare, along with the lively tom pattern, and removes all hi-hat and cymbal sounds as requested.
