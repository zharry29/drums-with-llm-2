Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits at the start ("O") in measures 1 and 3.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4, with some open and sidestick hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** alternating open and closed bell hits on off-beats.

**Goal:**  
Add a tom pattern along with cymbals to enrich the texture. Since the current groove has no cymbal, I will introduce ride cymbal hits and also add some toms.

### Approach:
- Add a tom hit ("O") in measure 2 at subdivision 6 for fill.
- Add a tom hit ("O") in measure 4 at subdivision 14 for variation.
- Add ride cymbal hits ("R") in measures 2 and 4 at matching subdivisions to accentuate.

### Final pattern:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|--O-|----|-----O
C: ----|--R-|----|--R-
R: ----|--R-|----|--R-

```

**Summary:**  
- T: added in measure 2 at subdivision 6 and in measure 4 at subdivision 14 for tom layers.  
- R: ride cymbal hits in measures 2 and 4 at corresponding subdivisions, acting as accents and complementing the tom fills.

This creates a more layered, dynamic groove with both cymbal and tom elements, matching the request.
