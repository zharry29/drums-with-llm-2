**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits at first (`O---`) and third  (`O-O-`)
  - Snare (S): hits on second (`O---`) and last (`O---`)
  - Hi-hat (H): hits on various subdivisions with open and closed sounds
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): hits on first beat
  - Ride (R): silent

- Request:
  - Add a snare hit and a ride in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Place a snare (`O`) at the first subdivision in S
  - Place a ride (`O`) at the first subdivision in R

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: O---|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

**Now, the groove includes a snare and a ride hit at the very beginning, as requested.**
