The instruction is to remove the kick (K) and snare (S) lines:

- K: `----|----|----|----` (already silent)
- S: `----|----|----|----` (already silent)

Remaining instruments:
- H: `----|x---|----|x---`
- T: `----|----|----|----` (silent)
- C: `----|----|----|----` (silent)
- R: `x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-`

Since only hi-hat and ride cymbals are active, I can create a more lively pattern. Let's add some variation, such as alternating closed hi-hat hits with some open hits on the last beat, and perhaps a soft ride hit on the second and fourth beats.

Final pattern:

H: x-x-|----|x-x-|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: --O-|----|--O-|----

This keeps a rhythmic consistency with hi-hat, adds some ride cymbal accents, and leaves the percussion interesting without kick or snare.
