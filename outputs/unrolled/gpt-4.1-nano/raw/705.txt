**Thought process:**

- To fulfill the request, I need to add a cymbal hit and a hi-hat in the very first beat.
- The cymbal hit is best suited on the crash cymbal (C), so I will change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---`.
- The hi-hat pattern is currently `X---`; to emphasize the first beat, I will change the first beat of H from `X---` to `x---` (soft closed hi-hat). 
- Other parts stay unchanged.

---

**Final plan:**

- K: remains `O---`
- S: remains `----|O---|----|O---` (no change)
- H: from `X---` to `x---` (adding a hi-hat in the first beat)
- C: from `----` to `O---` (adding a cymbal hit in the first beat)
- T and R: no change

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|X---|X---|X---
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds a cymbal hit and a hi-hat in the very first beat, as requested.
