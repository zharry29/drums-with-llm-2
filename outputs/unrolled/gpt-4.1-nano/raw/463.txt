Let's examine the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays on beats 1, 3 with soft and hard hits.
- Snare (S): plays on beats 2 and 4 with various open and sidestick notes.
- Hi-hat (H): has consistent closed hits on every beat.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C): silent.
- Ride (R): silent.

**Request:** no hi-hat or snare.

Therefore, I will remove the H and S lines entirely, leaving only the kick and the other silent instruments. Since only the kick has actual hits, the groove will be simplified to just the kick pattern.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: (removed)
H: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This provides a simple, clean pattern with only the kick drum, matching your specifications.
