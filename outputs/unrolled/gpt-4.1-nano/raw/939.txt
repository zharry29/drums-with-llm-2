Let's analyze the kick line (K):

- K: `-O--|OO--|---O|-OO-`

Breakdown by beats:
- Beat 1: `-O--` (soft kick at 2nd 16th note)
- Beat 2: `OO--` (hard kicks at 1st and 2nd 16th notes)
- Beat 3: `---O` (hard kick at 4th 16th note)
- Beat 4: `-OO-` (soft/hard kicks at 2nd and 3rd 16th notes)

The instruction is **no kick on beat 4**:
- Therefore, `-OO-` in beat 4 should be changed to `----`, removing all kick hits in that beat.

**Modified line:**
- Replace `-OO-` with `----`.

**Final updated groove:**

K: -O--|OO--|---O|----
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This satisfies the requirement by removing kick hits from beat 4, and the rest of the groove remains unchanged.
