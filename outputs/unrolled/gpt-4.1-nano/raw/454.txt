Let's review the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beat 1 (hard) and beat 3 (soft).
- Snare (S): hits on beat 2 and beat 4, with some open and sidestick hits.
- Hi-hat (H): continuous closed hits.
- Toms (T), Cymbals (C), Ride (R): silent.

The request is to remove all cymbals and hi-hat.

**Approach:**

- Remove lines H and C.
- Keep K and S for musical interest.
- Leave T and R unchanged (they are silent).

**Final plan:**

- Only the kick and snare remain, creating a simple rhythm.
