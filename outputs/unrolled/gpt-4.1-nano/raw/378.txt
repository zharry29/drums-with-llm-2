Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': hits on beats 1 and 3 with soft and hard hits.
- Snare 'S': hits on beats 2 and 4, mixed open and closed hits.
- Hi-hat 'H': plays on every beat with alternating open and closed hits ('X-x-').
- Toms 'T': no hits, so nothing to change.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': no hits, so nothing to change.

**Request:** Remove all kick ('K') and toms ('T').

- Since 'T' has no hits, no change needed there.
- For 'K', remove its hits: change the 'K' line to all '-'.

### Final edited groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This completely removes the kick drum, fulfilling the request, while keeping the rest of the groove intact.
