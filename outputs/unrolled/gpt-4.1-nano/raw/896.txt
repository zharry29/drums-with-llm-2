Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** O---|----|O---|----
  - 2 hits: first beat, third beat.
- **Snare (S):** ----|O---|----|O---
  - 2 hits: second and fourth beats.
- **Hi-hat (H):** X---|X---|X---|X---
  - 4 hits: steady on every beat.
- **Toms (T):** ----|----|----|----
  - none.
- **Crash (C):** ----|----|----|----
  - none.
- **Ride (R):** ----|----|----|----
  - none.

Total hits: 2 (kick) + 2 (snare) + 4 (hi-hat) = 8 hits.

Actually, that fits exactly at the limit, so maybe I just need to confirm or slightly reduce for clarity.

**But,** I want to ensure it fits the request of *no more than* 8 notes, so I might reduce a hi-hat hit for simplicity or variation.

### Approach:

- Keep kicks on 1 and 3.
- Keep snare on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep hi-hat steady but possibly remove one hit.
- Could remove one hi-hat for simplicity.
- Keep total hits under 8.

---

### Final plan:

- Kick on beat 1.
- Snare on beat 2.
- Keep hi-hat on beat 1 only.
- Other instruments silent.

**Total hits:** 1 kick + 1 snare + 1 hi-hat = 3, well within limits, keeps a simple grounded rhythm.  
*Alternatively*, if you want a slightly busier pattern, you could add one more hi-hat on beat 3, but the above remains minimal and within 8 total notes.
