Let's examine the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 ("O--O") and beat 3 ("--O-")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 ("Oo-o") and 4 ("O--o")
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent
- **Toms (T):** silent (to be added)
- **Cymbals (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** pattern alternating "o-O-"/"o-O-" on all beats, providing a rhythmic pulse

### Objective:
Add the toms in a way that enriches the rhythm without disrupting the existing feel.

### Approach:
- Use the existing pattern to introduce a tom hit on beat 3 or 4 for fill, for example, on beat 3 ("--O-") or beat 4 ("--O-").
- Provide some rhythmic fills to complement the energy.
- Keep the existing kick, snare, and cymbal patterns.

---

### Implementation plan:
- Add a tom hit on beat 3 ("--O-") as a punch.
- Add a tom hit on beat 4 ("---O") as further fill.
- Keep the pattern of kick and snare as is.

---

### Final groove:

This version introduces a tom punch on beat 3 and a fill on beat 4, enriching the groove with more percussive variation while keeping the original rhythm direction.
