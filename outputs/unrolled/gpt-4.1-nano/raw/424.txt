Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beat 1 and 3 with soft and hard hits.
- Snare (S): hits on beats 2 and 4 with various articulations.
- Hi-hat (H): continuous closed hits on every eighth note.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C and R): silent.

**Request: remove all toms and kick parts.**

Steps:

1. Remove lines K and T.
2. Keep the snare and hi-hat, as they contribute rhythm.
3. Since the original groove has hi-hat playing throughout, and snare hits on beats 2 and 4, we can maintain the snare pattern and hi-hat pattern for rhythm continuity.

**Resulting pattern:**

S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
K: (removed)
T: (removed)

This maintains the snare accents on the backbeats, with the hi-hat giving a steady pulse, while removing kick and toms as per the request.
