**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `OOO-`, `--O-`, `OOO-`, `OOO`
  - Snare (S): rests
  - Hi-hat (H): rests
  - Toms (T): rests
  - Crash (C): hits on first, second, third, and fourth beats
  - Ride (R): rests

- Request:
  - Add a ride hit (`O`) and hi-hat (`x`) in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Place a ride hit (`O`) at the first subdivision of R
  - Add a hi-hat `x` at the first subdivision of H

**Final groove:**

K: OOO-|-O-O-|-OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|----|----|----

**This now has a ride hit and a hi-hat in the very beginning, as requested.**
