Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** silent
- **Snare (S):** silent
- **Hi-hat (H):** Ghost notes on beat 2 ("x---") and beat 4 ("x---")
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** pattern of closed hits ("x---" on beat 1, beat 3, and "X-x-" on beat 2 and 4), with some closed hits on the bow ("X," "x").  
  Actually, the existing pattern of "X-x-" in R indicates some rhythmic pattern that can support the groove.

**Goal:**
Incorporate explicit ride cymbal hits into the groove, preferably on beats 2 and 4, to add a steady ride pattern, while maintaining the hi-hat ghost notes.

### Implementation plan:
- Place ride hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4 in the R line.
- Keep existing ghost notes and pattern support.

### Final groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----

This pattern introduces the ride cymbal on beats 2 and 4, complementing the ghosted hi-hats and the rest of the pattern, for a complete rhythmic texture.
