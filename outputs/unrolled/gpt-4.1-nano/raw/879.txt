Let's analyze the original groove:

- K (Kick): O---|---o|O-O-|----
- S (Snare): ----|O---|----|O---
- H (Hi-hat): --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- T (Toms): ----|----|----|----
- C (Crash): O---|----|----|----
- R (Ride): ----|----|----|----

The focus is on the snare (S), which currently hits:
- On measure 2, beat 1: "O---" (snare on the first note of the beat, which is the downbeat of measure 2) – this needs to be avoided.
- On measure 4, beat 1: "O---" – again, the downbeat, which needs to be avoided.

The instruction is **to avoid having the snare on the downbeat of 2 and 4**. The current groove already has snare hits on downbeats of measures 2 and 4, so we need to move or remove those.

**Solution:**
- Remove the snare hits at the first note of measure 2 and measure 4.
- To maintain rhythm, we can replace those with offbeat hits or rests.

Let's revise:
- Measure 2, beat 1: replace "O---" with "---" (no snare)
- Measure 4, beat 1: replace "O---" with "---"

 The rest of the pattern remains intact: no snare on the downbeats of 2 and 4.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adjustment ensures snare is not on the downbeats of measures 2 and 4, fulfilling the request.
