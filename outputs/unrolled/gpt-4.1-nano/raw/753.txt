**Thought process:**

- The original groove:

  - Kick (K): `OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO` (kick played in first beat with hard hits)
  - Snare (S): `----|O---|----|O---` (snare on beats 2 and 4)
  
- The request:

  - Add both a snare and a kick in the *very first* beat.
  - The first beat currently has `OOO-` for K, which includes multiple kicks â€” so we keep that.
  - The first beat of S is `----`, so we need to change it to include a snare hit.

- To include a snare in the first beat, change S's first beat from `----` to `O---` (a hard snare).

**Finaled version:**

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: O---|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**

- The first beat now has a kick (`O`) and a snare (`O`), fulfilling the request while keeping the rest unchanged.
