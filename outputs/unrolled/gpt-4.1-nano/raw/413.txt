Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): soft hits on the first and third beats.
- Snare (S): plays on the second and third beats with various stick hits.
- Hi-hat (H): plays on the second and last beats with soft hits.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Crash (C): silent.
- Ride (R): plays on all four beats with mixed open/closed hits and soft/hard articulations.

**The user requests no hi-hat or cymbals.**

This means removing lines H, C, and R.

Remaining lines:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-  
S: ----|X---|--X-|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-  

Only the first two lines (kick and snare) matter now.

**Final step:**

- Keep the kick pattern as is.
- Keep the snare pattern as is.
- Remove hi-hat and cymbals.

**Final output:**

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This creates a straightforward rhythm suitable for many styles, with just kick and snare.
