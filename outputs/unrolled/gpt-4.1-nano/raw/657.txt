**Thought process:**
- To add a snare hit at the very beginning, I will change the first beat of S from `----` to a snare hit, such as `S---`.
- To add a cymbal at the very beginning, I will change the first beat of C from `O---` to a cymbal hit, such as `O---`. Since it's already a cymbal hit, I can leave it or enhance it if needed. But for clarity, I will replace it with a more emphasized cymbal hit, e.g., `O---`.

**Implementation:**
- S: `S---` (snare hit)
- C: `O---` (cymbal hit, already present)

---

**Final groove:**

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: S---|----|----|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This introduces the snare hit and cymbal at the very beginning.
