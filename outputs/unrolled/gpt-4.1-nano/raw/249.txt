Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 ("O--O") and 3 ("--O-")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 with varying articulation ("---|Oo-o|-o--|O--o")
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent
- **Toms (T):** silent (to be added)
- **Cymbals (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** played with alternating open/closed hits on the bell, pattern of "o-O-"

### Objective:
Add toms to this groove for more rhythmic variation, fills, or accents. The groove already has dynamic patterning on the ride and snare, so adding toms can enhance fills and transitions.

### Approach:
- Place a tom hit on beat 3 ("--O-") for a punch.
- Place a tom hit on beat 4 ("-O--") for a fill.
- Keep existing elements intact.

**Summary:**
- Toms are now played on beats 3 ("--O-") and 4 ("-O--") creating fills and rhythmic transitions.
- The groove maintains the original momentum with added percussion depth.
