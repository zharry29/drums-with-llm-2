**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): hits on the first, second, and last beats
  - Snare (S): hits on the third beat
  - Hi-hat (H): silent
  - Toms (T): alternating between O and o every other subdivision
  - Crash cymbal (C): silent
  - Ride cymbal (R): silent

- Request:
  - Add a cymbal hit (crash) and ride in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - Add crash cymbal (`O`) at the first beat in C.
  - Add ride cymbal (`O`) at the first beat in R.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

**This includes a cymbal and ride hit at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.**
