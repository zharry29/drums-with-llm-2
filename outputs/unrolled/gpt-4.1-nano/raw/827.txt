**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O--O`, `----`, `--O-`, `----`
  - Snare (S): `----`, `Oo-o`, `-o--`, `O--o`
  - Hi-hat (H): all rests
  - Toms (T): all rests
  - Crash (C): all rests
  - Ride (R): `o-O-`, `o-O-`, `o-O-`, `o-O-`

- Request:
  - Add a ride hit and hi-hat in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - Place a ride hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in R
  - Place a hi-hat hit (`x`) at the first subdivision in H

**Final edited groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: x---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-
@@@

**Note:** The previous R pattern `o-O-` is modified to `O-O-` at the first beat to include the ride hit in the first subdivision, matching the openness pattern in the rest of the bar.

**This version now includes a ride hit and a hi-hat in the very beginning as you requested.**
