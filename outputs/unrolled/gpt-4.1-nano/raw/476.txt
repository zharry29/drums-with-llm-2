Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays on beats with a mix of hard and soft hits.
- Snare (S): plays on beat 3 in the third measure.
- Hi-hat (H): plays steady alternating closed hits.
- Toms (T): plays on beat 3 in measure 3.
- Cymbals (C): plays on beats 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Ride (R): silent.

**Request:** No snare or kick.

This means removing **K** and **S** lines completely.

Remaining instruments: **H**, **T**, **C**, **R**.

- The **C** plays on beats 1, 2, 3, 4, so keep it for continuity.
- The **H** provides a steady rhythm.
- Toms are only played in measure 3, beat 3, so perhaps we can keep it or keep it silent for simplicity.
- R is silent, so can be omitted.

### Final plan:

- Remove **K** and **S** lines.
- Keep **H**, **C**.
- Keep T if desired, or keep it silent for simplicity.

For variation, I'll keep the hi-hat steady and the cymbal pattern.

### Final groove:

K: (removed)
S: (removed)
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This keeps a simple, energetic rhythm with hi-hat and cymbal.
