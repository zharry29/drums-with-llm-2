Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick hits are on beats 1, 2, and 4, with some soft hits, giving some low-end presence.
- Snare hits on beat 3.
- Toms are playing with alternating soft and loud hits on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Cymbals and ride are silent.

### Objective:
Make the pattern emphasize **more low frequency sounds** â€” mainly focusing on bass drum, toms, and minimizing higher-end percussion.

### Approach:
- Strengthen the kick drum presence, possibly on every beat.
- Add or emphasize toms for depth and low frequencies.
- Reduce or remove high-frequency sounds (none are present besides the toms here), so focus on making the bass and toms more prominent.

### Implementation:
- Place kick hits on all downbeats with some added soft hits for groove.
- Keep or intensify tom hits to create a bassy, growly texture.
- Keep snare silent or move its influence to the low end if needed.

### Final groove:

### Explanation:
- The kick now hits on every beat for a stronger low-end foundation.
- Toms continue with soft and loud hits, emphasizing low frequencies.
- Snare and cymbals are silent for maximal low-frequency emphasis.

This pattern emphasizes bass-heavy, low-frequency sounds suitable for a heavier or more grounded sound.
