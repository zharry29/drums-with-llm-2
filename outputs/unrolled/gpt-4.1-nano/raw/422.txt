Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beats 1 and 3 with a soft hit in beat 2.
- Snare (S): plays on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat (H): plays a pattern with soft open and closed hits on every eighth note.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C): hits on beat 1.
- Ride (R): silent.

**The request:** remove all hi-hat and kick.

**Steps:**

1. Remove lines K and H
2. Keep S, C, R, T - but R, T are silent in this groove, so only S and C matter.
3. Since the snare and cymblast are active, we'll keep them, perhaps simplifying or maintaining their rhythm.

Here's the resulting pattern after removing K and H:

@@@
S: ----|O---|----|O---
C: O---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
K: (removed)
H: (removed)

This simplifies the groove, emphasizing snare and cymbals, giving a clear rhythmic drive.

**Final version:**

@@@
S: ----|O---|----|O---
C: O---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This is the groove with no hi-hat or kick, as requested.
