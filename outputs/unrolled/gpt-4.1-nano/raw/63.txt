Let's analyze what's currently present:

- **Kick (K):** has hits on beats 2 and 4 in various positions.
- **Snare (S):** only in the third measure, on beat 1.
- **Hi-hat (H):** played with alternating closed/hard hits ("x" and "X") on every subdivision, providing a steady pattern.
- **Toms (T):** only in measure 3 on beat 3.
- **Crash (C):** hits on the first three beats of each measure.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

---

### Goal:
**Add a ride cymbal to accompany the hi-hat,** providing a typical drum set texture with both ride and hi-hat playing.

### Approach:
- Keep the existing hi-hat pattern.
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O") on off-beats or on downbeats for a flowing ride pattern.
- Possibly add a crash at measure 4 beat 4 for ending emphasis.

### Final plan:
- Insert ride hits ("O") on beats 2 and 4, complementing the hi-hat.
- Keep the crash cymbals at the start of measures for accent.
- Keep existing kick and snare pattern for rhythm.

### Final groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: -O--|---O|--O-|--O-
@@@
```

**Explanation:**
- The ride cymbal ("O") now plays on beat 2 and beat 4 in measures 2 and 4, adding a flowing rhythmic layer.
- The hi-hat pattern remains, supporting the overall rhythmic stability.
- Crash cymbals at the start of measures remain for emphasis.

This enriches the groove with both ride and hi-hat, providing a full sound typical for a lively drum pattern.
