Let's analyze what the current groove has:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1, 4 ("O---" in measures 1 and 4, "O---" in measure 2)
- **Snare (S):** on beat 3 in measure 3 ("O---")
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent
- **Toms (T):** doing soft hits on all four beats ("O-o-")
- **Cymbals (C) and Ride (R):** silent

---

### Objective:
- Add support for the kick drum by including more kick hits, particularly on beats 2 and 3 if possible.
- Keep or enhance cymbal usage, since the original has none.
- Maintain the existing musical feel and DRUM pattern.

---

### Approach:
- Insert a kick beat on beat 2 ("O--"), so that the kick pattern becomes more driving.
- Possibly add a cymbal hit (like a crash "O---") at the beginning or on key beats.
- Keep existing snare and tom patterns.

---

### Final decision:
- Place kick hits ("O---") on beats 1, 2, and 4, and add a crash cymbal at the start of the measure for fullness.

### Final groove:

```

**Summary:**
- Kick is now on beats 1, 2, and 4 ("O---" each), to give the pattern more energy.
- Crash cymbal added at the start of measure 1 ("O---").
- Snare and hi-hat retained.
- The tom pattern is unchanged, fitting into the groove.

This creates a more balanced foundation with both kick and cymbal support.
