Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays on every subdivision with closed hits ("X").
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

---

### Objective:

Add a *ride* cymbal along with the existing cymbals (hi-hat and possibly others). Since the groove already has closed hi-hat hits, we want a ride pattern that complements it, typically on beats 1 and 3 or on the "and" counts, creating a layered cymbal sound.

### Approach:

- Keep the existing hi-hat pattern.
- Introduce *ride* hits ("O") on beats 1 and 3, and possibly on some off-beats like subdivisions 6 and 14 to add groove.

---

### Final plan:

- Keep H: "X---" pattern for steady hi-hat.
- Add R: "O---" on beats 1 and 3, plus a few off-beats for more texture.

### Final notation:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---

R: O---|----|O---|----

**Summary:**

- Ride ("O") hits on beats 1 and 3 in the respective measures.
- Hi-hat remains consistent.
- The combination layers the cymbals for a fuller sound suited for a dynamic rhythm.
