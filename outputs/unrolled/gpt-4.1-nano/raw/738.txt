**Thought process:**

- The original groove has no cymbal (C) or snare (S) hits at the very start.
- The request is to add a cymbal hit and a snare hit in the very beginning.
- For the snare (S), change the first beat from `----` to `O---`.
- For the cymbal (C), add a hit in the first beatâ€”since the current is `----`, I will change it to a crash cymbal hit, such as `O---`.

**Implementation:**

- S first beat: `O---`
- C first beat: `O---`

---

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: O---|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:** Now, the very first beat has both a snare and a cymbal hit, as requested.
