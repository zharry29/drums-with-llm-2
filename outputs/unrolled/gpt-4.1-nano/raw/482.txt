Since the instruction is to remove all kick (K) and hi-hat (H), I will delete those lines entirely. The remaining instruments are snare (S), Toms (T), Cymbals (C), and Ride (R).

Original groove:
- K: plays on beats 1 and 3.
- S: plays on beat 2 and 4.
- H: plays on beats 1 through 4, with X for closed hi-hat hits.
- T, C, R: silent.

To conform:
- Remove **K** and **H** lines.
- Keep the **S** line because it provides rhythmic backbeat.
- Keep other lines (T, C, R) quiet for simplicity.

The resulting pattern is:

```plaintext
K: (removed)
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
```

This provides a simple, clear rhythmic pattern driven by the snare, since kick and hi-hat are removed.
