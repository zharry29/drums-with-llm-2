To accommodate the request for a cymbal hit and a kick at the very beginning, I will make the following changes:

1. Add a cymbal hit in the first beat: change C: ---- to C: O---
2. Since there is already a kick in the first beat (K: o---), I will leave it as is.

This will emphasize both the cymbal crash and the soft kick at the start.

**Final plan:**
- K: o--- (existing, remains)
- C: ---- â†’ O---

Here is the updated groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This version adds a cymbal at the very beginning and maintains the existing kick pattern.
