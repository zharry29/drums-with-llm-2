Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** no hits
- **Snare (S):** no hits
- **Hi-hat (H):** hits on beat 2 and 4 ("x---" patterns)
- **Toms (T):** no hits
- **Cymbals (C):** no hits
- **Ride (R):** hits on each beat with mixes of open and closed ("x---", "X-x-")

Since the request is to add **not only toms but also ride**, we need to:
1. Keep the current ride hits as they are.
2. Introduce tom hits, probably on one or two specific beats for flavorâ€”common practice is to add them on beat 3 or 4.
3. Possibly add a tom hit on measure 3 beat 3 for a fill-like feel.

### Approach:
- Keep the ride pattern as is.
- Add a tom hit ("--O-") on measure 3 beat 3 for variety.
- Keep other elements unchanged, enhance the groove with the tom.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**
- The **tom** hits on measure 3 beat 3 ("--O-") introduce the tom layer.
- The **ride** pattern remains as before, providing rhythmic consistency.
- The groove now features both ride and toms, as requested.
