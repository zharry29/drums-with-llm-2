**Thought process:**

- To add a cymbal hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `O---` to `O---` (a crash cymbal).
- To add a tom at the very beginning, change the first beat of T from `----` to `O---` (a tom hit).
- For both to sound together at the start, replace T's first beat with `O---` without changing C, which already is `O---`.

**Implementation:**

- T: from `----` to `O---`
- C: remains as `O---`

**Final edited groove:**

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**Result:** The first beat now includes both a cymbal hit and a tom hit, as requested.
