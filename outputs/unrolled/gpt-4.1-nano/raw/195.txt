Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 ("OOO-"), 2 ("--O-"), 3 ("OOO-"), 4 ("OOO").
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("O---") and beat 4 ("O---").
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on beat 1, 2, 3, 4, each with "O---".
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### Goal:
Add **tom** and **more prominent snare** (or reinforce existing snares).

---

### Approach:
- Keep the existing snare hits for rhythm.
- Add **tom** hits to enrich the patternâ€”suggestively on beat 3 or 4, as these are common spots for tom accents.
- To make the groove more lively, we can put a tom hit on beat 3 ("---O") or beat 4.

### Implementation:
- **Add a tom hit** on beat 3, for example: "---O".
- Keep the snare hits as is or reinforce them by adding more hits if needed.

---

### Final editing plan:
- Add tom on beat 3 ("---O").
- Keep snares on beats 2 and 4 to maintain drive.
- Keep the existing kick pattern.

---

### Final groove:

```

**Explanation:**
- Tom hits on beat 3 ("---O") for rhythmic flavor.
- Snares are reinforced on beats 2 and 4 ("O--O" and "O--O").
- Keep other pattern elements for consistency.

This creates a more dynamic pattern with added tom accents and strong snare presence while maintaining the overall groove.
