Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays on the second and last beats with various soft and hard hits.
- Snare (S): plays only on the third beat.
- Hi-hat (H): plays on every eighth note, with alternating open and closed hits.
- Toms (T): only a single hit on third beat.
- Crash cymbal (C): plays on every beat.
- Ride cymbal (R): silent.

**The request is to remove all hi-hat (H) and cymbal sounds (C and R).**

This simplifies the pattern to only kick and snare, with the tom on the third beat.

The groove after removing H, C, R becomes:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-  
S: ----|----|S---|----  
T: ----|----|---O|----  
C: (removed)  
R: (removed)  

**Final plan:**

- Keep the kick pattern as is.
- Keep the snare on the third beat.
- Keep the tom on the third beat for some variation.
- Remove all cymbals and hi-hats.

**Resulting groove:**

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This gives a straightforward, rhythmically interesting pattern with just kick, snare, and a tom accent.
