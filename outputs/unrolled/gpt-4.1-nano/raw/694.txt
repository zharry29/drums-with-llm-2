**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit in the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `O---` to `O---` (already a total of `O---`, so no change needed).
- To add a hi-hat hit in the very beginning, change the first beat of H from `X---` to `x---` (soft closed hi-hat).

**Implementation:**

- K: remains `O---`
- H: from `X---` to `x---`

The rest remains unchanged. The focus is on having a kick and a hi-hat at the start.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This makes sure there's a kick and a hi-hat in the very first beat as requested.
