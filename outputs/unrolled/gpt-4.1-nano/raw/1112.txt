Let's analyze the timing:

- The second beat spans notes 5-8.
- The notation "1 e & a" breaks down as:
  - 1: first note
  - e: second note
  - &: third note
  - a: fourth note
   
- The "a" of beat 2 is the **last sixteenth note (note 8)**.

Now, check the current position of the cymbal (`C`) line:

`C: ----|----|----|----`

- The second clan of beats is characters 6-9 (the four characters following the first '|' and after the second '|').

The four characters represent notes 5-8:

- characters 6-9 = '----'

Thus, the **last character (`a`) of beat 2** corresponds to position 9 in the notation.

To place a cymbal hit on the 'a' note of beat 2:

- Change the 9th character in the line from '-' to 'O'.

H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|--O-|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**Only change:** Position 9 in the `C` line has been changed from '-' to 'O' to add the cymbal hit on the 'a' of beat 2.
