Let's analyze the original groove:

- The second beat spans notes 5 to 8.
- The 'a' of '1 e & a' of the second beat is the last subdivision of beat 2, which corresponds to note 8.

In the notation:
- Each beat has 4 subdivisions.
- Counting the characters from the start (excluding the '|'):
  - Beat 1: notes 1-4
  - Beat 2: notes 5-8
  - Beat 3: notes 9-12
  - Beat 4: notes 13-16

The 'a' of beat 2 is note 8, the last subdivision of the second beat.

### What we need:
- Add a cymbal hit (`O`) **at note 8**, the 'a' of beat 2.

### Find the position:
- The third group's last character (note 8) is the last character of the second beat, second group.

Looking at the line for cymbals (`C`):

`C: ----|----|----|----`
- Character groups:
  - After first '|': notes 1-4
  - After second '|': notes 5-8
  - After third '|': notes 9-12
  - After fourth '|': notes 13-16

So, the grouping:
- First group: positions 1-4 (characters 1-4)
- Second group: positions 5-8 (characters 6-9? Wait, considering total characters and '|', but easier to count directly).

Total characters per line (excluding '|'):
`----|----|----|----`: characters:

Group 1: 4 chars (1-4)
Group 2: 4 chars (6-9)
Group 3: 4 chars (11-14)
Group 4: 4 chars (16-19)

Actually, counting directly:

`----|----|----|----`
- Without '|': `--------  --------  --------  --------`
- Each group has 4 chars, so total 16 characters mapping to 16 sixteenths.

Positionally:

`C: ----|----|----|----`
- Positions in string:
  - 1-4: `----` (beat 1)
  - 6-9: `----` (beat 2)
  - 11-14: `----` (beat 3)
  - 16-19: `----` (beat 4)

(Note: spaces don't exist in actual notation, so counting string positions, ignoring '|')

In the actual notation, counting the string excluding '|':
`----|----|----|----`
Total characters: 16

Mapping to notes:

Characters:
Position: Content
1: '-'
2: '-'
3: '-'
4: '-'
5: '|'
6: '-'
7: '-'
8: '-'
9: '-'
10:'|'
11:'-'
12:'-'
13:'-'
14:'-'
15:'|'
16:'-'
17:'-'
18:'-'
19:'-'
20:'-'

But better to think as:

- Each group separated by '|'.
- The second group (notes 5-8) are characters 6-9 after the first '|'.

From the notation pattern:

- The second beat's last subdivision (note 8) is the last character of the second group.

In the original notation:

`K: O---|O---|----|O---`  
`S: ----|----|O---|----`  
`H: ----|----|----|----`  
`T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`  
`C: ----|----|----|----`  

For the cymbal, in your provided line:

`C: ----|----|----|----`

We just need to change the last character of the second group (note 8) from '-' to 'O'.

That is the 4th character of the second group. The second group (notes 5-8) spans characters 6-9, so the last character of that group is position 9.

So, **alter the 9th character** in the string.

### Final groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|--O-|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

**Only change:** in the `C:` line, position 9 is changed from '-' to 'O' to place a cymbal hit on the 'a' of beat 2.
