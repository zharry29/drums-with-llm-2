Let's analyze the original groove:

- K (Kick): O--O|----|--O-|----
- S (Snare): ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- H (Hi-hat): ----|----|----|----
- T (Toms): ----|----|----|----
- C (Crash): ----|----|----|----
- R (Ride): o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

There's no tom activity in this pattern.

**Objective:**  
Add some tom hits to enhance the groove, especially to fill in empty spaces and add rhythmic interest. 

### Considerations:
- Toms are often played on the 3rd beat for some variation, or as fills connecting words.
- For this rhythm, adding tom hits on the last beat (measure 4) could create a nice fill.
- A simple pattern: place tom strikes on some 16th notes of measure 4 for a fill effect.

### For better flow:
- Place a tom hit on the second 16th note of measure 4 (note 5).
- Optionally, add additional tom hits on the 3rd beat (measure 3), perhaps on the first 16th of that beat for interest (note 9).

### Final plan:
- Add a tom on note 5 (measure 4, second 16th note).
- Add a tom on note 9 (measure 4, first 16th of beat 3).

### Final pattern:
- In measure 4:
  - Add 'T' (or 't') on notes 5 and 9 (for a fill).
- Keep the rest of the pattern intact.

### Code:
- Replace "-" with "t" (or "T") in those positions, or add in a new line if wanted. But since the existing T line is silent, we can incorporate the tom hits directly there.

### Final notation:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|--t-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

Alternatively, since the T line is empty, the simplest approach:

- Replace the '-' at the 5th and 9th position in the T line with 't' or 'T'.

### Final answer:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|--t-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

This adds a tom hit at the end of the phrase in measure 4, creating a small fill and adding rhythmic interest.
