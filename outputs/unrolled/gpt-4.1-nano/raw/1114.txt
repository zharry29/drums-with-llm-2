Let's first identify the timing details:

- The second beat spans notes 5-8.
- The "1 e & a" subdivision is divided as:
  - 1: note 5
  - e: note 6
  - &: note 7
  - a: note 8

The "a" of beat 2 is therefore **note 8**.

Now, find out where this note falls in the notation:

- The entire bar has 16 sixteenth notes.
- The second beat is characters 6-9 (since beat 1 is characters 1-4, beat 2 is characters 6-9).
- The last character of that group, position 9 overall, corresponds to note 8 ('a').

Currently, the `C` (cymbal) line:

`C: ----|----|----|----`

- The second beat's characters are `----` after the second separator.

- The relevant character for note 8 is the 4th character in the second group.

- Since the first group is characters 1-4, second group characters 6-9, note 8 is the 4th character of that group, which is position 9 overall.

**Action:**

- Change the 9th character of `C:` line from `-` to `O`. 

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|--O-|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

Only change: The 9th character of the `C:` line changed from `-` to `O` to add the cymbal hit on the 'a' of beat 2.
