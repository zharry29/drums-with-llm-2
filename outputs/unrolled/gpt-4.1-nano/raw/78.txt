Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits are mainly on beats 1 and 3 with volume variation.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 and 4 in some measures.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent, currently unused.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash cymbal (C):** hits on every beat.
- **Ride (R):** silent, needs to be added.

The task is to add a *ride* cymbal to layer with existing cymbal hits, creating a richer cymbal texture alongside the crash. I will keep the existing pattern and add ride hits, typically on the main beats or off-beats to give groove.

### Approach:
- Maintain the existing cymbal pattern.
- Add ride hits ("O") on beats 1 and 3 for clarity, and optionally add some off-beat ride hits for groove.
- Keep the hi-hat silent unless needed.

### Finalized plan:
- Keep pattern as it is for the main hits.
- Add ride hits ("O") on beat 1 of measures 1 and/or 3.
- Possibly add some ride hits on off-beats, like subdivisions 6 or 14, for more movement.

### Final groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|--O-|O---|--O-

```

**Explanation:**
- I added ride hits ("O") on beat 1 of measure 1 and beat 3 of measure 3 in the "R" line.
- The ride line now complements the crash cymbals, layering cymbals for an enriched sound.
- Keep the existing pattern for continuity and groove integrity.

This should meet the request for both cymbal and ride instrumentation layered together.
