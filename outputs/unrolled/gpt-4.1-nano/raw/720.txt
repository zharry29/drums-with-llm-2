**Thought process:**

- The original groove has no hi-hat or cymbal hit at the start.
- The request is to add a hi-hat hit and a cymbal in the very beginning.
- For the hi-hat (H), I will add a soft closed hit (`x---`) in the first beat (first 16th note).
- For the cymbal (C), I will add a crash cymbal hit (`O---`) in the first beat.
- The rest of the groove remains unchanged.

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: x---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

**Note:** I just realized that the cymbal is labeled as C, so in the first beat, changing it from `----` to `O---` will fulfill the request.  
However, you mentioned adding a cymbal in the very beginning along with hi-hat.  
To explicitly add a cymbal hit, change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---`.  
For the hi-hat, change the first beat of H from `----` to `x---`.

**Summary:**  
I've added a hi-hat hit and a cymbal in the very beginning, fulfilling the request!
