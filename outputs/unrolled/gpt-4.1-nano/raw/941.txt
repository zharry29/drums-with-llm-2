Let's analyze the current groove for the Kick drum (K):

- K: `o---|--o-|o---|--o-`

Breakdown by beats:
- Beat 1: `o---` (soft kick at the start)
- Beat 2: `--o-` (soft kick at the third 16th note)
- Beat 3: `o---` (soft kick at the start)
- Beat 4: `--o-` (soft kick at the third 16th note)

The request is **no kick on beat 4**, so I need to remove any kick hits in beat 4, which currently is `--o-`.

**Change**:
- Remove the kick by replacing `--o-` with `----`.

Final updated groove:

K: o---|--o-|o---|----
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This satisfies the request: no kick on beat 4, all else remains, and the groove is consistent.
