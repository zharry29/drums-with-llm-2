First, let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): soft hits on the first, third, and last beats.
- Snare (S): some hits on the second and third beats.
- Hi-hat (H): plays on every eighth note.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C): silent.
- Ride (R): plays on all beats with a pattern of open/closed hits.

**The request: no hi-hat or kick.**

So, we'll remove lines K and H. Remaining:

S: ----|X---|--X-|----  
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-  

Since the only instrument left is the snare, with some ghost hits and accents, I will keep those, and remove the rest.

Now, we need a simple groove with only snare:

@@@
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
K: (removed)
H: (removed)
@@@

This provides a clear, rhythmic pattern with snare accents on beats 2 and 3, reflecting a straightforward rhythm suitable after removing hi-hat and kick.
