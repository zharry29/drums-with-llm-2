Let's analyze the existing groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits at measures 1 and 3 ("O--O" and "--O-") likely emphasizing stronger beats and off-beats.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 with various articulations (mixed open and closed hits).
- **Hi-hat (H):** currently silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** pattern with alternating open and closed hits, creating a continuous ride pattern.

**Objective:**  
Add a dedicated ride cymbal pattern to complement the existing groove and the hi-hat.

### Approach:
- Keep the current snare, kick, and ride patterns.
- Introduce a ride cymbal hit ("O---") on beat 1, and then on beats 2, 3, and 4 to create a steady ride pattern.
- The hi-hat remains silent because the ride will fulfill the cymbal role.

---

### Final plan:
- Insert "O---" in the R line on beats 1, 2, 3, 4.
- The existing ride pattern with "o-O-" can be kept for texture but shifted to support the new pattern.

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

```

**Summary:**  
- **Ride cymbal ("O---")** added on all four beats.
- **Snare, Kick, and other instruments** kept as previously for rhythmic stability.
- Now, the groove features a consistent ride pattern, enhancing the cymbal support and overall rhythmic drive.
