**Thought process:**
- To add a cymbal hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of C from `----` to `O---` (crash cymbal).
- To add a tom in the very beginning, change the first beat of T from `----` to `O---` (tom hit).
- Both should be played simultaneously in the first beat.

**Implementation:**
- T: from `----` to `O---`
- C: from `----` to `O---`

**Final groove:**

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**Result:** The first beat now has both a cymbal hit and a tom hit, fulfilling the request.
