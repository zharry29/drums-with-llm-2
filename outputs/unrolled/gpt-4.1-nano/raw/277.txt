Let's analyze the given groove:

- No kick or snare hits.
- Hi-hat: ghost notes ("x---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Cymbals (X-x and X-x): hits on beats 2 and 4, with some closed hits.

**Goal:**  
Add a prominent kick and ride cymbal to create a fuller groove.

### Approach:
- Introduce kick drum hits, ideally on beats 1 and/or 3.
- Add ride cymbal hits, typically on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the hi-hat ghost notes for subtle texture.
- Maintain or slightly enhance the cymbal pattern for variation.

---

### Final plan:
- Add kick hits on beats 1 and 3 ("O---" at the start and middle of the bar).
- Add ride cymbal hits (O---) on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep hi-hat ghost notes unchanged.
- Keep the existing cymbals to add rhythm.

### Final edited groove:

**Summary:**  
- Kick drum on beats 1 and 3.  
- Ride cymbal on beats 2 and 4 ("O---" at those positions).  
- Hi-hat ghost notes remain.  
- Overall fuller rhythm with both kick and ride cymbal support.
