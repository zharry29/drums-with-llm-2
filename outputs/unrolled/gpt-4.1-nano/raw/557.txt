Let's analyze what to keep and what to remove:

- Remove the snare (S) and toms (T) lines entirely.
- The remaining instruments are kick (K), hi-hat (H), cymbal (C), and ride (R).

Check the pattern:
- S line: `----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o` (remove)
- T line: `----|----|----|----` (remove)

Remaining:
- K: `O--O|----|--O-|----`
- H: `X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-`
- C: `----|----|----|----` (silent, can omit)
- R: `----|----|----|----` (silent, can omit)

Since C and R are silent, remove them altogether for simplicity.

Final pattern:
- Keep K and H

Now, assemble the final groove:

@@@
K: O--O|----|--O-|----
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
@@@

This pattern excludes snare and toms, keeping only the kick and hi-hat as requested.
