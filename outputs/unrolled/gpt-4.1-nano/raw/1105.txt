Let's analyze the current groove:

- The kick (`K`) emphasizes certain beats with hard hits (`O`).
- The snare (`S`) has some ghost hits (`o`) and accented hits (`O`), contributing to the mid-range but with minimal low-frequency foundation.
- The hi-hat (`H`) is silent.
- The toms (`T`) are silent.
- The cymbal (`R`) plays with alternating open hits (`O`) and ghost hits (`o`), adding some upper-mid and high frequencies.

### Goal:
Increase focus on **low-frequency sounds** by emphasizing more bass drum (kick) and potentially some toms, while reducing high-frequency cymbal activity.

### Approach:
- Make the kick more prominent, perhaps playing on every beat.
- Introduce or emphasize tom hits for low end.
- Remove cymbal hits to reduce high frequencies.

### Explanation:
- The kick (`K`) now hits on every subdivision, establishing a strong low-frequency pulse.
- Toms (`T`) play on beats 1, 2, and 3 with soft hits (`o`), adding depth.
- The snare and cymbals are silenced to emphasize bass.
- The groove is focused on deep, bass-driven sounds imagining a heavier low-end sound.
