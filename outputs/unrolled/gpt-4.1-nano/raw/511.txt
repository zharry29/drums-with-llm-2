The request is to remove cymbals (C and R) and toms (T).  
- The T line: `----|----|----|----` — remove it.  
- The C line: `----|----|----|----` — remove it.  
- The R line: `----|----|----|----` — remove it.

Remaining instruments:
- K (kick): `O---|----|O---|----` (keep the pattern)
- S (snare): `----|O---|----|O---` (keep the pattern)
- H (hihat): `X---|X---|X---|X---` (keep the pattern)

Since the hi-hat is playing and the kick and snare are active, I will just present the cleaned-up groove as is:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---

This version adheres to the instructions, removing cymbals and toms while preserving a consistent drum pattern.
