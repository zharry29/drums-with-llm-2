**Thought process:**

- To fulfill the request, I need to add a cymbal hit (probably a crash) and a hi-hat in the very first beat.
- The cymbal (C) is currently `----`, so I will change the first beat of C to `O---` to add a crash cymbal hit.
- The hi-hat (H) is currently `----`, so I will change the first beat of H to `x---` (a closed hi-hat hit).
- The other instruments can remain unchanged.

**Implementation:**

- K: keeps as `o---`
- S: remains the same
- H: changed from `----` to `x---`
- T: remains the same
- C: changed from `----` to `O---`
- R: remains the same

---

**Final groove:**

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: x---|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This now includes a cymbal hit and hi-hat at the very beginning, fulfilling the request while maintaining the original groove's essence.
