To add some hi-hat ('H') to the groove, I will:

- Keep the existing hi-hat pattern, which is X-x- for each beat.
- To enhance the rhythmic quality, I might slightly vary the pattern or add additional hi-hat hits on specific notes to create more drive.

One way is to emphasize the hi-hat pattern throughout the bar, for example by making every eighth note have a hi-hat hit, which translates to a pattern like X-x-X-x-.

I'll update the H line to be more consistent and energetic, adding hi-hat hits on every 8th note.

Here's the revised line: X-x-X-x-

Now, maintaining the original pattern in the rest of the groove:

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds a steady hi-hat pulse, improving the groove rhythmically while keeping the original feel.
