Alright, let's analyze the original groove first:

Original groove:
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

The last 8 notes are in the last two segments of each measure:
- Measure 3: O O O -
- Measure 4: O O O

Since each measure has 4 segments of 4 notes (total 16 notes), the last 8 notes are in measures 3 and 4, specifically the third and fourth segments.

In the last segment of measure 4 ("-O--"), to add an open hi-hat on the last 8th note, I need to identify the last note in that measure's 16 notes (which are represented in 4 characters). The last note in measure 4 is in the final 4 characters.

Looking at measure 4:
- Segment 4: O O O (which corresponds to notes 13 to 16)

Actually, let's break the last measure precisely:

Measure 4 is represented as: "-OOO" (the last four characters)
- So, the last note is the 16th note, which is the last character in the measure segment.

Currently, measure 4 is: "O O O" with the last character being 'O'.

To add an open hi-hat on the last 8th note (the 16th note), I can change the last character from '-' or whatever it is to 'O' to represent an open hi-hat.

Now, the last segment of measure 4 is "-OOO", which is almost there, but the 'O' is already in place.

Wait, in the original, measure 4 segment is: "-OOO" (from the line: "OOO-|-OOO" means measure 3 and 4 are both "OOO-"). Let's verify.

Original:
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO

Measure 3: "OOO-"
Measure 4: "-OOO"

Yes, in measure 4, the last segment is "-OOO".

Currently, the last note (16th note) in measure 4 is 'O'. To add an open hi-hat on that note, I need to change the last character to 'O' (which it already is), but to emphasize the open hi-hat, maybe I want to choose a different notation.

Looking at the notation rules for Hi-hat:
- 'O' is a hard open hit
- 'o' is a soft open hit
- 'X'/'x' are closed hits

So, 'O' already indicates an open hi-hat. If I want to emphasize this, I can leave it as 'O'.

Alternatively, if there was a different notation, I can change the last character to 'O'.

In this case, the last measure's last segment is "-OOO" (meaning the last note is 'O').

So, the only change needed is to ensure the last note is marked with 'O' (which it already is).

But perhaps the previous notation was different. Suppose the original last note was '-' or ' '.

In the initial notation, the last character of the last segment is 'O'.

To make our change explicit, let's confirm the notation:

Original last measure (measure 4): "-OOO"

Assuming originally, the notation is "-OOO", which already includes an 'O' on the last note.

In that case, the change is not necessary.

But the user requested explicitly to add an open hi-hat on the last 8th note, i.e., the 16th note.

It looks like the last note is already an 'O'.

If it was not, we would change it to 'O' accordingly.

Therefore, the final groove remains the same, but to be explicit, I will ensure the last note in measure 4 is marked with 'O'.

Final step: just confirming the last segment has 'O' on the last note.

Here's the final groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---

This maintains the original groove and emphasizes the open hi-hat on the last note by ensuring the last note is marked with 'O'.
