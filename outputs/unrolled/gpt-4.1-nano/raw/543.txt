The instructions are to remove all cymbal (C, R) and kick (K) lines.

- Remove the C line: `----|----|----|----` — already silent.
- Remove the K line: `O--O|----|--O-|----`

Remaining instruments:
- S (snare): `----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o`
- H (hihat): `----|----|----|----` (silent, can omit)
- T (toms): `----|----|----|----` (silent)
- R (ride): `o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-` — remove this as well.

Since only snare is left, I'll keep the snare pattern.

Final composition:

S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o

This version removes cymbals and kick, leaving a simple snare pattern, fulfilling the request.
