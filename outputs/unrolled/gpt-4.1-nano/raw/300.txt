Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on various beats, emphasizing downbeats and off-beats.
- **Snare (S):** currently silent; needs to be added.
- **Hi-hat (H):** remains active with ghost notes ("x-x-") pattern, providing overall texture.
- **Toms (T):** only a hit in measure 3 on beat 3.
- **Crash (C):** hits on beats 1 in all measures, adding accents.
- **Ride (R):** currently silent; needs to be added.

**Objective:**  
Add a **snare** pattern (preferably on beats 2 and 4 for a typical backbeat) and incorporate a **ride cymbal** pattern (perhaps on all four beats or with some variation) for building a more full rhythmic support.

---

### Approach:
- Add **snare** hits ("O---" for steady backbeat) on beats 2 and 4 in all measures.
- Add **ride** hits ("O---") on all four beats for a steady ride pattern.
- Keep the hi-hat as is for texture, or optionally add ghost notes or subtle variations for interest.

---

### Final plan:
- **Snare (S):** play on beats 2 and 4 (measure 1: "----", measure 2: "O---", measure 3: "----", measure 4: "O---")
- **Ride (R):** play on every beat ("O---") in each measure.

---

### Final groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

```

**Explanation:**

- **Snare:** hits on beats 2 and 4 to form a prominent backbeat pattern.
- **Ride:** hits on all four beats ("O---" each), providing a steady cymbal pulse.
- **Hi-hat:** ghost notes continue for texture.
- **Kick and crash:** maintained for rhythmic support.
- **Toms:** minimal with only measure 3, beat 3, added for flavor.

This creates a balanced, full rhythmic pattern with both a ride cymbal and snare in place.
