Let's analyze the current groove:

- K (Kick): -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
- S (Snare): ----|----|S---|----
- H (Hi-hat): x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
- T (Toms): ----|----|---O|----
- C (Crash): O---|O---|O---|O---
- R (Ride): ----|----|----|----

**Current situation:**
- No snare hits at all.
- Rides are not present, only crash cymbals.
  
**Objective:**
- Add snare hits to give it a stronger backbeat.
- Add ride cymbal hits to enrich cymbal texture alongside the existing crash.

### Thought process:

1. **Adding snare:**  
   - Place snare hits on beats 2 and 4, which are standard for a backbeat.  
   - For note locations:
     - Measure 1: add 'S' on notes 5-8 (second beat), and 'S' on notes 13-16 (fourth beat).
   
2. **Adding ride:**  
   - To complement the rhythm, add 'R' hits on the first 16th note of beats 1 and 3 (notes 1 and 9).  
   - This provides consistency and groove.

### Construction:

- Snare: 'S' on notes 5-8 and 13-16.
- Ride: 'R' on notes 1 and 9.

### Final pattern:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|--S-|----|--S-
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: R---|----|R---|----

**Explanation:**
- Snare added on beats 2 and 4 (notes 5-8 and 13-16).
- Ride added on note 1 of measure 1 and measure 3 (notes 1 and 9).
- The pattern now has a more defined backbeat with cymbal color.

**This version introduces more rhythmic variety and energy.**
