Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** silent
- **Snare (S):** silent
- **Hi-hat (H):** hits in measure 2 and 4, on subdivisions 2 and 16 ("x---" then "x---")
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Crash cymbal (C):** silent
- **Ride cymbal (R):** hits in measures 1 and 3 with variation ("x---" and "X-x-")

**Objective:**  
Add a tom pattern (T) along with the existing cymbal layers. The original groove has a small cymbal pattern (ride). To make the groove more dynamic, we will add tom hits—possibly in measures 1 and 3—at off-beats or downbeats for rhythmic variation.

**Approach:**
- Insert a tom hit ("O") in measure 1 or 2, perhaps in measure 1 on subdivision 6.
- Add a tom hit in measure 3 on subdivision 14.
- Keep the existing cymbal pattern.
- Maximize rhythmic interplay without overcrowding.

### Final plan:
- In measure 1, add a tom hit ("O") at subdivision 6.
- In measure 3, add a tom hit ("O") at subdivision 14.
- Keep existing cymbal and hi-hat patterns.

### Final edited groove:

K: ----|----|----|----

H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: --O-|----|-----|----O
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

```

**Summary:**
- Added a tom ("O") in measure 1 at the 6th subdivision.
- Added a tom ("O") in measure 4 at the last subdivision.
- Maintains cymbal and hi-hat patterns.
- The groove now has a richer tom and cymbal layering.
