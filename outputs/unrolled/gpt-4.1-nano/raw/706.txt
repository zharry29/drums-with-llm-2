**Thought process:**

- To meet the request, I need to add a cymbal hit and hi-hat in the very first beat.
- The cymbal (likely crash) can be added on the crash cymbal track (C), changing the first beat from `----` to `O---`.
- The hi-hat pattern should include a hi-hat hit on the first beat; since it is currently `----`, change it to `x---` (soft closed hi-hat).
- The other instruments remain unchanged.

---

**Implementation:**

- K: remains `O---`
- S: remains `----|----|O---|----`
- H: change from `----` to `x---`
- T: remains `O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`
- C: change from `----` to `O---`
- R: remains `----|----|----|----`

**Final groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: x---|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This now includes a cymbal hit and a hi-hat hit at the very start of the bar, as requested.
