**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit in the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `o---` to `O---` (hard kick).
- To add a hi-hat in the very beginning, change the first beat of H from `----` to `x---` (closed hi-hat).

**Implementation:**

- K: from `o---` to `O---`
- H: from `----` to `x---`

The other parts remain unchanged for now.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: x---|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

Now, the very first beat includes both a kick and a hi-hat, as requested.
