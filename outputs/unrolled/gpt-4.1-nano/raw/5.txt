Let's analyze the existing groove:

- Kick (K): side hits on notes 1 and 6, soft hits.
- Snare (S): ghost or ghost-like hits on beat 2 (X), and beat 3 (X).
- Hi-hat (H): soft closed hits on notes 2 and 14.
- Toms (T): none.
- Cymbals (C): none.
- Ride (R): multiple hits with some ghost notes, mainly on the first three beats.

Adding some toms can provide variation, fills, and a fuller sound. Since the groove is quite sparse, I can insert tom hits on the last notes of some beats to complement the existing rhythm.

**Ideas for tom placement:**
- Add a soft tom (o) at the last note of beat 2 (note 10 or 11).
- Add a hard tom (O) at the last note of beat 4 (note 15 or 16).

**Final plan:**
- Beat 2: insert soft tom at note 11.
- Beat 4: insert hard tom at note 16.

This adds interest without cluttering the groove.

**Updated notation:**

This modification introduces a soft tom just before the end of beat 2 and a hard tom at the end of beat 4, enriching the groove with subtle fills.
