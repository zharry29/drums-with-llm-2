Let's analyze the current groove:

- K (Kick): `OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO`  
  - Kick in beats 1, 2, 3, and 4.

- S (Snare): `----|O---|----|O---`  
  - Snare on the second and fourth beats.

- H (Hi-hat): `----|----|----|----`  
  - No hi-hat.

- T (Toms): `----|----|----|----`  
  - No toms.

- C (Crash): `O---|O---|O---|O---`  
  - Crash on every beat.

- R (Ride): `----|----|----|----`  
  - No ride.

---

**The instruction is:** Remove ride on beat 4, which currently does not have any ride hit.  
*Actually, from the current groove, beat 4 of the ride (`----`) already has no hit, so no change is needed.*

**But** - the initial groove shows that beat 4 for R is silent, so the groove already matches the requirement: *no ride on beat 4.*

---

### Final Step:
Since the groove already satisfies the request, I will just output it with consistent formatting:


@@@
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**This groove has no ride on beat 4, and everything else is as specified.**
