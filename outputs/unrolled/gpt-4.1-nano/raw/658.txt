**Thought process:**
- To add a snare hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of S from `----` to a snare hit, e.g., `S---`.
- To add a cymbal at the very beginning, change the first beat of C. Since `O---` already indicates a cymbal hit, I will leave it as is or reinforce if necessary.

Since the first beat of C is already a cymbal hit, I will focus on changing the snare.  
I'll set S to `S---` in the first beat to add a snare hit.

**Implementation:**
- S: `S---`
- C: remains `O---`

**Final groove:**

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: S---|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This introduces the snare hit at the beginning while keeping the cymbal as it was.
