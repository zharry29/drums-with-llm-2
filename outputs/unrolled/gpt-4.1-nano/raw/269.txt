Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits with varying intensity, including soft ("o") and hard ("O").
- **Snare (S):** lightly played on beat 3 ("S---" in third measure).
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes ("x-x") pattern across all beats.
- **Toms (T):** only on beat 3 of the third measure ("---O").
- **Cymbal (C):** hits on the first, second, and third measures.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add more structure with both cymbal (possibly ride or crash) and hi-hat, to create a fuller, more supported rhythm.

**Approach:**
1. Add or emphasize cymbal hits such as a ride pattern on beats 2 and 4.
2. Keep or reinforce the hi-hat ghost notes ("x-x") for subtle texture.
3. Possibly add a cymbal hit (e.g., crash) at the start or on the downbeat.

### Implementation:
- Keep the hi-hat ghost notes ("x-x") in each measure.
- Introduce a ride cymbal ("O---") on beats 2 and 4 to support the groove.
- Add a crash cymbal with "O---" on beat 1 for emphasis.

### Final groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: O---|O---|----|----
R: ----|O---|----|O---
@@@
```

**Explanation:**
- Crash cymbal ("O---") on beat 1.
- Ride cymbal ("O---") on beats 2 and 4 in the last two measures.
- Hi-hat ghost notes remain for subtle texture.
- The rest of the pattern stays the same, supporting a fuller rhythm.
