**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O---`, `----`, `O---`, `----`
  - Snare (S): `----`, `O---`, `----`, `O---`
  - Hi-hat (H): `X---`, `X---`, `X---`, `X---`
  - Toms (T): all rests
  - Crash (C): all rests
  - Ride (R): all rests
  
- Request:
  - Add a kick hit and cymbal in the very beginning.
  
- Implementation:
  - Keep the first beat of the kick as is (`O---`).
  - Add a crash cymbal hit at the very first beat, changing the first beat of R from `----` to `X---` to indicate a crash cymbal strike.
  
**Final notation:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: X---|----|----|----

This configuration immediately provides a kick and a cymbal crash at the start, matching the requested edit.
