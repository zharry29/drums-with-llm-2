The original groove contains snare (S) and ride (R) cymbals. The snare is on the second beat, and the ride is on all four beats with alternating open and closed hits.

Since the request is to remove all snare and ride, I will delete the S and R lines.

Remaining:
- K: O--O|----|--O-|----
- H: ----|----|----|----
- T: ----|----|----|----
- C: ----|----|----|----

I will keep the kick drum pattern as is, which provides a foundation, and silence the rest of the set for simplicity.

Final version:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----

This meets the requirement: no snare, no ride, and a straightforward kick pattern.
