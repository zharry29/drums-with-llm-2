Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 ("O---") and beat 3 ("O---")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("O---") and beat 4 ("O---")
- **Hi-hat (H):** hits on every beat with closed hits ("X---")
- **Toms (T):** silent (to be added)
- **Cymbals (C, R):** silent

**Goal:** Add toms to the pattern while maintaining the existing groove.

### Approach:
- Add a tom hit on beat 3 ("--O-") to complement the snare and kick.
- Insert a tom fill on beat 4 ("---O") to add variation.
- Keep the kick pattern intact, perhaps emphasizing it slightly with a softer hit (o) when appropriate if needed.
- Keep snare and hi-hat as they are, as they provide a steady rhythm.

---

### Final plan:
- Add a tom hit ("--O-") on beat 3.
- Add a tom hit ("---O") on beat 4 for fill.
- Slightly modify kick if desired, but keeping it mostly intact.
- Keep snare and hi-hat as they are.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**  
- Toms added on beat 3 ("--O-") and beat 4 ("---O") for fills.  
- Kicks retained as O--- and O--O for variation.  
- Snare and hi-hat patterns unchanged.  
- The groove now has more rhythmic interest with the addition of tom fills!
