Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick:** `----|----|----|----` — no kick hits, so there's no need to remove any notes.
- **Snare:** `----|----|----|----` — no snare hits.
- **Hi-hat:** `----|x---|----|x---` — hi-hat hits only on beats 2 and 4 at the first subdivision.
- **Toms:** `----|----|----|----` — no tom hits.
- **Crash:** `x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-` — crash cymbal on beats 1 and 3 at the first subdivision, with additional crash hits on second and fourth beats.

Since there are only a few notes (hi-hat and crash), and the goal is to make it "less notes," I should further simplify these remaining hits:

- Remove the crash hits for even more minimalism, leaving only one crash hit at the start.
- Keep only one hi-hat hit—say, on beat 2 at the first subdivision for a simple rhythm.
- Remove snare, toms, and the other crashes for maximum reduction.

### Simplified plan:
- **Kick:** No change (none present).
- **Snare:** Remove all hits.
- **Hi-hat:** Keep just one hit, e.g., on beat 2.
- **Crash:** Remove all crash hits.
- **Toms:** Remove all hits.

### Final resulting groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This is a very sparse pattern, with just a single hi-hat note on beat 2, simplifying the rhythm greatly.
