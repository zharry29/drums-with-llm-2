Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): clearly plays on all beats with varying intensity, mostly on the first three notes of each beat, adding rhythmic drive.
- Snare (S): only plays on the 2nd beat and 4th beat with a single hit each, creating some backbeat.
- Hi-hat (H): silent.
- Toms (T): none.
- Cymbals (C): plays on all beats, possibly for accentuation.
- Ride (R): silent.

Since the task is to add some toms, I want to bring more variation and groove interest by placing tom hits at strategic points, ideally complementing the existing pattern.

**Choice of placement:**
- To avoid clutter, add a soft tom (o) on beat 2 or 3, at the end of the beat.
- For an accent, maybe include a hard tom (O) on beat 4, possibly at the last 16th note.

**Planned additions:**
- Beat 2: at note 14, insert soft tom (o).
- Beat 4: at note 16, insert hard tom (O).

This will give a subtle fill and accent, injecting more energy into the groove.

**Final edited drum groove:**

This update adds toms on the last note of beat 2 and beat 4 to enhance the rhythm with added texture.
