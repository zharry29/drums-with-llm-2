Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': plays strong hits on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4 with some variation.
- Snare 'S': plays on beat 2 and 4 with hit 'O'.
- Hi-hat 'H': silent.
- Toms 'T': silent.
- Cymbals 'C': hits on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4 with 'O'.
- Ride 'R': silent.

**Goal:** Add some toms to the groove.

Toms are not currently played. We can add some tom hits on different beats to create variation. Let's choose to add a soft tom 'o' at the end of beat 2 in the first and third measures, and perhaps a hard tom 'O' at the start of beat 3 in the second measure, to create a more dynamic pattern.

Here's the plan:

- In beat 2 (second segment), add a soft tom 'o' near the end.
- In beat 3 (third segment), put a hard tom 'O' at the start.
- Keep other elements as they are.

Now, let's construct the new groove with these toms added:

Final plan:
- First measure: no change.
- Second measure: add a soft tom 'o' at the last note of beat 2 (say, at character position 14).
- Third measure: add a hard tom 'O' at the start of beat 3 (character 9 of the third segment).
- Fourth measure: no change.

This way, we've introduced some tom hits into the groove for added rhythm and variation.
