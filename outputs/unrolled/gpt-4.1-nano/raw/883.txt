Let's analyze the current groove:
- K (Kick): O---|----|O---|----
- S (Snare): ----|O---|----|O---
- H (Hi-hat): X---|X---|X---|X---
- T (Toms): ----|----|----|----
- C (Crash): ----|----|----|----
- R (Ride): ----|----|----|----

The kick drum is currently hitting hard ("O") at the start of measure 1, and again at the start of measure 3. Feathering the kick means reducing the emphasis, so instead of full hits, we'll replace some of these with softer hits ("o") or rests ("---") to create a lighter, more nuanced pattern.

**Approach:**
- Feather the kick at the second beat of each measure by replacing the "O" with a softer "o".
- Keep the initial strong hits at measure 1 and 3 for foundational emphasis but soften the rest.

**Implementation plan:**
- Measure 1: "O---" at beat 1 stays as is (strong start)
- Beat 2 of measure 1: change "---" to "o--" (feather)
- Measure 2: no kick hits, already soft
- Measure 3: "O---" at beat 1 stays (strong)
- Beat 2 of measure 3: change "---" to "o--"

This version feathers the kick drums on the off-beats, providing a lighter feel while maintaining the rhythmic structure.
