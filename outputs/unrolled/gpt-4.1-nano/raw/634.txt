To fulfill the request:

- Keep the kick hit in the first beat (it's currently `O---`, so no change needed there).
- Add a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning: change R from `----` to `O---`.

**Detailed steps:**
- The first beat of the kick is already a hit.
- For the ride cymbal, update R: `----` â†’ `O---` in the first beat.

**Final drum groove:**

This provides a kick and a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning, matching the requested modification.
