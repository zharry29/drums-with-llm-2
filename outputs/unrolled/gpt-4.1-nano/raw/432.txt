Let's analyze the given groove:

- Kick (K): hits on beat 1 (hard) and beat 3 (hard).
- Snare (S): hits on beat 2 and 4, with different articulations.
- Hi-hat (H): plays closed hits on all beats.
- Toms, Cymbals (C), and Ride (R): silent.

**Request:** no kick and no ride.

Therefore, we must remove the K and R lines.

Remaining parts:

- Snare (S): continues with hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat (H): played on every beat with X (hard closed hits).
- T and C are silent.

**Decision:**

- Keep snare pattern: hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep hi-hat pattern: continuous, steady closed hits.
- Remove kick and ride.

### Final new groove:

K: (removed)
S: ----|--O-|----|--O-
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: (removed)
T: ----|----|----|----

This provides a simple, tight rhythm emphasizing the snare on beats 2 and 4, with a steady hi-hat, with no kick or ride, as requested.
