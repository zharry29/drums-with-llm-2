Let's analyze the current groove and implement the change.

**Current groove:**
- K (Kick): O---|----|O---|----
- S (Snare): ----|O---|----|O---
- H (Hi-hat): X---|X---|X---|X---
- T (Toms): ----|----|----|----
- C (Crash): ----|----|----|----
- R (Ride): ----|----|----|----

**Change needed:**
- All snare hits (S) should become sidesticks.

**Snare notation:**
- Currently, snare hits are "O" at measure 2, beat 2 and measure 4, beat 2.

**Sidesticks:**
- X and x represent sidestick hits, with "X" being hard and "x" soft.

**Approach:**
- Replace all "O" that are on snare with sidestick hits, choosing "X" or "x" based on emphasis or consistently "X" for hard hits.

**Implementation:**
- Measure 2, beat 2: Change "O" to "X"
- Measure 4, beat 2: Change "O" to "X"

The rest of the pattern remains unchanged.

This completes the instruction: all previous snare hits are now sidesticks "X".
