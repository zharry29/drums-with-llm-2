Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): hits at beats 1, 2, and 4 with various articulations.
- Snare (S): silent.
- Hi-hat (H): silent.
- Toms (T): alternating soft and hard hits on beats 1-4.
- Cymbals (C): silent.
- Ride (R): silent.

**Request:** no kick and no ride.

This means:
- Remove K and R lines.
- Keep the Toms (T), which have rhythmic hits.
- The Toms pattern already gives movement.

To keep rhythm and interest, I will:

- Keep the Toms pattern as is.
- Remove the K and R lines.

### Final groove:

K: (removed)
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: (removed)

This results in a groove with Toms providing rhythmic texture, no kick or ride, and minimal other instruments.
