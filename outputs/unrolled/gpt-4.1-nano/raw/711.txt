**Thought process:**

- The request is to add a hi-hat hit and a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning.
- The hi-hat is currently `----` in the first beat; I will change it to `x---` to add a hi-hat hit in the first 16th note.
- The ride cymbal is currently not present, so I will add a ride cymbal hit in the first beat by changing the ride line (R) from `x---` to `X---`. This indicates a hard closed hit on the bell (which is how a ride cymbal is played in this notation).

**Implementation:**

- K: remains `o---`
- S: remains `----|X---|--X-|----`
- H: change from `----` to `x---`
- T: remains `----|----|----|----`
- C: remains `----|----|----|----`
- R: change from `x---` to `X---`

**Final groove:**

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: x---|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: X---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This now includes a hi-hat hit and a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
