**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit in the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `O---` to `O---` (already a hit â€” no change needed).
- To add a snare hit in the very beginning, change the first beat of S from `----` to `--O-` (snare on the third 16th note of the beat).

**Implementation:**

- K remains `O---` (no change).
- S: from `----` to `--O-`.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: --O-|----|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This configuration places a snare in the first beat along with the kick, as requested.
