**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `OOO-`, `--O-`, `OOO-`, `-OO-`
  - Snare (S): `----`, `O---`, `----`, `O---`
  - Hi-hat (H): `----`, `----`, `----`, `----`
  - Toms (T): all rests
  - Crash (C): `O---`, `O---`, `O---`, `O---`
  - Ride (R): all rests

- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and a kick at the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - Change the first beat of K from `OOO-` to a kick plus a softer hit if desired, e.g., `O---` to keep it simple and emphasize the kick.
  - The tom hit: change the first beat of T from `----` to `O---` to include a tom hit.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**This adds a tom hit at the very beginning and maintains the kick pattern as requested.**
