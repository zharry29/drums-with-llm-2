Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': hits on beats 1 and 3, with a soft hit on beat 1.
- Snare 'S': hits on beats 2 and 4, with some open hits.
- Hi-hat 'H': plays on every beat with consistent closed hits ('X').
- Toms 'T': no hits.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': no hits.

**Request:** Remove all kick ('K') and toms ('T').

- Since 'T' has no hits, no change there.
- For 'K', replace its line with all dashes to remove any hits.

### Final edited groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This version removes the kick drum entirely, fulfilling the request, while keeping the rest of the pattern intact.
