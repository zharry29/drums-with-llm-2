Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays at various points, including soft and hard hits.
- Snare (S): silent.
- Hi-hat (H): continuous pattern with alternating closed hits, keeps consistent rhythm.
- Toms (T): plays on beat 3 with a hard hit.
- Cymbals (C): plays on every beat with hard hits.
- Ride (R): silent.

**The instruction:** remove all toms and kick.

Steps:

1. Remove lines K and T.
2. Keep snare (S), hi-hat (H), cymbal (C), and ride (R).
3. Since snare and cymbal are silent, only hi-hat remains active for rhythmic pulse.

Result:

- Remove K and T lines.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern.

The final groove will contain only hi-hat for rhythm, as no other percussion is specified.

This provides a steady hi-hat pattern, with all other instruments silent, aligning with the instruction.
