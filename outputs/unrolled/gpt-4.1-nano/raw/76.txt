Let's analyze the given groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays on beat 1 ("-O--"), beat 2 ("OO--"), beat 3 ("---O"), and beat 4 ("-OO-").
- **Snare (S):** very minimal, only appears in beat 3 on beat 1 (S---).
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays steady closed hits ("x-x-").
- **Toms (T):** only on beat 3 in measure 3 ("---O").
- **Crash (C):** hits on every beat ("O---").
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add a ride cymbal pattern, complementing the existing crash cymbal, drums, and hi-hat, to enrich the cymbal layer.

**Approach:**
- Keep the current groove intact.
- Layer in a ride cymbal, typically on beats 1 and 3, and possibly some off-beats for groove.
- Since the crash is on every beat, adding ride hits on some beats will give variety rather than overload.

---

### Final plan:
- Keep the current pattern.
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O") on beat 1 and beat 3 ("O" on the first and third measures), and possibly some off-beats for movement.
- Maintain the steady hi-hat.

---

### Final groove:

K: O-O-|OO--|O--O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|--O-|O---|--O-

```

**Explanation:**
- Ride ("O") added on beat 1 and beat 3 (measure 1 and 3).
- The existing crash continues, reinforcing the measure's downbeat.
- The ride layering adds a brighter cymbal texture alongside the crash.
- The groove is now more dynamic with layered cymbals and a consistent hi-hat.
