Let's analyze the current groove:

- The snare (`S`) hits on beats 2 and 4, with some ghost notes (`o`) and accented hits (`O`).
- The kick (`K`) hits on beats 1 and 3 with some softer hits (`--`).
- The hi-hat (`H`) plays in a steady pattern with some accents (`X`) and closed hits, providing a consistent groove.
- Toms, cymbals, and ride are silent, providing room for enhancement.

**Goal:**  
Make the snare more dynamic and lively while preserving its placement on beats 2 and 4. Add more movement to the overall pattern to enhance energy.

### Approach:
- Add ghost notes (`o`) just before the main snare hits for a push.
- Introduce some open hi-hat hits (`O`) or accents (`X`) on off-beats or in between to brighten up the pattern.
- Slightly vary the kick with softer hits (`o`) for texture.
- Incorporate subtle cymbal or ride hits if desired, but primarily focus on percussion for now.
