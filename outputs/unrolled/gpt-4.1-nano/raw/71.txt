Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits in all four beats, with a pattern of hard hits.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 of the second measure and beat 4 of the fourth measure.
- **Hi-hat (H):** currently silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** plays on every beat.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add both a *hi-hat* and a *ride* cymbal to create a layered cymbal texture, ensuring the groove is lively and full.

---

### Approach:
- Keep existing kick, snare, and crash patterns.
- Add *hi-hat* hits ("x") on every subdivision for a steady pattern, complementing the ride.
- Introduce *ride* hits ("O") on downbeats and some off-beats to create groove.

---

### Final plan:
- Hi-hat: "x" on every subdivision.
- Ride: "O" on the downbeats of beats 1 and 3; and on subdivisions 6 and 14 to add groove.
- Keep existing elements.

### Final groove:

C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: O---|--O-|O---|--O-

```

**Summary:**  
- Hi-hat ("x") layered on every subdivision.
- Ride ("O") hits on beats 1 and 3, plus off-beats at subdivisions 6 and 14.
- Maintaining rhythmic balance with existing kick, snare, and crash.

This creates a vibrant, full percussion pattern with both cymbals layered effectively.
