Let's break down the task:

- **Play closed hi-hat** (`X` for hard, `x` for soft) on **all 8th notes** (notes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16).
- **Open hi-hat** (`O`) on **every up beat** (the off-beats just after the down-beats)—specifically notes 2, 6, 10, 14.
- Keep **hits hard** (use `X` for the hi-hat).

### Observations:
- The 8th notes in a bar are at positions: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16.
- Up beats (off-beats) are notes 2, 6, 10, 14.
- Down beats are notes 1, 5, 9, 13 — but since the pattern has no hi-hat notes on downbeats in the original, no change needed there.

### Constructing the hi-hat line:
- On every 8th note (the positions above), use `X`.
- On **up beats**: instead of `X`, use `O` (open hi-hat).
- The remaining 8th notes (4, 8, 12, 16) - if not an up beat, should be `X` (loud closed).

### Pattern:
- 2: open `O`
- 4: closed `X`
- 6: open `O`
- 8: closed `X`
- 10: open `O`
- 12: closed `X`
- 14: open `O`
- 16: closed `X`

### Final hi-hat line:
`-X--|-O--|-X--|-O--`

### Final drum groove:

H: -X--|-O--|-X--|-O--
T: ----|----|----|----

This pattern ensures a consistent, loud, and dynamic hi-hat playing with open hits on every up beat, matching the request.
