The task is to remove all ride cymbal (R) and toms (T).  
- The T line is: `----|----|----|----` — remove it entirely.  
- The R line is: `x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-` — remove it as well.

Remaining instruments:
- Kick (K): `o---|--o-|o---|--o-`
- Snare (S): `----|X---|--X-|----`
- Hi-hat (H): `----|x---|----|x---`
- Cymbals (C): `----|----|----|----` — all silence, so can be omitted or set to silent.

Since only the kick, snare, and hi-hat remain, I will keep their pattern. The pattern already has some subtle accents with the snare and kick, and hi-hat maintaining rhythm. No need for cymbals unless desired for a crash.

Here's the cleaned-up version:

@@@
K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
C: (omit or leave silent)

This version respects the removal of ride and tom, maintains a rhythmic pattern, and is ready to use.
