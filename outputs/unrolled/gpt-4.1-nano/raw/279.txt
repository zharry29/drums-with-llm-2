Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** soft hits on beats 1, 3, and 4.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 3 with a mix of sidestick and open hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes with "x" on beats 2 and 4.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** hits with multiple bell and bow hits, but currently only in the first and third parts.

### Objective:
Add a **ride cymbal** pattern along with the existing snare hits and enhance the groove.

### Approach:
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4 to complement the snare.
- Keep the kick pattern but perhaps reinforce it for groove consistency.
- Maintain the snare pattern.
- Keep unobtrusive hi-hat ghost notes.

---

### Final plan:
- Add ride cymbal hits ("O---") on beats 2 and 4.
- Preserve existing snare hits.
- Slightly adjust kick for better balance if needed.

### Final groove:

**Notes:**
- Ride cymbal "O---" added on beats 2 and 4.
- Kick drum remains consistent.
- Snare and hi-hat ghost notes preserved.
- This creates a more complete rhythm with both snare and ride, filling out the groove nicely.
