Let's analyze the existing groove:

- Kick (K): no hits at all.
- Snare (S): no hits.
- Hi-hat (H): hits on the 2nd and 4th beats, both at the first note of those beats (x---), meaning closed hi-hat on the first sixteenth note of beats 2 and 4.
- Toms (T): none.
- Cymbals (R): plays slight variations with X-x- pattern on beats 1 and 3, probably for subtle accents or ghost notes.

Since there's no tom indicated yet, and the request is to add some toms, I can insert tom hits for variation, especially on beats where we already have some activity, like beats 2 and 4.

Possible ideas:
- Add a soft tom hit (o) on beat 2 at the last note (note 8) for a quick fill.
- Add a hard tom hit (O) on beat 3 at the first or last note for some accents, perhaps at note 12 or 16.

I will choose:
- On beat 2: last note (note 8) with a soft tom (o).
- On beat 4: last note (note 16) with a hard tom (O).

Now, updating T line:
- For beat 2: ---|---o
- For beat 4: ---|---O

Final T line: ----|---o|----|---O

Here's the complete new groove with added toms:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|---o|----|---O
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This introduces tom hits on the second beat (soft) and fourth beat (hard), adding rhythmic interest and depth.
