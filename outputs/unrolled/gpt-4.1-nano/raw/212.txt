Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 ("O---" | "O---" | "----" | "O---"), emphasizing those downbeats.
- **Snare (S):** silent throughout.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** pattern of "O-o-" repeated on each beat, with soft and hard hits.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add a cymbal to this groove along with the hi-hat, to enhance rhythm and dynamics.

### Considerations:
- The groove already has a strong kick pattern and a percussive tom pattern.
- It would be good to add a cymbal crash or ride pattern for fullness, especially on stronger beats.
- The hi-hat pattern ("-x--") in the current setup is absent, so we will introduce it.

### Approach:
- Introduce a steady hi-hat ("x---") on every beat for subdivision.
- Add a crash cymbal ("O---") on beat 1 for a strong start.
- Add a ride cymbal ("x---") on beat 3 for variety and lift.
- Keep the existing kick and tom patterns.

---

### Final plan:
- Hi-hat: "x---" on all beats.
- Crash cymbal ("O---") on beat 1.
- Ride cymbal ("x---") on beat 3.

### Final edited groove:

K: O---|O---|----|O---

**Summary:**
- Crash cymbal at start for impact.
- Ride cymbal introduced on beat 3.
- Constant hi-hat pattern for subdivision.
- Keeps the groove lively and augmented with cymbal sounds.
