**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O---|---o|O-O-|----` (kicks on first, second beats with soft kick on second beat's last 16th)
  - Snare (S): `----|O---|----|O---` (snare on beats 2 and 4)
  - Hi-hat (H): `--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-` (hi-hat hits on every 16th note)
  - Toms (T): all silent
  - Crash (C): `O---|----|----|----` (crash on first beat)
  - Ride (R): all silent

- Request:
  - Add a ride hit and cymbal in the very beginning.

- To achieve this:
  - Add a ride hit: `O` on R line in the first beat.
  - Add a cymbal hit: `O` on C line in the first beat.

**Final version:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

This includes:
- A ride hit (`O`) in the first beat on the R line.
- A cymbal crash (`O`) in the first beat on the C line.

The pattern now meets the requirement for a ride hit and cymbal at the very start.
