Let's analyze the current groove to confirm the hi-hat on beat 4:

- The hi-hat line is: `--o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`
- Break down each segment:
  - Beat 1: `--o-` — hi-hat hits at position 3 (the 3rd sixteenth note).
  - Beat 2: `O-o-` — hi-hat hits at positions 1 and 3.
  - Beat 3: `O-o-` — hi-hat hits at positions 1 and 3.
  - Beat 4: `O-o-` — hi-hat hits at positions 1 and 3.

**Note:** The hi-hat hits occur only on the 1st and 3rd sixteenth notes of each beat, **not** on the 2nd or 4th sixteenths.

**Therefore,** the hi-hat isn't played on beat 4 at all, so it already satisfies the condition of no hi-hat on beat 4.

### Final step:
 reproduce the original groove as-is, since it already meets the criteria.
