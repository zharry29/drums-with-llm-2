The instruction is to remove all cymbal (C, R) and kick (K) lines.

- Remove the C line: `----|----|----|----` (already silent)
- Remove the K line: `o---|--o-|o---|--o-`

Remaining instruments:
- S (snare): `----|X---|--X-|----`
- H (hihat): `----|x---|----|x---`
- T (toms): `----|----|----|----`

With the cymbals and kick removed, the remaining lines are the snare and hi-hat. This provides a rhythmic pattern primarily with snare and hi-hat.

**Final adjustment:**  
Since the snare and hi-hat are both active, I'll keep both and maintain a simple groove.

**Final groove:**

S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---

This adheres to the request: no cymbals or kick, only snare and hi-hat.
