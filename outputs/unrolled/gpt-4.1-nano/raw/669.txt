**Thought process:**

- To add a ride hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of R from `o-O-` to `O-O-` (adding a ride hit on the bell).
- To add a kick at the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `O--O` to `O--O` (already a kick). No change needed beyond confirming itâ€™s there.
- To emphasize the kick and ride, I will ensure both are present in the first beat.

**Implementation:**

- K: `O--O` (already present)
- R: change in first beat from `o-O-` to `O-O-`

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

This version includes a kick and a ride hit in the very beginning, meeting your request.
