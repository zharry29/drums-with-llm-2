Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): no hits.
- Snare (S): no hits.
- Hi-hat (H): hits on beat 2 and 4 with x (soft closed hi-hat).
- Toms (T): no hits.
- Cymbals (C): no hits.
- Ride (R): played on all four beats with various open and closed hits.

**Request:** no cymbal or snare.

This means:

- Remove the snare (S) and cymbal (C) lines completely.
- Keep the kick (K) pattern, which currently has no hits, so no change there.
- Keep the hi-hat (H) pattern to maintain rhythm.
- Remove R (ride cymbal), since it is a cymbal.

### Final plan:
- Keep the hi-hat pattern from H.
- Kick remains with no hits.
- Remove snare, cymbals, and ride.

### Final groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: (removed)
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This is a simple, steady rhythm with just hi-hat for texture and a silent kick, fulfilling the request to exclude snare and cymbal.
