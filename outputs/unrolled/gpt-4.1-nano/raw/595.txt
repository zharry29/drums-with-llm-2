To incorporate a tom hit and a snare hit at the very beginning, I will focus on the first beat (the first four characters of each line).

Currently, the first beat is:
- K: -O--
- S: ----
- H: x-x-
- T: ----
- C: O---
- R: ----

Since the instruction is to add a tom hit and a snare in the very beginning, I will:
- Place a snare hit (S) at the start, for example, O---.
- Add a tom hit (T), for example, O---.

I need to incorporate the snare and tom hits into the first four characters of the first beat, for example:
- S: O---
- T: O---

And since the rest of the groove should stay the same, I will keep other hits as they are.

So, updating the groove starting with:
- K: -O--
- S: O---
- H: x-x-
- T: O---
- C: O---
- R: ----

Here's the final edited groove in the notation:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: O---|----|----|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: O---|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This configuration adds a snare and tom hit at the very start, as requested, while keeping the existing rhythm intact.
