Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on measure 1 and 3 (O--O and --O-).
- **Snare (S):** present on measure 2 beats 2 and 4 ("Oo-o" and "O--o").
- **Hi-hat (H):** steady pattern with alternating closed ("X-x-").
- **Toms, Cymbals, Ride:** silent.

**New requirement:**  
- Keep **snare** in the groove.  
- The groove already has some snare hits, but perhaps we want to reinforce or add more snare hits for rhythm.

---

### Approach:
- Keep the existing snare hits.
- Add or emphasize the snare pattern on beat 3 of measure 4 for variety.
- Maintain hi-hat pattern steady or introduce slight variation if desired.

---

### Implementation:
- Slightly modify the snare pattern to include a snare hit in measure 4, beat 3 ("--O-") for more rhythm.
- Keep high hat as is for continuity.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**  
- The snare remains active, with a new hit added in measure 4, beat 3 ("--O-").  
- The hi-hat pattern remains steady, supporting the groove.  
- Overall, the pattern now maintains its rhythm with reinforced snare emphasis, fulfilling the request for both snare and hi-hat in the groove.
