To fill the entire bar with double kick, I will replace the K line with a pattern that has a kick on every 16th note, using `O` for consistency and energy. The rest of the instruments are unaffected unless required, but typically, for a full bar of double kick, the focus is on the K line.

**Original K line:**
`O--O|----|--O-|----`

**Modified K line with double kicks on every 16th note:**
`OOOO|OOOO|OOOO|OOOO`

Since the request is specifically to fill **the whole bar with double kick**, I will update only the K line accordingly.

### Final new groove:

K: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

```

This creates a bar where every 16th note has a kick, fulfilling the request for a full double kick pattern.
