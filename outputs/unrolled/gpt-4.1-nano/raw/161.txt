Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on measures 1 ("O--O") and 3 ("--O-"), providing some rhythm, especially for the downbeats.
- **Snare (S):** hits on measures 2 and 4, with a combination of open and closed hits ("Oo-o" and "O--o") on beats 2 and 4 respectively.
- **Hi-hat (H):** steady X-x pattern in all four measures, giving consistent eighth-note articulation.
- **Toms (T), Cymbal (C), Ride (R):** silent.

### Goal:
- Add a consistent kick pattern, in addition to existing kicks, to bolster rhythm.
- Keep the cymbal/ride pattern for sustain.
- Maintain the existing snare pattern and hi-hat.

### Approach:
- Keep the kick on beats 1 and 3 ("O--O").
- Add additional soft kicks ("o--") on beats 2 and 4 for more drive.
- Keep the cymbal and snare as they are.

---

### Final plan:
- In measure 2, add a soft kick on beat 2 ("o---").
- In measure 4, add a soft kick on beat 4 ("--o-").

### Final groove:

K: O--O| o--o| --O-| --o-
S: ----| Oo-o| -o--| O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This pattern blends the existing groove with a fuller, more supportive kick frame, enhancing rhythm and groove flow.
