**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O--O | ---- | --O- | ----`
  - Snare (S): `---- | Oo-o | -o-- | O--o`
  - Hi-hat (H): `---- | ---- | ---- | ----`
  - Toms (T): `---- | ---- | ---- | ----`
  - Crash (C): `---- | ---- | ---- | ----`
  - Ride (R): `o-O- | o-O- | o-O- | o-O-`

- Request:
  - Add a kick hit and a tom in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - For the first beat:
    - Change kick: from `O--O` to `O--O` (already has a hit, but it's fine to confirm). To make it more distinct, you could change the first kick to `O---` or keep as `O--O`.
    - Add a tom hit: change T in the first beat from `----` to `-O--`.
    - The kick hit is already present in the first beat, so we just need to add a tom.

**This includes a tom hit and a kick in the very beginning, fulfilling the request.**
