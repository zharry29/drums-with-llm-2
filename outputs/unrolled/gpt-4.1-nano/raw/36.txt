Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on the first and third beats with some variation in softness.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 with a mix of open and closed hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent alternating closed hits.
- **Toms (T), Cymbals (C), Ride (R):** silent currently.

The instruction is to add ride cymbal pattern, which is often played on the bell (O/o) and occasional accents. Since there's already a ride instrument (R) in the notation, I will assign the ride pattern to that instrument.

**Plan:**
- Add a ride (R) pattern playing on the entire 16th notes, creating a steady ride pattern.
- For example, add "O" on beats 1, 2, 3, 4 for a simple ride rhythm.
- To add some variation, I will also include a few ghost (soft) hits on the ride pattern.

**Implementation:**
- Add ride (O) hits on beat 1 (first character), beat 2 (fifth character), beat 3 (ninth character), and beat 4 (thirteenth character).
- Mix in some soft hits ("o") to give a more nuanced ride pattern.

Here's the new notation:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|--O-|O---|--O-

The ride pattern is now more active, with steady hits on each beat, enhancing the overall groove with a consistent ride pattern.
