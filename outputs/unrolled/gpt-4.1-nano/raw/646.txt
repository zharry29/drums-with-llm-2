**Thought process:**

- To add a ride hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of R from `----` to `O---`.
- To add a tom hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of T from `----` to `O---`.

**Implementation:**

- R: `O---` (ride hit)
- T: `O---` (tom hit)

Rest of the pattern remains unchanged.

---

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: O---|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

This configuration adds both the ride and tom hits at the very start, as requested.
