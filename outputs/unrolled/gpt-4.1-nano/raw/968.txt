Let's review the current groove:

- **K (Kick):** `O---|O---|----|O---` — kick hits on beats 1, 2, and 4.
- **S (Snare):** `----|----|O---|----` — snare on beat 3.
- **H (Hi-hat):** `----|----|----|----` — no hi-hat hits.
- **T (Toms):** `O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-` — tom hits on all four beats, with mixed articulation.
- **C (Crash):** `----|----|----|----` — none.
- **R (Ride):** `----|----|----|----` — none.

**Request:** No tom on beat 4.

- The T line contains hits on all beats, including beat 4, with pattern `O-o-` repeated.  

**Solution approach:**

- To remove toms from beat 4, we need to eliminate tom hits on the fourth beat.

- Currently, the tom pattern is the same for each beat: `O-o-`.

- The third beat has the tom hits at first and third position (`O` and `O`), and last and second doesn't matter for this specific beat's articulation.

- To remove tom hits from beat 4, replace the pattern in the last segment with something that has no tom hits.

**Implementation:**

- Change the last beat's `O-o-` to `----`, removing any tom hits on beat 4.

- The other beats stay unchanged.
