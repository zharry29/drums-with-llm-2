To include a tom hit and a snare in the very beginning, I need to modify the first beat (the first four characters of each line).

Currently, the first beat is:
- K: OOO-
- S: ----
- H: ----
- T: ----
- C: O---
- R: ----

For the snare, I will add a hit at the start, e.g., S: O---
  
For the tom, I will add a hit, e.g., T: O---

I will replace the initial parts with these, while keeping the rest of the pattern the same. 

Here's the updated pattern:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: O---|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds a snare and a tom hit at the very start, meeting your request.
