Let's analyze the current groove:

- The second beat line is **Oo-o**, which corresponds to notes 5-8.
- Currently, snare (S) has **Oo-o** there, meaning:
  - Note 6: o (soft open hit)
  - Note 7: - (no hit)
  - Note 8: o (soft open hit)

**Goal:** Place snare hits on **every 16th note in the second beat** â€” notes 5, 6, 7, and 8.

So, I will replace the second beat's snare pattern with **OOOO** to hit all four notes in beat 2.

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: OOOO|----|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

Now, snare is on every 16th note in the second beat, fulfilling the request.
