Let's analyze the original groove:

- The snare hits on beat 2 (`----|O---|`) and beat 4 (`----|O---`), each on the downbeat of those beats.
- The request is to **delay the first snare backbeat by an eighth note**, which means shifting it one 16th note later within the beat.
- The second snare hit on beat 4 remains unchanged.

### Approach:
- The first snare hit on beat 2 is currently on the downbeat. Moving it later by an eighth note (a 16th note in the context of this pattern) means shifting it from the first half of beat 2 to the second half (from 1st 4 characters to the latter 4 characters of the beat).
- For the exact shift, we will replace the `O---` (snare on beat 2 downbeat) with a delayed hit, now appearing at the 2nd 16th note of the beat, i.e., in the second half of beat 2.

### Implementation:
- Original beat 2: `----|O---|` (snare on first note of beat 2)
- After delaying by an 8th note: `----|-O--|` (snare on second note of beat 2)

### Final edited groove:

### Summary:
- The snare hit originally on beat 2's downbeat is now shifted to the second 16th note of beat 2.
- The second snare hit on beat 4 remains on the downbeat.

This achieves the requested delay of the first snare backbeat by one 8th note, giving a slight rhythmic variation.
