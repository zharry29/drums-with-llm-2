**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O--- | ---o | O-O- | ----`
  - Snare (S): `---- | O--- | ---- | O---`
  - Hi-hat (H): `--o- | O-o- | O-o- | O-o-`
  - Toms (T): all rests
  - Crash (C): `O--- | ---- | ---- | ----`
  - Ride (R): all rests

- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and a hi-hat in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - For the first beat:
    - Keep the kick as `O---`.
    - Add a tom hit: change T in first beat from `----` to `-O--`.
    - Ensure the hi-hat has a hit in the first beat; it's already `--o-`, which has a hit on the third subdivision. To make it more prominent, change it to `x---` (a closed hi-hat hit at the very start).

**Final edited groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: -O--|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**This adds a tom hit and a clear hi-hat hit at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.**
