Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 with varying intensity.
- **Snare (S):** plays on beat 3.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** plays on all beats with alternating soft and hard hits.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Request:** no snare or kick. So, remove the S and K lines entirely.

Remaining instruments: **H, T, C, R**.

In the original, only T is active, with a pattern of alternating soft and hard hits on all beats.

To keep the groove lively, I will retain the tom pattern with its oscillating soft and hard hits, and possibly add a steady hi-hat pattern for rhythm. Cymbal and ride are silent, so they are not necessary.

### Final plan:
- Remove S, K, C, R.
- Retain the tom pattern (T).
- Add a steady hi-hat on every beat with closed hits for rhythm.

H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

This provides a lively, balanced pattern with hi-hat and toms, without snare or kick.
