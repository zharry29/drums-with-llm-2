**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `-O--` to `O---` (hard kick).
- To add a snare at the very beginning, change the first beat of S from `----` to `--S-`. Since we're not given a specific snare articulation, I will use `--S-` for a soft snare hit, aligning with the style.
- Keep other parts unchanged.

**Implementation:**

- K: from `-O--` to `O---`
- S: from `----` to `--S-`

**Final groove:**

K: O---|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: --S-|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:** Now the first beat includes both a kick and a snare, as requested.
