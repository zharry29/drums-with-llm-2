Let's analyze the current groove. The notation:

- K (Kick): O--O|----|--O-|----
- S (Snare): ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
- H (Hi-hat): ----|----|----|----
- T (Toms): ----|----|----|----
- C (Crash): ----|----|----|----
- R (Ride): o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

The snare (S) hits are on:
- Measure 2: at the second and third beats ("Oo-o" and "-o--")
- Measure 3: on the second beat ("-o--")
- Measure 4: on the fourth beat ("O--o")

Currently, the only snare hits on beat 2 and 4 are:
- Measure 2: "Oo-o" has snare on beat 2 (second character: 'o'), which is offbeat – so okay.
- Measure 4: "O--o" has snare on beat 4, but let's check precisely.

In measure 4 ("O--o"):
- The first character is the first 16th note (beat 1 downbeat).
- The last character is beat 4, the downbeat of measure 4.

Looking at "O--o" (positions 1-4):
- Note 4 (the last character): 'o' (snare on offbeat).
- So snare is on the offbeat, which is fine.

But in measure 2 ("Oo-o"):
- The beat 2 snare is on the second character: 'o' (offbeat), so it's not on downbeat.

**Summary:**
- There is no snare hit explicitly on beat 2 or beat 4 downbeats (the first note of measure 2 and measure 4). All hits are on offbeats or in offbeat positions.

**However**, if we want to explicitly **avoid having any snare on beats 2 and 4 downbeats** (the first note of measures 2 and 4), currently, it already satisfies that condition.

**But** to make sure, and to possibly avoid accidental hitting on downbeats, we can double-check or adjust by removing any snare on the first notes of measure 2 and 4 if present.

In the current pattern:
- Measure 2: "Oo-o" (characters: 'O','o','-','o') — no snare on the first character (beat 1). Fine.
- Measure 4: "O--o" (characters: 'O','-','-','o') — no snare on beat 1. Fine.

**Conclusion:**
- The current groove already **avoids snare on the downbeat of 2 and 4**.

But for clarity and a clean pattern, I will:

- Keep existing snare pattern as is to respect the instructions.
- Or, if we want to reinforce, I can replace the snare hits on the second and fourth measures with rests on the downbeat.

**Final Approach:**
Since everything is already in accordance, I'll leave the pattern as is --- but with a slight simplification or emphasis that no snare hits are on the downbeats of measures 2 and 4.

This pattern maintains the existing hits and ensures none are explicitly on the downbeats of measures 2 and 4, fulfilling the user's request.
