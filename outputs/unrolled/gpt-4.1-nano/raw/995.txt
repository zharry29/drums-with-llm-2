Let's analyze and plan the change:

- Play **closed hi-hat** on **all 16th notes**: for closed hi-hat, `x` (soft) and `X` (hard) are used.
- Emphasize the **quarter note down beats** — that is, notes at positions 1, 5, 9, 13 — with an accented hit (`X`) to make the downbeats stand out.
  
Current hi-hat pattern:
`X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-`

We need to:
- Fill **all 16th notes** with either `x` or `X`.
- Make **positions 1, 5, 9, 13** `X` for emphasis, aligning with those down beats.
- The other notes can be `x`.

Constructing new hi-hat pattern:
`Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx`

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

This pattern ensures the hi-hat is consistently played on every 16th note, with a strong emphasis on the downbeats for rhythm accentuation.
