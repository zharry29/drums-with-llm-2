Let's analyze the original groove and the task:

- **Current drums:**
  - **K (Kick):** consistent hits on beats 1, 2, 3, 4.
  - **S (Snare):** hits on beat 2 (O---) and beat 4 (O---)
  - **H (Hi-hat):** silent
  - **T (Toms):** silent
  - **C (Cymbal):** hit on beats 1, 2, 3, 4
  - **R (Ride):** silent

The requirement: **Add drum set toms** to the pattern, along with kick.

### Approach:
- Add a tom hit on beat 3 ("-O--") for variation.
- Incorporate a kick with some softness ("o---") on beat 2 for some dynamic difference.
- Keep the main pattern of snare on beats 2 and 4.
- Possibly add some tom fills in the last beat for variation.

---

### Thought process:
- Insert tom note on beat 3 ("-O--") for a fill effect.
- Add a soft kick ("o---") on beat 2 instead of a strong one for contrast.
- Keep existing cymbals, which provide continuous texture.
- Maintain snare hits on beats 2 and 4.

### Final groove:

K: --o-|--O-|--O-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|-O--|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

```

**Summary:**
- **Kick:** soft on beat 1 ("--o-") and others for variation
- **Snare:** on beats 2 and 4
- **Tom:** added on beat 3 ("-O--") for a fill
- **Cymbals:** unchanged for texture
- **Hi-hat:** silent

This pattern integrates toms with the kick and maintains rhythmic interest, fulfilling the edit request.
