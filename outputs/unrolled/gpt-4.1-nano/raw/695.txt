**Thought process:**

- To add a kick hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of K from `O--O` to `O---` (a single, strong kick on the first note).
- To add a hi-hat hit at the very beginning, change the first beat of H from `----` to `x---` (soft closed hi-hat on the first note).
- Leave other parts unchanged.

**Implementation:**

- K: from `O--O` to `O---`
- H: from `----` to `x---`

----

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: x---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

Now the very first beat combines a kick and a hi-hat as requested.
