Let's analyze the initial groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beat 1 (hard), beat 2 (soft), and beat 3 (hard), with some variation.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4, with some hits on beat 2.
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays softly on every subdivision, alternates between "o" and "O" (weak and strong open hits).
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** hits on beat 1.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### Goal:
Add a *ride* cymbal layer along with the existing hi-hat.

### Approach:
- Keep the current hi-hat pattern.
- Introduce *ride* hits ("O") on some subdivisions, especially on beats 2 and 4, to layer with the hi-hat.
- The ride can also play on the "and" of beats, i.e., on subdivisions 6 and 14, to create a flowing pattern.

### Final plan:
- Keep the hi-hat as it is.
- Add ride hits on beat 2 and beat 4 ("O") in measures 2 and 4.
- Possibly add some ride hits on off-beats for more energy, for example, on subdivision 6 and 14.

### Final groove:

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: -O--|--O-|--O-|--O-
@@@
```

**Explanation:**

- Ride ("O") now hits on beat 2 ("-O") and beat 4 ("--O") in measures 2 and 4.
- The hi-hat remains active, alternating "o" and "O" on each subdivision.
- This layering adds fullness and dynamic interest to the groove.
