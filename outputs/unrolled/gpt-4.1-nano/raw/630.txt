To fulfill the request:
- Add a kick hit in the very beginning: change K: O--O to a simple O--- (a single kick on the first 16th note), removing the second O to maintain simplicity.
- Add a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning: change R: ---- to R: O---

**Summary of changes:**
- K: change from O--O to O---
- R: change from ---- to O---

The rest of the groove remains unchanged.

**Final groove:**
