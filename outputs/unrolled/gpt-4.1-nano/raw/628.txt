To add a cymbal hit and a kick at the very beginning:

- Currently, the first beat:
  - K: O--- (hard kick)
  - C: ---- (no cymbal hit)

- To fulfill the request, I will change the first beat of C from ---- to O--- (a crash cymbal hit).

- For the kick, it is already present in the first beat (O---), so no change needed.

**Final plan:**
- Keep K: O--- (already a kick)
- Change C: ---- â†’ O---

Here is the updated groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This includes both a cymbal hit and the kick at the very beginning, fulfilling the request.
