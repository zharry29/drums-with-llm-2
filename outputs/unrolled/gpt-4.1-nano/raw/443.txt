Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays mostly on beat 1, with some hits on beat 3 and 4.
- Snare (S): plays on beats 2 and 4 in some measures.
- Hi-hat (H): no hits.
- Toms (T): no hits.
- Cymbals (C): plays on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Ride (R): no hits.

**Request:** no cymbal or snare.

This simplifies the groove to only kick drums with some pattern. So, I will:

- Remove the S and C lines.
- Keep the K line as is.
- Since hi-hat, Toms, and Ride are silent, I can omit them.

### Final plan:

- Keep only the kick pattern as it provides rhythmic foundation.
- The pattern OOO- | --O- | OOO- | -OOO will be maintained.

### Final groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: (removed)
H: (removed)
T: (removed)
C: (removed)
R: (removed)

This results in a straightforward kick-only pattern, fulfilling the request.
