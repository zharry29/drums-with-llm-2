Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1, 2, and 4 ("O---" and "O---" and "O---")
- **Snare (S):** plays on beat 3 ("O---")
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent
- **Toms (T):** plays on all four beats with alternating soft and hard hits ("O-o-", "O-o-", and so on)
- **Cymbals (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** silent

---

### New instructions:
- Remove snare (S) and ride cymbal (R).

### Approach:
- Remove S and R lines.
- Keep the kick pattern.
- The toms pattern provides some rhythm; since the snare and ride are gone, the toms can carry rhythmic weight.
- Hi-hat is silent; adding a steady hi-hat could add groove, but since itâ€™s not specified, I will leave it silent.

---

### Final decision:
- Keep the kick and toms exactly as they are, minus snare and ride.
- No hi-hat added for simplicity.

### Final groove:

This maintains the rhythmic interest created by the kick and toms, with no snare or ride, fulfilling your requirements.
