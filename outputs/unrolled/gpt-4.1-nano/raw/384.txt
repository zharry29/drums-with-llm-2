Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': plays in bar 1 with a soft hit ('o') on beat 1 and beat 3, and in bar 2 with soft hits ('o') on beat 2 and beat 4.
- Snare 'S': hits on beat 2 (X-) and beat 3 (X-), silent elsewhere.
- Hi-hat 'H': plays on beat 2 and 4 with soft hits ('x') on beat 2 and 4.
- Toms 'T': silent.
- Cymbals 'R': hits on beat 1 and 3 with open and closed hits.

**Request:** Remove all kick ('K') and toms ('T').

- Since 'K' and 'T' are currently empty or have hits, replace their lines with all dashes.

### Final groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This removes kick and toms, keeping the rest of the pattern intact for a clean, drum-only groove.
