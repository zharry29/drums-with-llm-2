Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays softly on the 1st and 3rd beats ("o---", "o---") on beats 1 and 3.
- **Snare (S):** plays on beats 2 and 3 with hits ("X---", "--X-"), adding some emphasis.
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays ghost notes ("x---") on beats 2 and 4 for texture.
- **Toms (T), Crash (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** plays on each beat with alternate open and closed hits ("x---", "X-x-").

**Objective:**
- Ensure the pattern has both **ride** and **snare**.
- The snare is already present, but we can enhance or emphasize it.
- The ride is already there, but perhaps we can make it more prominent or balanced.

### Thought process:
- Keep the snare pattern on beats 2 and 3, possibly making it more consistent or adding a hit on beat 4.
- Keep the ride pattern on every beat, which it currently has.
- Maintain the hi-hat ghost notes for texture.

### Final idea:
- Keep the existing snare hits but add a snare hit on beat 4 to intensify the backbeat.
- Retain the ride hits on all beats.
- Keep the ghost hi-hat notes.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**
- The **snare** now hits on beats 2, 3, and 4, making it more active.
- The **ride** plays on all four beats, supporting the rhythm.
- The **hi-hat ghost notes** remain for texture.
- Keeps the dynamics and pattern consistent with adding more emphasis on the backbeat with the snare.

This results in a fuller, more engaging drum pattern with both ride and snare prominent.
