**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O--O`, `----`, `--O-`, `----`
  - Snare (S): `----`, `Oo-o`, `-o--`, `O--o`
  - Hi-hat (H): all rests
  - Toms (T): all rests
  - Crash (C): all rests
  - Ride (R): alternating `o-O-`, `o-O-`, `o-O-`, `o-O-`

- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and a kick hit in the very beginning

- Implementation:
  - Place a tom hit (`O`) at the first subdivision of T
  - Replace the first kick (which is `O--O`) to add an extra kick hit at the very start, changing it to include an `O` at the first subdivision

**Final edited groove:**

K: O---|O--O|----|--O-
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: o-O-|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

**This adds a tom hit at the very beginning and a kick hit also at the start, fulfilling your request.**
