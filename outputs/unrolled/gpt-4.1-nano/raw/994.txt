Let's break down the request:

- Play **closed hi-hat** on **all 16th notes**. The notation for closed hi-hat could be `x` (soft) or `X` (loud/strong). Since we're asked to play **all 16th notes**, we should fill every note with a closed hi-hat.
- **Accent on the quarter note down beats**: these occur on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4, specifically on the first note of each beat (notes 1, 5, 9, 13). To emphasize these, I'll make those notes loud `X`. The other notes in the measure will be `x`.

So for each beat:
- Position 1, 5, 9, 13: `X`
- All other positions: `x`

### Constructed hi-hat line:
`Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx`

---

### Final new groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx
T: ----|----|---O|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

```

This pattern maintains the original elements while making the hi-hat play tightly on all 16th notes with emphasized down beats.
