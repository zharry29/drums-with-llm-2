Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 ("O---"), 2 ("O---"), and 4 ("O---") with some variation.
- **Snare (S):** only on beat 3 ("O---"), no other hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** playing quick ghost notes on beats 1-4 ("O-o-"), giving a lot of movement.
- **Cymbals (C), Ride (R):** silent.

**Goal:**  
Add more snare hits to create a more balanced rhythm, perhaps on beat 2 for a standard backbeat, and complement existing hits.

**Thought process:**

- Keep the kick pattern as is.
- Add a snare on beat 2 ("--O-") for a typical groove.
- Keep the snare on beat 3.
- Possibly add ghost snare notes to keep the groove lively.
- Consider leaving the ghost hi-hat pattern as is to provide constant motion.

```

**Explanation:**
- Snare added on beat 2 ("--O-") and beat 4 ("--O-") for a strong backbeat with a bit of variation.
- Kick remains on beats 1, 2, and 4.
- Ghost hi-hat notes stay consistent for movement.
- The groove now has a richer pattern with more rhythmic balance between kick and snare.
