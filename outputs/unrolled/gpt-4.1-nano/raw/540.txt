The instructions are to remove all cymbal (C, R) and kick (K) lines.

- Remove the C line: `----|----|----|----` (already silent)
- Remove the K line: `O---|O---|----|O---`

Remaining instruments:
- S (snare): `----|----|O---|----`
- H (hihat): `----|----|----|----` (silent, can be omitted)
- T (toms): `O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-`

Since cymbals and kick are to be removed, only snare and toms are left.

**Final groove:**

S: ----|----|O---|----
T: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

This maintains rhythm with snare and toms and meets the requirement to exclude cymbals and kick.
