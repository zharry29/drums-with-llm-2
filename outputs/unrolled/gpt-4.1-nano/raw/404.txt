Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays on the first and third beats with soft hits ('O').
- Snare (S): plays on the second and fourth beats, with some open hits and some O's.
- Hi-hat (H): plays a consistent pattern of closed hits ('X' and 'x') on every 8th note.
- Toms (T): all silent.
- Crash (C): silent.
- Ride (R): silent.

The edit request is to **remove all snare (S) and toms (T)**.

So, we'll delete the S and T lines. The remaining elements are:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----  
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

The pattern is rhythmic with active kick and steady hi-hats. The crash and ride are silent, but for simplicity and groove consistency, we can keep the crash silent as the original.

**Final plan:**

- Keep the kick pattern as is.
- Keep a steady closed hi-hat pattern.
- Leave crash and ride silent to avoid clutter.
- This creates a clean groove suitable for many styles.

This provides a simple, rhythmic, and clean drum pattern without snare or toms.
