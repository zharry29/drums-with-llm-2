Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick 'K': O---|O---|----|O---  
  - Kick hits on measures 1, 2, and 4, at the first beat.
- Snare 'S': ----|----|O---|----  
  - Snare hits only in measure 3.
- Hi-hat 'H': ----|----|----|----  
  - silent.
- Toms 'T': O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-  
  - Toms are active on all measures, alternating soft and hard hits.
- Cymbals 'C' and 'R': none.

---

### Goal:
Introduce a more prominent kick pattern to complement the existing groove, which is very sparse, and possibly add some snare accents for rhythm drive.

### Approach:
- Add additional kick hits to the groove, particularly on measures 2 and 4, to create a driving rhythm.
- Keep the previous kick hits, and place new ones on measure 2, beats 1-2 (notes 1-8), and measure 4, beats 1-2.
- Reinforce snare hits on measure 3 and add a snare hit on measure 4 for rhythm variation.

---

### Final plan:
- Keep original kick hits.
- Add kick hits on measure 2, notes 1-8.
- Add snare hits on measure 3 (original) and measure 4, beat 3 to create rhythmic interest.
- Optional: add hi-hat pattern for a more complete groove.

**Explanation:**
- The kick 'O' is on all beats 1 and 2 across all measures for a solid foundation.
- Snare 'O' on measure 3, beat 1, and measure 4, beat 3, adds rhythmic variation.
- Toms continue their pattern.
- No cymbals in this version to keep it simple but focused on rhythm.

This creates a more energetic, balanced groove with combined kick and snare activity.
