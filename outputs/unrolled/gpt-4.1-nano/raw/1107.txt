Let's analyze the original groove:

- The original pattern is very sparsely played, with only hi-hat (`H`) and cymbals (`R`) active.
- The hi-hat plays on the second and last subdivisions of the second and last beats with closed hits (`x`).
- The cymbal (`R`) alternates closed (`X`) and soft closed (`x`) hits on some subdivisions, adding subtle accents.

### Objective:
Make the groove double time, which means doubling the subdivisionsâ€”each original 16th note becomes a 32nd note pattern, effectively playing twice as fast but maintaining the same overall feel for the groove.

### Approach:
- Double all hits, so every note is played twice as fast.
- Keep the pattern rhythmically consistent, just increased density.
- Slightly increase the activity in hi-hat and cymbals so it sounds more energetic.

### Implementation:
- Every original note position is doubled, adding more hits, especially on hi-hats, with some ghost notes for a more driving feel.
- Sustain the cymbal hits more frequently to enhance energy.

### Final doubled-time groove:

C: --Xx|--Xx|--Xx|--Xx
R: xXx-|xXx-|xXx-|xXx-

```

### Explanation:
- The hi-hat (`H`) now plays continuous semi-open hits (`x`) on every 8th note, creating a driving, energetic feel.
- Cymbals (`C`) hit more often with alternating soft and hard hits (`Xx`), reinforcing the rhythm.
- The cymbal pattern (`R`) is doubled, with consistent accents.
- Kick (`K`) and snare (`S`) remain silent, focusing on the percussive intensity.

This version feels more upbeat and energetic, fitting double time, perfect for a faster section or more intense part of the song.
