Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** soft hits on beats 1 and 3.
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 3 with sidestick and open hits.
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays on beats 2 and 4 with closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbal (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** plays on beats 1, 2, 3, 4 with hits on the bell and bow.

**Requested change:** no snare or kick.

This means removing lines **K** and **S** entirely.

Remaining instruments: **H**, **T**, **C**, **R**.

- Since T and C are silent in the original, and R plays a constant pattern across all beats with accent hits, we could keep R for some rhythmic underpinning or go fully minimal.

- Given the pattern, it makes sense to keep the ride cymbal (R), as it provides rhythm without snare and kick.

### Final step:
- Remove **K** and **S** lines.
- Keep **H**, **C**, **T**, **R**, but since T and C are silent, they can be omitted if not needed.
- To keep the rhythm interesting, use **R** for a steady ride pattern.

### Final groove:

This pattern keeps the ride cymbal playing on every beat with accents, providing rhythmic texture without snare or kick.
