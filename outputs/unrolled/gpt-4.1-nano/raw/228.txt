Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 ("O--O") and 3 ("--O-")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beat 2 ("Oo-o") and beat 4 ("O--o")
- **Hi-hat (H):** consistent ghost note pattern
- **Toms (T):** silent, to be added
- **Cymbals (C) and Ride (R):** silent

**Goal:** Add a tom pattern along with the kick for more rhythmic depth and interest.

### Approach:
- Add a tom hit on beat 3 ("--O-") to match the existing pattern
- Insert a tom fill on beat 4 ("---o") to create variation
- Keep the kick pattern largely unchanged to maintain the groove
- Leave cymbals and ride as they are, focusing on the toms and kick

---

### Implementation:
- Place a tom hit ("-O--") on beat 3
- Place a tom hit ("---o") on beat 4
- Keep snare and hi-hat rhythms constant

---

### Final groove:

**Summary:**
- Added tom hits on beats 3 ("--O-") and 4 ("---o") for fill and variation.
- Maintained the original kick and snare pattern.
- Keep hi-hat pattern for texture.
- The groove now incorporates toms along with the kick, enhancing rhythmic complexity.
