Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays on beat 1 with a hard hit, and on beat 2 with a soft hit, and beat 3 with a hard hit.
- **Snare (S):** plays on beat 2 and 4.
- **Hi-hat (H):** plays on all beats with alternating open and closed hits.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** plays on beat 1.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

**Request:** no snare or kick, so remove **K** and **S** lines.

Remaining instruments: **H, T, C, R**. Since T and R are silent, and C only plays on beat 1, I will:

- Keep the hi-hat for consistent rhythm.
- Incorporate the cymbal for a accent note at the start.
- Maintain the Toms as silent since there's no info to keep.

### Final plan:
- Remove K and S lines.
- Keep **H** with a steady pattern.
- Keep **C**, playing on beat 1 for a starting accent.
- Keep **R** silent for simplicity.

### Final groove:

K: (removed)
S: (removed)
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This pattern maintains a rhythmic feel with the hi-hat and cymbal, with no snare or kick, matching your request.
