Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K': ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  
  - No kick hits.
- Snare 'S': ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  
  - No snare hits.
- Hi-hat 'H': ---- | x--- | ---- | x---  
  - Hi-hat hits on beats 2 and 4 with soft open hits.
- Toms 'T': ---- | ---- | ---- | ----  
  - No toms.
- Cymbals 'C', 'R': 'R' has hits on all beats with open bell and closed hits, but since the request is to remove snare and cymbals, keep only 'R' if needed.

**Request:** Remove all snare and cymbal parts.

### Approach:
- Remove 'S', 'C', and 'R' lines.
- Keep only the 'H' (hi-hat) pattern, as it provides rhythmic support.
- No kick or snare needed for this simplified version.

### Final output:

H: ----|x---|----|x---
@@@

This keeps the hi-hat pattern, removing snare and cymbal, satisfying the request.
