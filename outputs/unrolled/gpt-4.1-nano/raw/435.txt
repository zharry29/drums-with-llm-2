Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays in various patterns, including a hard hit on beat 1, 2, and 4.
- Snare (S): plays on beat 3 in the third measure.
- Hi-hat (H): plays a consistent pattern on every subdivision.
- Toms (T): plays on beat 3 of the third measure.
- Cymbal (C): plays on every beat with hard hits.
- Ride (R): silent.

**Request:** no kick or ride.

This means:

- Remove the K and R lines.
- Keep snare, hi-hat, Toms, and cymbals. But since only snare, hi-hat, and cymbals are active, the others can be omitted for simplicity.
- Focus on the pattern with snare on beat 3, hi-hat on all subdivisions, and cymbals on every beat for rhythm.

**Plan:**

- Snare hits on beat 3 only in measure 3.
- Hi-hat plays steady on every subdivision.
- Cymbals on beats 1, 2, 3, 4 for emphasis.
- Remove K and R.

### Final pattern:

S: ----|----|--S-|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
K: (removed)
R: (removed)
T: (removed)

This creates a simple, effective rhythm emphasizing the snare on beat 3, with constant hi-hat, and cymbals for fullness, fulfilling the request to exclude kick and ride.
