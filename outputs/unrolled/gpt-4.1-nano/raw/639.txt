**Thought process:**

- The goal is to add a ride hit and a tom hit at the very beginning.
- The ride (R) currently has no hits, so add a hit on the first 16th note: change from `----` to `O---`.
- The toms (T) currently have a pattern `O-o-` repeated; to add an emphasis at the start, I will change the first beat (first 4 characters) to a strike, for example, `O---`. 

**Implementation:**

- Change R: `----` => `O---` (ride hit at onset)
- Change T first beat from `O-o-` to `O---` to emphasize the tom at the beginning

**Final plan:**
- R: `O---|----|----|----`
- T: `O---|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-` (change first beat to `O---`)

**Final edited groove:**

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|----|----|----

This begins with a ride hit and a tom hit at the very start, fulfilling the request.
