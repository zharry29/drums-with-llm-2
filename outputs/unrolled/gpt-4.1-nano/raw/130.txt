First, I analyze the existing groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on measures 1 (positions 1 and 3), and measure 3 (position 3).
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 with some variation.
- **Hi-hat (H):** pattern with X-x-, repeated every beat.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

### Goal:
Add **ride cymbal** and **toms**.

**Approach:**
- Add ride hits ("X" or "O") on beats 2 and 4, perhaps on measure 2 beat 4 and measure 4 beat 2.
- Add tom hits for flavor, such as on measure 3 or 4 beat 3 or 4.

### Plan:
- Insert **ride** hits in measure 2 beat 4 and measure 4 beat 4.
- Add **tom** hit on measure 3 beat 4 ("----|----|--O-|----" â†’ put "O" on beat 4).

### Final pattern:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|----|--O-
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|--X-|--X-

```

- Ride cymbals ("X") added on measure 2 beat 4 ("----|----|--X-|") and measure 4 beat 4.
- Tom hit ("--O-") added on measure 4 beat 4.
- The rest remains the same.

This version includes both ride and toms, fulfilling the request while maintaining musical coherence.
