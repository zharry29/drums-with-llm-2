**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): all rests
  - Snare (S): all rests
  - Hi-hat (H): `---- | x--- | ---- | x---`
  - Toms (T): all rests
  - Crash (C): all rests
  - Ride (R): `x--- | X-x- | x--- | X-x-` (mainly open and closed bell hits)

- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and a hi-hat in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - For the first beat:
    - Keep the kick as all rests.
    - Add a tom hit: change T in the first beat from `----` to `-O--`.
    - Ensure hi-hat has a hit at the first beat: change H from `----` to `x---` (which it already is, but we can reinforce it).

**Note:** The hi-hat already has a hit in the first beat, so no change needed there.

**Final groove:**

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: x---|x---|----|x---
T: -O--|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

**This adds the tom hit at the very beginning, keeping the hi-hat already in place, fulfilling the request.**
