**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): silent
  - Snare (S): silent
  - Hi-hat (H): closed on second and fourth subdivisions
  - Toms (T): silent
  - Crash (C): silent
  - Ride (R): mix of soft and hard hits, with some closed hits

- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and a ride in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - Add a tom hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in T.
  - Add a ride hit (`O`) at the first subdivision in R.
