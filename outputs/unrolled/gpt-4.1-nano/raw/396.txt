Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K' plays on beats 1 and 3 with strong hits ('O').
- Snare 'S' plays on beats 2 and 4 with hits ('O').
- Hi-hat 'H' consistently plays on all beats with closed hits ('X').
- Toms 'T' and cymbals 'C' are silent.
- Ride 'R' is silent.

**Request:** No snare ('S') or toms ('T').

- Replace 'S' and 'T' lines with all '-' to silence them.

Remaining lines are 'K', 'H', 'C', and 'R', but 'C' and 'R' are silent, so they stay blank unless we want to add some.

### Final edited groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This version only has the kick 'K' and hi-hat 'H', with snare and toms removed, as requested.
