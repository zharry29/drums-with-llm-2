Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays on beats 1 and 3.
- Snare (S): plays on beats 2 and 4.
- Hi-hat (H): plays on every eighth note with closed hits.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C and R): silent.

**The instruction:** Remove all toms and kick parts, so remove lines K and T.

Remaining:

S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  
C: ----|----|----|----  
R: ----|----|----|----

We need to decide what to do with this snippet. The snare plays on beats 2 and 4, and the hi-hat continues with sixteenth notes.

Since the instruction is to exclude kick and toms, the groove will now focus on the snare and hi-hat pattern.

To keep some rhythmic drive without kick or toms, I will:

- Keep the snare hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern as is for the rhythmic pulse.
- Set other instruments to silence.

**Final groove:**

S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
K: (removed)
T: (removed)

This simplifies to a rhythm with snare accents on beats 2 and 4, with the hi-hat keeping the rhythm.
