The instructions are to remove all Toms (T) and Hi-Hat (H) lines.  
- Remove the T line: `----|----|----|----`  
- Remove the H line: `----|----|----|----`  

Remaining instruments:
- K (kick): `OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO` (keep)
- S (snare): `----|O---|----|O---` (keep)
- C (cymbal): `O---|O---|O---|O---` (keep)
- R (ride): `----|----|----|----` (remove)

Now, I'll keep the kick, snare, and cymbal patterns to maintain rhythm. The cymbal has consistent hits, so I'll retain that.

**Final version:**

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
C: O---|O---|O---|O---

This version removes all toms and hi-hat, focusing on a solid rhythm with kick, snare, and cymbal.
