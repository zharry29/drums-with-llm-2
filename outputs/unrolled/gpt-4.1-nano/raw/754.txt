**Thought process:**

- The current groove:

  - Kick (K): `O---|---o|O-O-|----`
  - Snare (S): `----|O---|----|O---`

- The request:

  - To have a snare hit and a kick in the very first beat (first 4 characters).

- Currently, in the first beat (`O---`), there's a kick (`O`), but no snare (`---`).

- To include a snare, change the first beat of S from `----` to `O---` (a strong snare hit).

**Final notated groove:**

K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
S: O---|O---|----|O---
H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Outcome:**

- The first beat now contains both a kick (`O`) and a snare (`O`), fulfilling the request.
