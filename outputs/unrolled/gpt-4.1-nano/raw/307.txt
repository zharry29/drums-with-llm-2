Let's analyze the current groove:

- K (Kick): -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
- S (Snare): ----|----|S---|----
- H (Hi-hat): x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
- T (Toms): ----|----|---O|----
- C (Crash): O---|O---|O---|O---
- R (Ride): ----|----|----|----

**Current situation:**
- No snare hits; only the snare is absent.
- The cymbal layer has crash cymbals in all measures.
- There is no ride cymbal pattern.

### Objective:
- Add a ride cymbal pattern to complement the crash cymbals.
- Add snare hits for more rhythmic drive and a fuller pattern.

---

### Plan:
- Keep the crash cymbals in measures 1-4, possibly emphasizing the first beat or adding cymbal hits on beat 3 for variation.
- Add ride cymbal hits (R) on notes 1 and 9 (downbeats of measures 1 and 3).
- Introduce snare hits on beat 2 and 4 (notes 5-8 and 13-16) with some ghost echoes to create groove.

---

### Final pattern:
- Snare: add 'S' on notes 5-8 and 13-16.
- Ride: add 'R' at notes 1 and 9.
- Keep existing hi-hats and kick pattern.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**
- Snare hits on beats 2 and 4 for punch.
- Ride cymbal hits on notes 1 and 9 for rhythmic stability.
- The pattern is more energetic and supportive of a full drum kit sound.
