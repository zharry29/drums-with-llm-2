Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1, 2, and 3 with different dynamics.
- **Snare (S):** silent.
- **Hi-hat (H):** steady pattern with ghost notes ("x-x-").
- **Toms (T):** hit on beat 3.
- **Crash cymbal (C):** hits on beats 1, 2, and 3.
- **Ride cymbal (R):** silent.

**Objective:**  
Add a ride cymbal pattern for rhythmic support and replace or add to the crash cymbal hits to include ride sounds, making the drum pattern fuller with both cymbals present.

---

### Approach:
- Introduce a **ride cymbal** pattern: typical for a ride, "O---" on every beat, or some variation.
- To avoid overlapping excessively with crash hits, perhaps keep the crash in some beats and add ride hits on others.
- Reinforce the snare if necessaryâ€”currently silent, but since the instructions specify adding cymbals, mainly focus on cymbal addition.

---

### Final plan:
- Add **"O---"** in **R** on every beat for a clear ride pattern.
- Keep the **C** cymbal on beats 1, 2, and 3.
- Keep the hi-hat ghost notes.
- Keep the kick, perhaps with slight variation if needed.

### Final edited groove:

K: -O--|OO--|---O|-OO-
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: O---|O---|O---|----
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

```

**Summary:**
- Ride cymbal ("O---") now plays on every beat, supporting the rhythm.
- The crash cymbal remains in place on beats 1, 2, and 3.
- Snare pattern is maintained, providing rhythmic emphasis.
- Hi-hat ghost notes texture remains.

This creates a more complete and dynamic percussion pattern with both cymbals and the snare active.
