**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `O--- | ---- | O--- | ----`
  - Snare (S): `---- | O--- | ---- | O---`
  - Hi-hat (H): `X--- | X--- | X--- | X---`
  - Toms (T): all rests
  - Crash (C): all rests
  - Ride (R): all rests

- Request:
  - Add a tom hit and hi-hat in the very beginning.

- Implementation:
  - For the first beat:
    - Keep the kick as `O---`.
    - Add a tom hit: change T (Toms) in the first beat from `----` to `-O--`.
    - The hi-hat is already playing `X---`, which is consistent, but to emphasize the initial strike, keep it as is or slightly adjust if needed. Since `X---` already has a hit at the start, no change is necessary here.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: -O--|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**This adds a tom hit at the beginning and maintains the hi-hat, exactly as requested.**
