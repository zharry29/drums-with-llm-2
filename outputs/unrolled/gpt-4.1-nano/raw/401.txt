Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays on various beats with hard hits (O).
- Snare (S): plays on the second and fourth beats.
- Hi-hat (H): silent.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Crash (C): plays on every 16th note in all four beats, on the first note of each beat.
- Ride (R): silent.

Since the instruction is to remove all snare (S) and toms (T), we will delete these lines entirely and keep the rest. 

The remaining instruments:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO  
H: ----|----|----|----  
C: O---|O---|O---|O---  
R: ----|----|----|----

Now, to keep the rhythm interesting:

- The key driving element is the kick (K), which is already quite active.
- The crash cymbal (C) plays at the beginning and emphasizes each beat.
- Hi-hat (H) is silent, but I can replace it with some closed hats to keep the texture lively if desired.
- The ride cymbal (R) is silent, but could be added for variation.

Assuming we want to keep things straightforward and rhythmic, I will:

- Remove the snare and toms.
- Keep the kick pattern as is.
- Keep the crash cymbal pattern as is, since it establishes strong accents.
- Add a simple closed hi-hat pattern to maintain a steady rhythm.

A possible refined pattern:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO (keep as is)
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x- (adding consistent closed hi-hat hits on every 8th note)
C: O---|O---|O---|O--- (keep crash cymbal on the downbeat of each beat)
R: ----|----|----|---- (keeping ride silent for a cleaner sound)

Final version:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This maintains an energetic motif without snare or toms, adding a consistent hi-hat for groove.
