Let's analyze the original groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 and 3 ("O---" and "O---")
- **Snare (S):** hits on beats 2 and 4 ("O---" and "O---")
- **Hi-hat (H):** hits on every beat with closed hit notes ("X---")
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (C) and Ride (R):** silent

**Goal:** Incorporate toms into this groove for added depth, rhythm, and fill. 

---

### Approach:

- Add a tom hit on beat 2 ("--O-") or beat 3 ("--O-") for variation.
- For more rhythmic interest, place a tom hit on beat 4 ("---O") to act as a fill.
- Keep the kick pattern largely intact but possibly add a softer kick variation if wanted.
- Maintain snare pattern to preserve drive.
- Keep hi-hat pattern as is for consistency.

---

### Implementation:

- Add a tom on beat 2 ("--O-") to add depth.
- Add a tom on beat 4 ("---O") for fill.
- Keep the kick pattern as is, or perhaps make one of the kicks softer (e.g., "o---") if desired, but to keep it consistent, leave it as is.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**

- Added toms on beat 2 ("--O-") and beat 4 ("---O") to create fills.
- Kept the kick, snare, and hi-hat patterns consistent to preserve rhythm.
- The groove now includes toms, adding rhythmic richness and fill potential.
