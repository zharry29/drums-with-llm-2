The instruction is to remove all ride cymbal (R) and tom (T) parts.  
- The T line is: `----|----|----|----`, so remove it entirely.  
- The R line is: `----|----|----|----`, so remove this as well.

Remaining instruments:
- K: O---|---o|O-O-|----
- S: ----|O---|----|O---
- H: --o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
- C: O---|----|----|----

I'll keep the hihat pattern as the rhythmic foundation, since it's present and active.  
The snare on beats 2 and 4, with some accents, adds rhythmic interest.  
The kick provides a steady pulse.

**Final plan:**
- Keep the kick as is.
- Keep the snare pattern.
- Keep the hihat pattern.
- Remove ride and toms.

**Final groove:**

This version meets the requirement by excluding ride cymbal and toms, maintaining a simple, rhythmic, effective pattern.
