**Thought process:**

- Original groove:
  - Kick (K): `OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO` (kicks on first couple of beats and last)
  - Snare (S): `----|O---|----|O---` (snare on beats 2 and 4)
  - Hi-hat (H): `----|----|----|----` (silent)
  - Toms (T): `----|----|----|----` (silent)
  - Crash (C): `O---|O---|O---|O---` (crash on each beat)
  - Ride (R): `----|----|----|----` (silent)

- Request:
  - A snare hit and a tom in the very beginning.

- The first beat currently:
  - Kick: `O` (present)
  - Snare: `----` (none)
  - Tom: `----` (none)
  - Hi-hat: `----`
  - Toms: `----`

- To fulfill the request:
  - Change the first beat snare to a hit, e.g., `X` for a normal snare hit.
  - Add a tom hit: for example, on the first beat, change the T line to include an `O` at the start of the first beat.

**Implementation:**
- First beat snare: from `----` to `X---`
- First beat tom: from `----` to `O---`

**Final groove:**

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: X---|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This now has a snare (X) and a tom (O) in the first beat, as requested.
