To add a tom hit and cymbal at the very beginning, I will modify the first beat (first 4 characters) of each line:

Current first beat:
- K: OOO-
- S: ----
- H: ----
- T: ----
- C: O---
- R: ----

I will:
- Add a tom hit: T: O--- (a hard tom hit at the start)
- Add a cymbal: C: O--- (a crash cymbal in the first beat)

Since the crash cymbal is already present in the first beat, I will keep the crash cymbal as is to fulfill that part of the request, and just add the tom hit.

New first beat:
- K: OOO-
- S: ----
- H: ----
- T: O---
- C: O---
- R: ----

Final groove:

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds the tom hit at the very beginning and retains the cymbal in the first beat as was originally present.
