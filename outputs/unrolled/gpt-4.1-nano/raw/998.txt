To fulfill the request:

- Play **closed hi-hat** (`x`) on **all 16th notes**.
- **Accent the quarter note down beats** (notes 1, 5, 9, 13) with a louder hit (`X`) to emphasize the rhythm.
- Remaining notes will be `x` for consistency and softer sound.

Constructing the hi-hat line:
- Positions 1, 5, 9, 13: `X` (accented hits at downbeats)
- All other positions: `x`

Result:
`Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx|Xxxx`

### Final groove:

This pattern provides a continuous, accented closed hi-hat on all 16th notes, with emphasis on the downbeats for a strong rhythmic pulse.
