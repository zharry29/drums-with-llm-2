**Thought process:**

- To add a ride hit at the very beginning, I need to replace or modify the first beat of the R pattern from `o-O-` to `O---`.
- To add a tom hit at the beginning, in the T part, I should add a hit on the first 16th note. The current pattern is `----`, so changing it to `O---` makes sense.

**Implementation:**

- Change R (ride) first beat from `o-O-` to `O---`.
- Change T (tom) first beat from `----` to `O---`.

**Final groove:**

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: ----|----|----|----
T: O---|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|o-O-|o-O-|o-O-

This provides a strong initial ride hit and a tom hit right at the start, fulfilling the request.
