**Thought process:**

- The original groove has the hi-hat pattern `X---|X---|X---|X---`, with hits on every beat.
- To add a cymbal (probably a crash cymbal) at the very beginning, I will set the first beat of C (cymbal) to `O---` (for a crash hit).
- The hi-hat is already active, so no change needed there.
- This will emphasize the beginning with both a hi-hat and cymbal hit.

**Final groove:**

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: X---|X---|X---|X---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:**  
- The cymbal (C) now has a hit (`O---`) right at the start, matching the request for a cymbal and hi-hat in the very beginning.  
- The hi-hat remains as is.
