Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** soft hits on beats 1 and 3, with some soft hits on the off-beats.
- **Snare (S):** accents on beats 2 and 3 via sidestick hits (X).
- **Hi-hat (H):** closed hits on the off-beats of beats 2 and 4.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Cymbals (C):** silent.
- **Ride (R):** plays alternating open (O) and closed (X) hits, creating some rhythmic activity.

Since there's already a pattern of ride hits in the notation, I will enhance the ride pattern by emphasizing the downbeats with more consistent ride bell hits, while keeping the existing ghost/alternate hits for variation.

### Approach:
- Add prominent "O" (hard bell hit) on the downbeats (positions 1, 5, 9, 13).
- Add some soft "o" in off-beat positions for variation.
- Slightly increase the consistency of ride hits to reinforce the rhythmic pulse.

### Implementation:
- Place "O" on positions 1, 5, 9, 13.
- Add "o" at positions 3, 7, 11, 15 for variation.
- Maintain some existing "X" and "O" to keep the interesting texture.

### Final pattern:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|X---|--X-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

This creates a strong, consistent ride pattern emphasizing the downbeats with some soft hits in between for groove and variation while keeping the overall rhythm lively and balanced.
