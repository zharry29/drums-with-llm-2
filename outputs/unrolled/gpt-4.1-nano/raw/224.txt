Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on each beat with varying intensity.
- **Snare (S):** hits only on beat 2 and 4 ("O---" | "O---"), providing a simple backbeat.
- **Hi-hat (H):** silent.
- **Toms (T):** silent.
- **Crash (C):** hits on all beats ("O---" repeated), adding cymbal coverage.
- **Ride (R):** silent.

The request is to ensure the groove **has not only cymbals but also a more prominent snare** pattern. Currently, the snare is already on beats 2 and 4, which is standard, but to enhance the groove, I could:

- Reinforce or expand the snare pattern, perhaps adding some ghost or softer hits.
- Add or emphasize cymbal hits (like a crash on beat 1 for emphasis, or ride hits).
- Maintain the groove's core rhythm and add more variation for interest.

**Given the existing pattern:**

- S: "----" | "O---" | "----" | "O---" (snare on beats 2 and 4)
- C: "O---" in all beats (constant crash cymbal)

**Implementation plan:**

- Keep the snare hits on beats 2 and 4.
- Add a crash cymbal on beat 1 and perhaps beat 3 for emphasis.
- To diversify, introduce a ride cymbal (x---) on beat 3 for texture.
- Keep the kick pattern as is for a steady foundation.

---

### Final ideas:
- Crash cymbal ("O---") on beat 1
- Snare ("O---") on beats 2 and 4
- Ride cymbal ("x---") on beat 3
- Keep hi-hat silent for now, as per the original, to maintain simplicity

### Final groove:

```plaintext
@@@
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: ----|----|----|----
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: ----|--x-|----|----
@@@
```

**Explanation:**

- Crash cymbal on beat 1 ("O---")
- Snare on beats 2 and 4 ("O---")
- Ride cymbal on beat 3 ("x---") for additional texture
- Kick pattern remains rhythmic
- Hi-hat is silent, matching the original style

This version ensures both cymbal and snare are prominent, adding richness and drive to the groove.
