The instruction is to remove all ride cymbal (R) and hi-hat (H) parts from the groove. 

Looking at the current groove:
- H: plays on all four beats with soft hits, so I will delete this line.
- R: no hits, so we can ignore this line.

Remaining instruments:
- K (kick): plays on the first, second, third, and fourth beats with varying articulation.
- S (snare): plays on beat 2 and 4.
- C (cymbal): plays on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4 with alternating hits.
- T: silent.

Since the request is to remove hi-hat and ride, I will remove the H line completely, and keep the others as they are, which gives a straightforward pattern with kick, snare, and cymbal.

**Final pattern:**

K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
C: O---|O---|O---|O---

This version emphasizes the kick, snare, and crash cymbal without hi-hat or ride.
