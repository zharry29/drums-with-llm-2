Let's analyze the current groove:

- Kick (K): O--O|----|--O-|----
  - Kicks on the 1st and 4th beat, and additionally on the 3rd beat halfway through (on the 3rd note).

- Snare (S): ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
  - Snares on the 2nd beat (notes 5-8), with some variation (soft open, and some ghost notes).
  - An accent on the 4th beat (note 13).

- Hi-hat (H): X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
  - Continuous sixteenth notes on the hi-hat for all four beats with alternating articulations (possibly closed and open).

- Toms (T): ----|----|----|----
  - None currently.

- Cymbals (C): ----|----|----|----
  - None currently.

- Ride (R): ----|----|----|----
  - None currently.

Since the instruction is to add some toms to the groove, I will choose moments where toms can complement the existing patternâ€”perhaps at the end of some beats or to add variation.

I notice there are opportunities on the 3rd and 4th beats where I could insert tom hits.

Suggestions:
- Add a tom hit on the third beat at the last note (note 12), which emphasizes the groove without cluttering.
- Add a tom hit on the 4th beat, perhaps on note 15 or 16, to add interest at the end of the measure.

Here's my plan:
- T: add a hit on beat 3 at note 12 with a soft tom (o).
- T: add a hit on beat 4 at note 15 with a hard tom (O).

Now, let's prepare the beat with these tom hits.

Final notes:
- T line: ----|----|--o-|O---

Here's the full edited groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|--o-|-O--
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This adds some tom hits on the third and fourth beats, creating variation and enhancing the groove with percussion interest.
