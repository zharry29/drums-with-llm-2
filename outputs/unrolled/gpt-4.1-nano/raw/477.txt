Let's look at the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays on first beat and third beat with soft hits.
- Snare (S): plays on beat 2 and 3 with sidesticks.
- Hi-hat (H): plays on beat 2 and 4 with closed hits.
- Toms (T): not played.
- Cymbals (C): not played.
- Ride (R): plays on all beats with alternation of open and closed hits.

**Request:** No kick or hi-hat.

This means removing **K** and **H** lines entirely.

Remaining instruments: **S**, **T**, **C**, **R**.

- **S**: plays on beats 2 and 3 with accents.
- **T**: silent.
- **C**: silent.
- **R**: plays on all beats with open/closed bell hits.

To keep the groove lively, I will:

- Keep **R** for a consistent ride pattern.
- Keep **S** for the accents on 2 and 3.
- Remove **K** and **H** as instructed.

### Final groove:

**This maintains rhythmic interest with ride cymbal and snare accents while removing kick and hi-hat.**
