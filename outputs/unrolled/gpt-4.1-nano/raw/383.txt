Let's carefully analyze the original groove:

- Kick 'K':

  - Bar 1: -O-- (soft hit on beat 2)
  - Bar 2: OO-- (two hits on beats 1 and 2)
  - Bar 3: ---O (hit on beat 4)
  - Bar 4: -OO- (hits on beats 2 and 3)

- Snare 'S': only in bar 3, few hits
- Hi-hat 'H': played on every beat with alternating x-x- pattern
- Toms 'T': only in bar 3, with a hit on beat 3
- Crash 'C': hits at the beginning of each bar, which can stay for a steady rhythmic accent
- Ride 'R': silent

**Request:** Remove all kick ('K') and toms ('T').

- Set 'K' line to all dashes ('-') since no kick hits are wanted.
- Set 'T' line to all dashes.

Remaining lines: 'S', 'H', 'C', 'R'.

Let's write the new groove accordingly:

### Final edited groove:

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|S---|----
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

Explanation:
- Kick and Toms removed.
- Snare remains on beat 3 of bar 3 for a slight backbeat.
- Hi-hat remains with the consistent pattern.
- Crash remains on the downbeat of each bar.
- Ride remains silent as per the modification.

If you'd like to add some ride cymbal hits for more flavor, I could incorporate that. But based on the request, this is a clean removal of kick and toms while keeping the groove intact.
