Let's analyze the existing groove:

- **Kick (K):** hits on beats 1 ("-O--"), 2 ("OO--"), 3 ("-O-"), 4 ("-OO-")
- **Snare (S):** only on beat 3 ("S---") in the third measure
- **Hi-hat (H):** ghost notes, alternating X and x pattern
- **Toms (T):** only on beat 3 ("---O") in third measure
- **Cymbals (C):** hits on beats 1, 2, 3, 4
- **Ride (R):** silent

**New goal:** Incorporate a tom pattern along with the kick. 

### Approach:
- Add a tom hit on beat 2, perhaps right after the kick for punch.
- Also, make space for a fill by placing a tom hit on beat 4.
- Keep the kick pattern mostly intact for continuity.
- Maintain snare and hi-hat as they support the groove.

### Implementation:
- Add a tom hit on beat 2 ("--T-") 
- Add a tom hit on beat 4 ("--T-")
- Ensure kick stays active but with some variation for dynamics.

### Final groove:

**Summary:**
- **Toms:** added on beat 2 ("--T-") and beat 4 ("--T-") for fills.
- **Kick:** maintained with some variation.
- **Snare, hi-hat, cymbals:** unchanged to support rhythm.
- The pattern adds rhythmic interest by including toms on beats 2 and 4, creating a fuller and more dynamic groove.
