Let's analyze the original groove:

- Kick (K): plays on beat 1 with a hard hit, and on beat 2 with a soft hit.
- Snare (S): plays on beat 2 and 4, with a hard hit on beat 2 and a soft hit on beat 4.
- Hi-hat (H): plays a pattern with soft open and closed hits; it alternates over the four beats.
- Toms (T): silent.
- Cymbals (C): plays on beat 1.
- Ride (R): silent.

**Request:** no toms or kick.

This means:

- Remove the T and K lines.
- Keep snare, hi-hat, cymbal, and ride as needed, but given the specific sample, only the snare, hi-hat, and cymbal/ride are worth considering.

In the original, the kick and tom lines are empty or contain no hits, so just remove them.

**Result:**

- Keep the snare and hi-hat lines.
- We can decide to keep the cymbal if desired, but it's silent in the original.

To create a clean, simple pattern focusing on snare and hi-hat (without kick or toms), I will:

- Keep the snare pattern with hits on beat 2 (hard) and beat 4 (soft).
- Keep the hi-hat pattern as is to maintain rhythm.
- Remove the cymbal/ride lines (since the original are silent).
