Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** silent
- **Snare (S):** silent
- **Hi-Hat (H):** plays soft closed hits ("x---" then "x---" on the last beat)
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Crash (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** plays some hits with closed bell hits ("X-x-") pattern, alternating with "x---"

**Goal:**  
Add *both* a cymbal (likely a crash) *and* a ride cymbal to the groove. The current "R" pattern already plays ride hits, but the prompt emphasizes adding a cymbal (typically a crash cymbal).

**Approach:**  
- Keep the existing ride already layered ("X-x-") pattern.
- Add crash cymbal hits ("O---") on strategic downbeats, such as measure 1 and 3.
- Possibly add some crash hits on beat 3 for more impact, and keep the ride pattern for rhythm.

---

### Final plan:
- Keep the existing ride pattern.
- Add crash cymbal hits in the first and third measures.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern.
- Keep the rest of the groove minimal for focus.

### Final groove:

```plaintext

K: ----|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
C: O---|----|O---|----
R: X-x-|x---|X-x-|x---

```

**Explanation:**
- Crash cymbal ("O---") hits on the first beat of measures 1 and 3 to add accents.
- Ride pattern ("X-x-") remains intact for a steady rhythm.
- Hi-hat continues with "x---" pattern for a tight layered feel.
- The groove now has both ride and crash cymbal layers balanced.
