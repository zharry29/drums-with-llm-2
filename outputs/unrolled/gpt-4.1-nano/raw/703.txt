**Thought process:**

- To fulfill the request, I will add a cymbal hit (most naturally on the crash cymbal, C) at the very first beat. Change the first beat of C from `O---` to `O---` (already a crash hit, no change needed). To make it more prominent, I could add an additional crash hit or enhance the existing one.
- To add a hi-hat in the very beginning, change the first beat of H from `----` to `x---` (a soft closed hi-hat).
- Since the current groove has no cymbal hit, I will explicitly add a hit to the first beat of C (leaving it as `O---`) and a hi-hat hit in the first beat.

**Implementation:**

- K stays the same.
- H: from `----` to `x---` (adding a hi-hat hit)
- C: from `O---` to `O---` (already a crash hit, so no change needed)

**Final groove:**

@@@
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@

But as per the request, to emphasize a cymbal hit and hihat at the start, Iâ€™ll add a hi-hat hit in the first beat and ensure the cymbal sound is prominent.

**Revised:**

- Change the first beat of H to `x---` (already done).
- For the cymbal, since `O---` already indicates a crash cymbal on the first beat, it's acceptable.

Final answer:

@@@
K: OOO-|--O-|OOO-|-OOO
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|----|----|----
C: O---|O---|O---|O---
R: ----|----|----|----

**Note:** The first beat now has both a cymbal hit (crash) and a hi-hat, fulfilling the request.
