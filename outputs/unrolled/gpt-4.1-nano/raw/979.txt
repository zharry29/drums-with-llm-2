Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** `o---|--o-|o---|--o-` — kicks on some subdivisions, notably beat 2 and 4.
- **Snare (S):** `----|X---|--X-|----` — snare on beats 2 and 3.
- **Hi-hat (H):** `----|x---|----|x---` — hi-hat on the second subdivision of beat 2 and 4.
- **Toms (T):** `----|----|----|----` — no tom hits.
- **Crash (C):** `----|----|----|----` — no crash.
- **Ride (R):** `x---|X-x-|x---|X-x-` — ride cymbal hits on all beats with a pattern, still quite busy.

**Goal:** Make the pattern less busy and simpler.

### Thought process:
- Remove most of the kick hits, perhaps only keep one per bar.
- Remove hi-hat hits on subdivisions, perhaps only keep one on beat 1 or 3.
- Remove snare hits from beat 3 or 2 for simplicity.
- Remove tom and crash to minimize activity.
- Keep only essential hits for a clean, sparse feel.

### Possible simplified pattern:
- Keep a single kick on beat 1.
- Keep a snare only on beat 3.
- Keep a single hi-hat hit on beat 1.
- Remove all other hits, especially ride and extra hi-hat hits for simplicity.

### Final pattern:

```plaintext
@@@
K: O---|----|----|----
S: ----|----|--S-|----
H: o---|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
@@@
```

This version has:
- A kick on beat 1.
- A snare on beat 3.
- A simple hi-hat on the first subdivision of beat 1.
- Everything else minimized for less notes.
