Let's analyze the current groove:

- **Kick (K):** plays on beat 1 ("O--O") and beat 3 ("--O-")
- **Snare (S):** plays on part of beat 2 ("Oo-o") and beat 4 ("O--o")
- **Hi-hat (H):** pattern with alternating unaccented strokes ("X-x-") on all beats
- **Toms (T):** silent
- **Cymbals (C):** silent
- **Ride (R):** silent

**Objective:**  
To incorporate a cymbal (probably a crash or ride cymbal) along with the hi-hat support, creating fuller rhythmic support.

**Approach:**  
- Add a cymbal hit, such as a crash ("O---") on beat 1 for emphasis.
- Keep the hi-hat pattern, which already provides a steady pulse.
- Keep the groove dynamics intact.

### Final plan:
- Keep the hi-hat as is ("X-x-")
- Add a crash cymbal on beat 1 ("O---")

### Final groove:

K: O--O|----|--O-|----
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
C: O---|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

```

This ensures a prominent crash cymbal on beat 1, while the hi-hat maintains a consistent rhythm supporting the groove. The existing snare and kick patterns are preserved for rhythmic integrity.
