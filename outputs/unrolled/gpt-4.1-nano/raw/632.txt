To fulfill the request:

- Add a kick hit at the very beginning, so change the K pattern from `----` to `O---` to include a hard kick on the first 16th note.
- Add a ride cymbal hit at the very beginning, so change R from `x---` to `O---` to emphasize a ride hit at the first note.

**Changes summary:**
- K: `O---|----|----|----`
- R: `O---|X-x-|x---|X-x-`

Here's the final edited groove:

K: O---|----|----|----
S: ----|----|----|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|X-x-|x---|X-x-

This includes a kick and ride cymbal hit right at the start, exactly as requested.
