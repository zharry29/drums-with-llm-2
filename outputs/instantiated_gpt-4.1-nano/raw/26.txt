Certainly! To delay the first snare backbeat by an eighth note, I will shift the snare hit that is currently at the start of the second beat to the midpoint of the first beat. 

The original groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|O---|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

The snare hit at the start of the second beat will be moved to the midpoint of the first beat, which means:

- The snare on the second beat "O---" becomes "-O--" in the first beat.
- The second beat will now have the snare hit at the 8th note position.

Here's the updated groove:

K: O---|----|O---|----
S: ----|-O--|----|O---
H: x---|x---|x---|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----

This matches the requirement of shifting the backbeat snare by one eighth note delay.

Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!
