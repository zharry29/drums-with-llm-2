Certainly! To give the groove a more disco feel, I'll add a consistent hi-hat pattern with a closed sound on the off-beats, a steady kick pattern emphasizing the bass groove, and a snare on the 2 and 4 to create that disco thump. I'll also introduce a subtle cymbal accent on the second and fourth beats for sparkle.

Here's the disco-inspired drum groove:

K: O---|O---|O---|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----  
H: x-x-|x-x-|x-x-|x-x-
T: ----|----|----|----  
C: ----|--o-|----|--o-  
R: ----|----|----|----

Explanation:
- Kick (K) on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4 for a steady pulse.
- Snare (S) on beats 2 and 4 for the classic backbeat.
- Hi-hat (H) playing consistent eighth notes on off-beats (x-x-x-x) pattern.
- Cymbal (C) tapping lightly on the "and" of 2 and 4 (represented by "o") to add shimmer.
- Toms and ride cymbal are omitted for a tight, danceable groove.
