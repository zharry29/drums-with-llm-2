Certainly! To enhance the low frequency sounds, I will emphasize the kick drum and ride cymbal hits, making sure they align to create a fuller, deeper rhythm. Here's the edited groove with more prominent low-frequency sounds:

K: o---|--o-|o---|--o-
S: ----|S---|--S-|----
H: ----|x---|----|x---
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O---|X-x-|O---|X-x-

I've added more open ride cymbal hits (O, X) to the ride pattern, which contribute to the bass frequencies, and reinforced the kick drum with consistent open hits. Let me know if you'd like adjustments or a different emphasis!
