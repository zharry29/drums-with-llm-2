**Thought Process:**

Double time in drumming means the same rhythmic pattern is played twice as fast, effectively fitting two measures of the original beat into a single measure. For a 4/4 groove, this typically means:

- The snare, which was on beats 2 and 4, is now on 2& and 4& (the "ands" between the beats).
- The hihat (playing quarter notes) is now played as eighth notes — so every 8th note position (here, every two 16th notes) gets a hit.
- Kick hits often double up as well, but in its simplest form, we keep their placement.

Here's the original:

K: O---|----|O---|----  
S: ----|O---|----|O---  
H: X---|X---|X---|X---  

Let's build the double-time groove:

1. Hihat: Now place hihat every other 16th note (so X-x-X-x-X-x-X-x-X-x-X-x-X-x-X-x).
2. Snare: Original hits on 2 and 4, which were at 5 and 13. In double-time, hits are on 3 and 7 (for 2&) and 11 and 15 (for 4&). But in 16th notation, let's make it on 3-4 and 11-12 to give that double-time drive, just like the hihat.
3. Kick: Double-time often has kicks on 1, 3, 9, 11 — let's preserve the "feel" by putting them on the relevant 16th positions (1 and 9).

Let's lay this out:
