Let’s analyze the request:

The original groove has more than 8 notes (counting every O, o, X, x, S, s as a note).  
Our task: **No more than 8 notes in the entire groove.**

**Approach:**
- 8 notes divided over 4 bars is very sparse—an average of 2 notes per bar.
- To stay musical, I’ll spread out the hits across drums and time, but keep it minimal.

Here's a possible edit:

**Total notes chosen:**
- 2 kick drum hits
- 2 snare hits
- 4 hi-hat hits

This sums up to 8.

**Final notation:**

*This arrangement preserves a beat in each bar, but remains super minimal, using only a total of 8 notes.*
