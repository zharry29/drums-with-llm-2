Let’s break down the request:

**Analysis:**
- The original groove already has a moderate density, but to meet “less notes,” I need to further reduce the number of drum hits across all parts.
- I can do this by:
    - Removing some kick and ride hits, perhaps simplifying the snare pattern.
    - Sparse out the hihat even more (perhaps just accenting beats).
    - Toms and cymbals are already silent.

**Edit Plan:**
- For clarity, keep the essence of the groove but at a minimal form.
- I’ll keep only essential hits (e.g., one snare, a couple of kicks, a minimal ride or hihat).

**Final Groove:**
