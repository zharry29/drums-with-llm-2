To address "more low frequency sounds," I’ll focus on the instruments that produce those: kick drum (K) and toms (T). Here’s my plan:

- **Kick drum**: I can add more kicks, especially in places where there are long gaps.
- **Toms**: They’re not used in the original groove at all; I'll add some tom fills for extra low-end energy, perhaps at the end of bars for emphasis.

Here’s the new drum groove:

K: O--O|--O-|O-O-|O--O
S: ----|Oo-o|-o--|O--o
H: X-x-|X-x-|X-x-|X-x-
T: ----|----|--oO|oO--
C: ----|----|----|----
R: ----|----|----|----
