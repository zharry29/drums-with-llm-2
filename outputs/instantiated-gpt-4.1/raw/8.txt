Let's analyze and address the request:

**Current Beat Analysis:**
- **Kick (K)** and **Snare (S)** are empty: lacks rhythmic drive.
- **Hi-hat (H)** has light hits on 2 and 4, provides a backbeat but minimal energy.
- **Ride (R)** is playing every beat, but without punch from Kick and Snare, it feels thin.

**Objective:**  
Make the groove feel less empty—add body and energy, especially with Kick and Snare. Let’s add a basic rock/pop structure:  
- Place Kick on 1 and 3.
- Snare on 2 and 4.
- Reinforce Hi-hat (H), maybe filling out more 8th notes.
- Keep Ride and perhaps add a Crash on 1 for impact.

This groove is now fuller:
- Kick on 1 & 3, Snare on 2 & 4.
- Hi-hat provides constant 8th-note propulsion.
- Crash cymbal on 1.
- Ride with previous pattern for shimmer.

Let me know if you’d like it busier, funkier, or with fills!
