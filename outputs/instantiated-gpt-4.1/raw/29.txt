**Thought process:**

"Double time" generally means you play the same rhythm, but everything feels twice as fast. In traditional drum notation, this usually means:

- All events that happened on beats 1 & 3 (i.e., every 8th note) now happen every quarter note (i.e., twice as often, making the groove feel faster).
- If the original groove is one bar, double-timing it will make it feel like it's been split in half and repeated, and the tempo is perceived as doubled.

In this pattern:
- Only the Hihat and Ride are played, alternating every beat.
- 16th notes "x---" on the hats and "x---" (with variations) on the Ride, so accents/fills are already sparse.

**Double-time approach:**
- Map the groove to twice as many notes per bar, so each original 8th becomes a 16th.
- Effectively, for each original note hit, we need two hits per beat, so the pattern will have twice the density.
- That means: take each played note and insert it at both the original place and at the halfway point of the beatâ€”i.e., if it played at [1, 5, 9, 13], now play at [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15].
- Or, effectively, double up the pattern for 16th note density.

**But for a simple musical approach, a standard double-time feels like just doubling up the hats/ride, making everything hit every 8th instead of every quarter.**

Here's the new groove:
