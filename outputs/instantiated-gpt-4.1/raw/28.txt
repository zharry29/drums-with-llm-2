**Thought Process:**

- The request is to "comp with the bass guitar on each quarter note downbeat in a jazzy way."
- In jazz comping, the drummer often uses the bass drum ("feathering") lightly on every quarter note to subtly outline the time, matching the bass guitarist.  
- This means the Kick (K:) should play softly ("o") on each downbeat (every 1st note of each beat: positions 1, 5, 9, 13).
- The rest of the groove can be left as is unless we want to tweak the ride or hihat to match the jazz context (which is already jazzy with alternating x/X patterns).
- We'll use "o" for the soft jazz kick.  
- No extra snare, tom, or cymbal nuances are needed unless specified.
