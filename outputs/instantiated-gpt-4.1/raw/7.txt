To "feather the kick drum" means to play the kick drum very softly and steadily, often on every quarter note, in addition to the main groove. This creates a light but constant pulse beneath the groove.

Let's analyze the original kick line:
K: O---|----|O---|----

We see the kick drum only on the 1st and 9th 16th notes (the downbeats of beats 1 and 3) and both are accented (O).

To feather the kick, we add a soft kick (o) on every quarter note (the 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th 16th notes), but keep the original accents for the main groove. Where a hard kick (O) and a feathered (o) coincide, the hard kick takes precedence.

Here's the updated kick line:
- 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th positions get a soft kick (o), unless they're already a hard kick (O).
- In this groove, beats 1 and 3 are O, so beats 2 and 4 get o.

Thus, the kick line is:
K: O---|o---|O---|o---

All other lines remain unchanged.
