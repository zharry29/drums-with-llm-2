Let's analyze the request:

- “More dynamic” generally means adding variation in velocity/articulation, e.g., mixing hard (O) and soft (o) hits.
- “Same amount of ride” means the same number and placement of hits in the Ride line, but their articulation can vary for dynamics.
- The ride pattern is currently empty in your groove. The only cymbal in use is the toms (which is unusual notation, but we’ll adhere to your given system).
- Maybe you mean toms should instead be rides, or maybe you want to add ride cymbal content.

Assuming you want ride used like toms in your example, we can transfer the tom pattern to the ride and add more dynamic by alternating O and o (hard and soft hits).

Here’s the reworked groove with more dynamic ride (alternating articulation):

K: O---|O---|----|O---
S: ----|----|O---|----
H: ----|----|----|----
T: ----|----|----|----
C: ----|----|----|----
R: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-

If this is not what you meant, feel free to clarify how you'd like the ride to be used!
