Let's process your edit request step by step:

**Request:**  
- Add a kick hit (O) and a cymbal hit (O) at the very beginning.

**Current pattern, first 16th note:**  
- Kick ("K") is "-", should become "O"
- Cymbal ("C") is "-", should become "O"

For the rest of the groove, keep the pattern unchanged.

**Resulting groove:**
