Let's analyze the request:
- The user wants **something to be played on every 16-th note**.
- That means on every position (16 positions per bar per instrument), at least one instrument must play something (no all-dashes columns).
- We are free to choose which instruments articulate where, but the original groove's character and logic should be maintained.

**Strategy:**
- For the strongest, most consistent feel, put the hihat (H) on all 16th notes, using variations of (x, X, o, O) for dynamic interest.
- Fill in kicks (K) and snares (S) to match, ensuring that in all 16 positions, at least one instrument hits.
- Sprinkle in toms (T), crash (C), and ride (R) to fill gaps, keeping dynamics in mind.
- It’s okay if the groove differs from the source, as long as it honors the rule and is musical.

**Let’s Construct the Groove:**
- H: Fill every slot. Use ‘x’ for most, and put ‘O’ on the downbeats for interest.
- K and S: Alternate in a funk style, fully filling some gaps not covered by H.
- Fill in some T, C, and R to cover any rare gaps.

Here’s the edited drum groove with something on every 16th note:

K: O-o-|O-o-|O-o-|O-o-
S: -O-O|-O-O|-O-O|-O-O
H: xXxX|xXxX|xXxX|xXxX
T: -o--|-o--|-o--|-o--
C: --O-|--O-|--O-|--O-
R: O---|O---|O---|O---

**Now, every 16-th note has at least one instrument playing.**
