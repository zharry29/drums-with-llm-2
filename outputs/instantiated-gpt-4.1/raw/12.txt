Let's analyze your groove and your request:

- Your current groove **does not have any tom hits at all** (the Toms line is all ----|----|----|----).
- Your request says: "I don't want tom on beat 4 but everything else is fine."  
  - Since there is already no tom hit on beat 4 (or anywhere!), **nothing needs to be changed**.

So the drum groove remains the same:
