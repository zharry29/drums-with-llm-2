Let's break down the request and process the edit:

**Request:**  
- Play the closed hihat on **all 16th notes**.  
- Accent (make it X) on **quarter note down beats** (the first note of each beat in the bar).

Let's apply this to the Hihat line:

There are 16 16th notes in a bar, falling on 4 beats (downbeats: 1, 5, 9, 13).
- So positions 1, 5, 9, and 13 should be **X** (accented), all other positions should be **x** (soft closed hit).

Now let's assemble the entire pattern with just the Hihat line changed. Everything else remains the same as the original groove.

Here is the result, as requested:
