Absolutely! To create a more "metal" groove, let’s consider typical characteristics of metal drumming:

- **Double kick drums:** Metal often features rapid or double kick drum patterns.
- **Snare on 2 and 4:** Keeping a strong backbeat.
- **Consistent, aggressive hi-hats or ride cymbals:** Sometimes swapped for a ride or crash on each quarter note for intensity.
- **Occasional crashes:** Accentuating the start of measures or phrases.

Let’s adapt your groove:

1. **Kick drum:** Let’s give it a double kick feel, at least on some beats.
2. **Snare:** Keep it steady and aggressive on 2 and 4.
3. **Hihat or Ride:** Let’s use the ride cymbal on all quarter notes for a classic metal feel.
4. **Crash:** Crash at the start of the measure for impact.

Here’s an updated metal groove:

**Explanation:**  
- Kick drums are doubled on every first and third sixteenth of each beat, giving a fast, driving double bass style.
- Snares are on beats 2 and 4.
- Ride cymbal drives each beat for intensity.
- Crash hits at the top of the bar for accent.
- No tom fills yet—this is a basic, driving metal backbeat, ready for further fills or variations as the song demands.
