The original groove second beat (the 2nd group of 4 characters after the first |) for the snare (S) is:

S: X---

It has a hard sidestick hit on the first 16th note of the second beat, and no other hits.

The request is to have the snare played on every 16-th note in the second beat. That means all four characters in the second beat (positions 5 to 8) should have a snare hit.

In the snare notation:
- O = hard hit on the head
- o = soft open hit on the head
- X = hard sidestick hit
- x = soft sidestick hit

Since the original hit is a hard sidestick (X), but the request doesn't specify articulation, it makes sense to keep consistent articulation across all 4 notes. Let's choose hard sidestick hits (X) on all four 16th notes for the snare in the second beat.

Therefore, the second beat for snare will become:

S: XXXX

Let's update the snare line accordingly, changing the second beat from "X---" to "XXXX".

Full original snare line:
S: ----|X---|--X-|----

After change:
S: ----|XXXX|--X-|----

Other lines remain unchanged.
