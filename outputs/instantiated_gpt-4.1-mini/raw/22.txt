To make this groove sound more like a metal groove, I will make some typical metal drumming adjustments:

1. Increase the aggressiveness of the kick drum by having more double kicks or fast notes for that driving rhythm.
2. Use a louder, more consistent snare, often on beats 2 and 4.
3. Increase the intensity and speed of the hi-hat or replace it partially with ride cymbal patterns, often using harder hits and faster subdivisions.
4. Add some tom fills or rolls to increase the heaviness and complexity.
5. Use crash cymbals to accentuate transitions or important beats.

Changes based on these ideas:
- On the kick: add double kick notes, especially fast notes on 16th notes.
- On the snare: put strong hits on 2 and 4 with hard hits (O).
- On the hi-hat: replace the softer hits with mostly closed hard hits (X) on 16th notes for galloping feel.
- Add tom hits on 3rd or 4th beat for a fill.
- Add crash cymbal on the 1st beat of some bars for accents.
- Possibly add ride cymbal as an alternative or supplement to hi-hat with fast hits.

Hereâ€™s the new groove with those in mind:
