The original groove has notes primarily on the Hihat and Ride cymbal, with closed hits on the Hihat at the second and fourth beats, and a pattern of closed and hard bow hits on the Ride cymbal throughout the bar.

The request is for "Less notes," so I want to simplify by reducing the number of hits while keeping some rhythmic feel.

- For the Hihat, I will remove the hit at the fourth beat so there is only one closed hihat note at the second beat.
- For the Ride cymbal, I will reduce the notes by removing some of the bow hits and keeping just one hit at the second beat to maintain a groove but with fewer notes.

This should significantly reduce the number of hits while maintaining some rhythm.

Final groove:
