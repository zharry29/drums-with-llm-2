The numbering of each folder corresponds to the numbered speaker icons in the paper. In each demo, there are 3 files:
- `*_groove.wav* is the generated, edited 1-bar groove, concerted to MIDI and rendered as audio
- `*_looped.wav* is the above audio file looped 4 times, to provide a better understanding of its application
- `*_looped_context.wav* is the above audio file looped 4 times mixed with a back track, to provide a better understanding of its application within musical context
